 The '''Norns''' are female [[deity|deities]] in [[Norse mythology]] who govern [[fate]]. Their names are [[Urd]] (what has been), [[Verdandi]] (what is) and [[Skuld]] (what is to come). Skuld is also the name of a [[Valkyrie]]. 
 
 The Norns are at the base of the ash tree [[Yggdrasil]] (or, according to some versions, above the [[Bifröst|Bifröst bridge]]). They spin threads and weave the [[tapestry]] of [[fate]]s.  Each person's life is a thread in their [[loom]]. The length of the thread is the length of the person's life. Even the gods have their threads and are therefore not immortal, though the Norns hide the strings from the gods.  So everything is set out beforehand.  There is no [[luck]], there is no [[random]]ness, everything is determined by destiny. 
 
 The [[Greek mythology|Greeks]] called deities similar to the Norns [[Moirae]], and the [[Roman mythology|Romans]] called them [[Parcae]]. 
 
 The three Norns appear at the beginning of [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[opera]] [[Götterdämmerung]] and foretell the downfall of the gods when a thread of fate breaks.
