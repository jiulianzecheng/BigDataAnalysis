 '''''Kanuites''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[viverrid]] carnivore. < ref name=FortTernan > {{cite journal |author=Lars Werdelin |title='Middle Miocene Carnivora and Hyaenodonta from Fort Ternan, western Kenya |journal=Geodiversitas |year=2019 |volume=41 |issue=6 |url=http://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/sites/default/files/articles/hd/g2019v41a6-pdfa.pdf}} < /ref >  It lived in [[Africa]], during the [[Miocene]] epoch. The viverrids are a group of [[civet cat]]s, and the group is rather cat-like in its form and life-style. 
 
 ==Description== 
 ''Kanuites'' was about {{convert|90|cm|ft|sigfig=1}} long, and looked very similar to modern [[genet]]s. It was probably an [[omnivore]] and may have had retractable claws, like a [[felidae|feline]]. It may have lived in trees for part of its life. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer D. |year=1999 |title=The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7 |publisher=Marshall Editions |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7/page/225 225] |isbn=1-84028-152-9}} < /ref >
