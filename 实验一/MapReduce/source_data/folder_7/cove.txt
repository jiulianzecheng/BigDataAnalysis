 A '''cove''' is a small type of [[bay]] or [[coast]]al [[inlet]]. Coves usually have narrow, restricted [[:wikt:entrance|entrances]]. They are often circular or [[:wikt:oval|oval]], and are often found in a larger bay. Small, narrow, sheltered bays, inlets, [[creek (tidal)|creeks]], or recesses in a coast are often considered coves. The term can also be used to describe a [[valley]] between two [[Mountain|mountain ridges]]. < ref > ''Seekers of Scenery: Travel Writing from Southern Appalachia, 1840-1900'', eds. Kevin E.

These rocks further erode to form a circular bay with a narrow entrance called a cove.
