[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|325px|Giving to the [[Poverty|poor]] is considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religions.]] 
 
 '''Altruism''' (or '''selflessness''') is concern for the [[wikt:well-being|well-being]] of others. A truly altruistic act is something done completely for the benefit of another, without concern for the self. It usually involves [[Sacrifice|sacrificing]] something (time, effort or [[possession]]s), with no expectation of receiving anything in return (including recognition for the act of giving). It is considered a [[virtue]] in many cultures and a basic aspect of most [[religion]]s. It is the opposite of [[selfishness]]. 
 
 Altruism is different from acts done out of [[wikt:responsibility|responsibility]], [[loyalty]] or [[moral]] [[wikt:obligation|obligation]] towards a specific individual (such as a [[god]], a [[Monarch|king]] or a [[government]]). Whether  " pure "  altruism is possible has been debated by [[scholar]]s for thousands of years. One theory says that no act of giving, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly selfless, because the person will receive personal [[wikt:grateful|gratification]] from it (that is, a [[Emotion|feeling]] of [[wikt:satisfaction|satisfaction]] that they have done something good for another). Whether this theory is correct depends on whether such feelings qualify as a 'reward' or 'benefit'. 
 
 The word  " altruism "  was given by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=altruism (n .) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |access-date=19 September 2014}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |last1=Teske |first1=Nathan |title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation |date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park, Pa. |isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C}} < /ref >  He derived it from the Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning  " [[alterity|other people]] "  or  " somebody else " . < ref > {{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog/page/n81 64]|url=https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog}} < /ref > 
 
 Altruism in [[Biology|biological]] observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is  " intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards " . < ref > {{Cite journal|title = Altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = Steinberg|first = David|date = 2010|journal = Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=249–57|doi = 10.1017/s0963180109990521|pmid = 20226108|s2cid = 30534335}} < /ref >  In one sense, the opposite of altruism is [[Spite (sentiment)|spite]]; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit. 
 
 The concept of altruism has long been studied in [[philosophy]] and [[ethics]]. The term was originally used in the 19th century by [[sociologist]] and [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]]. It has become an important topic for [[psychologist]]s (especially those that study [[evolutionary psychology]]), [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] and [[Ethology|ethologists]]. The scholars of each field have developed different ideas about altruism. All agree that altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

 In the study of [[Ethology|animal behaviour]], altruism is seen in social animals when an individual willingly sacrifices itself for the [[Fitness|better survival]] of the group. < ref name= " Bell2008 " > {{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| url = https://archive.org/details/selectionmechani00bell_245| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 978-0-19-856972-5| pages = [https://archive.org/details/selectionmechani00bell_245/page/n381 367]–368 }} < /ref >  There are several theories about how this behaviour has come about under [[Evolution#Altruism and group selection|evolution]] by [[natural selection]].

 ==In religion== 
 [[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Buddhist [[monk]]s collecting alms.]] 
 Most, if not all, of the world's [[religion]]s promote selflessness as a very important moral value. It forms part of the central philosophies of Buddhism, [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Sikhism]], as well as many other religions. 
 
 [[Buddhism]] teaches love and compassion for all forms of life ([[ahimsa]]). Love is the wish that all beings be [[Happiness|happy]], and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from [[Dukkha|suffering]]. It considers all living things to be equal. Unlike most other religions, Buddhists believe that the consequences of our actions come not from [[punishment]]s based on moral judgment, but from the law of [[karma]] (''kamma''). Karma is the [[natural law]] of cause and effect. In this law, we experience the effects of what we cause: if you cause suffering, then as a natural consequence you will experience suffering; if you cause happiness, then as a natural consequence you will experience happiness. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of [[Samsara|samsāra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirvāna]]. < ref > {{cite book| last = Davids| first = Rhys| title = Buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LljcZ_LBeL0C & pg=PA119| year = 2007| publisher = Lightning Source Incorporated| isbn = 978-1-4067-5628-9| page = 119 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| author = Padmasiri de Silva| title = Environmental Philosophy and Ethics in Buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M4T3C6ndfZIC & pg=PA41| year = 1998| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-21316-9| page = 41 }} < /ref > 
 
 In [[Sufism]], the idea of ''īthār'' (selflessness) is defined as preferring others over yourself. For Sufis, this means devotion to others and completely forgetting concern for oneself. It teaches sacrifice for the sake of the greater good. [[Islam]] considers those practicing ''īthār'' as abiding by the highest degree of [[virtue]]. < ref > {{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }} < /ref >  In ''īthār'', attention is focused on everything that exists except for the self. < ref name= " Neusner2005 " > {{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob| title = Altruism in World Religions| url = https://archive.org/details/altruisminworldr0000unse| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ.
