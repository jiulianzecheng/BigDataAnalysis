 '''Resurrection''' means bringing someone back to [[afterlife|life after they have died]]. 
 
 ==Polytheistic religions== 
 The idea of resurrection is found in writings of ancient [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions in the [[Middle East]]. Some [[Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Canaanite]] writings tell of gods being resurrected, such as [[Osiris]] and [[Baal]]. 
 
 In [[Greek mythology]], many men and women were given [[immortality|eternal life]] by being resurrected from the dead. In their stories, some who came back to life as gods were [[Alcmene]], Castor, [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]]. But the Greek [[philosopher]]s at that time did not believe in a physical rebirth. 
 
 ==Abrahamic religions== 
 
 === Christianity === 
 {{main|Resurrection of Jesus}} 
 [[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus Christ]] was resurrected. They also believe in resurrection for all people after they die. This is based on the [[Gospel]]s and on [[Saint Paul]]'s writings in the [[New Testament]].  The resurrection of Jesus is the Christian belief that he returned to life by a [[miracle]]. He died by [[crucifixion]] on Friday and rose from his [[tomb]] to new life on Sunday morning. This belief is celebrated at [[Easter]]. 
 
 The resurrection of Jesus Christ is written about by the [[evangelist]]s in the New Testament. They are the [[Writer|writers]] of the four Gospels in the New Testament.  Christians believe the resurrection is a central part of the Christian faith. Jesus died on the cross to save mankind.  When he was resurrected, Jesus defeated [[death]].  He is alive forever and sitting at God's right hand on a [[throne]]. This gives Christians the hope of a new life after death. This is because his resurrection mirrors the future for all Christians after they die. 
 
 With Jesus Christ and with humans, the Bible shows that the resurrected body is changed from the original.  This is because the human body, while alive, is weak and frail.  But, the resurrected person lives for ever. 
 
 All four [[Gospel]]s tell about Jesus being raised from the dead. They also write about three times that Jesus brings a dead person back to life: 
 * [[Daughter of Jairus]].{{bibleref2c|Mk|5:21-43}} Jairus, a patron of a [[synagogue]], asks Jesus to heal his daughter, but while Jesus is on the way, Jairus is told his daughter was dead. Jesus tells him she was only sleeping, and wakes her with the words [[Aramaic of Jesus#Talitha kum (Ταλιθα κουμ)|Talitha kum.]] 
 * [[The Young Man from Nain]].{{bibleref2c|Lk|7:11-17}} A young man, the son of a widow, was on the way to be buried in Nain. Jesus sees the widow crying and so he tells her not to [[cry]]. Jesus tells the dead man inside to get up, and he does so. 
 * The [[Raising of Lazarus]].{{bibleref2c|Jn|11:1-44}} A close friend of Jesus who had been dead for four days is brought back to life. Jesus goes to his grave and commands him to get up. 
 
 === Islam === 
 In [[Islam]], the [[Quran]] refers to a bodily resurrection of all those who have died. 
 This will be followed by a final time of trouble and eternal division of the righteous and wicked. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e588?_hi=1 & _pos=2|title=Eschatology - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|date=2008-05-06|publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com|accessdate=2017-07-03}} < /ref >  Islamic apocalyptic literature describing [[Armageddon]] is often known as The Great Massacre or ''ghaybah'' in Shī'a Islam. The righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of [[Jannah]] (Paradise), while the unrighteous are punished in Hell. 
 
 == Science == 
 According to [[Alcor]], resurrection of [[:en:Legal death|legally dead]] people will be possible in the far future.
