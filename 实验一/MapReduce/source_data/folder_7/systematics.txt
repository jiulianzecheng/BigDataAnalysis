'''Systematics''' is one of the main fields in [[biology]]. It is closely related to [[taxonomy]]. 
 
 Systematics is the study of the diversification of [[life]] on the planet [[Earth]], both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time.  
 
 Relationships are usually seen as [[evolution]]ary trees ([[cladistics|cladograms]], [[phylogenetic tree]]s, [[phylogeny|phylogenies]]).  
 
 Phylogenies have two components, ''branching order'' (showing group relationships) and ''branch length'' (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher [[taxa]] are used to study the evolution of [[Trait (biology)|traits]] (anatomical or molecular characteristics), and the distribution of organisms ([[biogeography]]). Systematics is used to help us understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth. 
 
 " Systematic biology "  and  " taxonomy "  are terms that are often confused and used interchangeably. They were defined as follows: < ref > Michener, Charles D. ''et al.'' 1970.

 Systematics is the field which (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations.  < br / > Taxonomy is that part of systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.
