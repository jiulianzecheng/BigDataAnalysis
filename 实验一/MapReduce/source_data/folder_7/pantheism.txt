 '''Pantheism''' is the belief that [[God]] and the [[universe]] are [[wikt:equivalent|equivalent]] (the same thing). A pantheist believes that everything that exists is a part of God or that God is a part of everything that exists. The name pantheism comes from the Greek words theism (belief in God) and pan (all).  
 
 Any [[doctrine]] or philosophy that believes that the universe and everything in it is God is said to be pantheistic. Most pantheists believe the universe is sacred and the earth and nature are divine. 
 Most of the early Greek philosophers from [[Thales]] on to the [[Stoic]]s believed in some sort of pantheism. 
 
 Pantheism is an important part of many eastern religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], and modern religions such as [[Druidism]]. 
 
 Some western philosophers such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] and some scientists are pantheists. 
 
 Some [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Sufism|Sufis]] are Pantheists. However, their majority believes that while God is in everything, there is more to God than just the universe. 
 
 There are several different types of pantheism, including [[panpsychism]] (The belief the universe itself has a mind), [[naturalistic pantheism]] (The belief the universe is identifiable with the title of  " God " , as it can be seen as a wondrous and transcendent power), or the worship of [[nature]] as a life-giving force.
