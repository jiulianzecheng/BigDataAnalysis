 '''''XPilot''''' is [[multiplayer]] 2D space action [[video game]]. It is an [[open source]] game, and its first version was released in 1991. 
 
 == Development == 
 ''XPilot'' was created in 1991 by Bjørn Stabell and Ken Ronny Schouten, students in computer science at the [[Tromsø University College|Tromsø university]] ([[Norway]]), as a multiplayer game similar to ''Thrust''. They received a lot of patches and feedback when they released the first public version. The game has been improved a lot by players from all the world and has many contributors. Originally only available on [[UNIX]], it was ported on the [[MacOS|Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It has been [[forked]] and new versions appeared: [[XPilot 5]] and XPilot NG (Next Generation). < ref > {{in lang|en}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080531032533/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds3-2/xpilot.html The Story of ''XPilot''], by Bjørn Stabell and Ken Ronny Schouten, archived by Internet Archive. < /ref > 
 
 In 2009 a version was released for [[iPhone]] and [[iTouch]]. Several projects are currently in progress: a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] version of XPilot, an optimised version for the ''Blood's Music'' map and a project to improve the [[artificial intelligence]]. < ref > {{in lang|en}} [http://www.xpilot.org/development/ XPilot Development], on the original ''XPilot'' website. < /ref >
