 '''Euroa''' is a town in north-east [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] about 147 kilometers from Melbourne. < ref name= " age " > {{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Victoria/Euroa/2005/02/17/1108500206446.html|title=Euroa|date=February 8, 2004|publisher=The Age|language=English|accessdate=2010-05-21}} < /ref >  It is close to the Strathbogie Ranges. In 2006 there were 2,776 people living in the town. < ref name= " ABS "  / >  The name ''Euroa'' comes from an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning  " joyful " . 
 
 == History == 
 [[Thomas Mitchell|Major Mitchell]] camped on the banks of the [[Seven Creeks]] at Euroa during his 1836 expedition from Sydney. 
   
 The Post Office opened on 1 January 1854 as the township was settled. < ref name =  " a " > {{Citation

The Kelly Gang got away with about £2000. < ref name= " nk " > {{cite web|url=http://www.nedkellytouringroute.com.au/home/index.php?option=com_content & task=view & id=22 & Itemid=51|title=Euroa Information|work=The Ned Kelly Touring Route|accessdate=2009-11-16}} < /ref >  There are a number of historic buildings still standing in Euroa. These include the Farmers Arms Hotel which was built in 1876, and is now used as a [[museum]]. < ref name= " tv " > {{cite web|url=http://www.travelvictoria.com.au/euroa/|title=Euroa Information and Attractions|work=Travel Victoria|accessdate=2009-11-16}} < /ref >  Other buildings are the post office (1890), the old  National Bank buildings (1885), the Euroa Hotel (1884) and Blairgowrie House (1890). The first church built in Euroa was the Catholic Church (1867). < ref name=tv/ > 
 
 The Euroa court house was built in 1892 at a cost of £1354. It was designed by architect J.T.Kelleher, but many now believe it was the work of A.J.McDonald. The court house was closed in 1989. < ref > {{cite book|last=Challinger|first=Michael|title=Historic Court Houses of Victoria|publisher=Palisade Press|location=Ringwood, Victoria|date=2001|pages=84|isbn=0646413155|language=English}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Sheep]] farming was a major business, with fine wool Saxon merino sheep being introduced in 1851. < ref name=nk/ >  Farmers are now making more money from horses. 
 
 == Facilities == 
 Euroa is roughly midway between [[Melbourne]] and [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]]. The area is very flat, although the [[Strathbogie Ranges]] about 20 & nbsp;km south east of the town. < ref name=tv/ > 
 
 Euroa has several retirement villages, one high school, and two primary schools. The Shire of Strabogie is based in Euroa. 
 
 The main road from [[Melbourne]] northward is the [[Hume Highway]]. A by-pass was built around the town and since then Euroa has been a quiet town with little growth or business. 
 
 The town is located on the main [[North East railway line, Victoria|North East railway]], and is served by [[V/Line]] passenger services. 
 
 == Sport == 
 The town has an [[Australian Rules Football]] team, the  " Euroa Magpies " , competing in the [[Goulburn Valley Football League]]. < ref name =  " d " > {{Citation | last = Full Points Footy | title = Euroa | url = http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Euroa.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-25 | archive-date = 2008-07-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724163502/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/euroa.htm | url-status = dead }} < /ref >
