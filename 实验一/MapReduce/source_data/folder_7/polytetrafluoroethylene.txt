 [[File:Blintzes in frying pan.jpg|thumb|PTFE is often used to coat non-stick frying pans as it is [[hydrophobic]] and has a fairly high heat resistance.]] 
 In [[chemistry]], '''Polytetrafluoroethylene''' (often shortened to '''PTFE''') is a [[polymer]] of [[tetrafluoroethylene]]. It is a [[fluoropolymer]], because the polymerization is based on strong [[covalent bond]] < nowiki/ > s of [[fluorine]] and [[carbon]]. Polytetrafluoroethylene is not very reactive. It also repels [[oil]] and [[water]]. [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] developed it in 1938. 
 
 It is better known by its trade-names, ''Teflon'' and ''Gore-Tex''. Teflon is a coating for [[frying pan]]s, among others. Gore-Tex is stretched PTFE, used as a [[membrane]] in [[clothing]]. 
 
 == Problems == 
 [[Perfluorooctanoic acid]] was formerly used to produce Polytetrafluoroethylene. It is very [[toxic]] for people and may cause [[cancer]]. In the 2010s it was replaced with other chemicals.  
 
 The [[precursor]]s for many [[chemical weapon]]s are highly [[corrosion|corrosive]], so their containers are often treated with Polytetrafluoroethylene. For this reason, the export of Polytetrafluoroethylene from the [[European Union]] may need a special [[permit]].
