When people say something is a quality product that means that the product is of good quality. Usually higher-quality products cost more money, because the [[material]]s used to make them are better, or the way they were made was more [[wikt:effective|effective]]. In other words, things that are low quality are [[wikt:cheap|cheap]]. 
 
 Quality is understood differently by different people, depending on what they consider quality to be. Generally, though, it is how well a product is suited to the purpose it was made for.
