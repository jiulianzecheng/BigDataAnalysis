The '''Langar''' ({{lang-pa|ਲੰਗਰ  لنگر}}) is a common [[kitchen]] where food is served at a [[Sikh temple]] (''Gurdwara''). Langar was introduced to Sikhs by gurus Nanak, who was the founder of Sikhism and also the first Guru. Because of Guru Nanak's belief in the oneness of humanity he offered free meals to everyone. One is attached to every temple, and the food is served to all the visitors for free. At the langar, only [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] food is served. It is usually bread (poori), [[yogurt]] and [[lentils]]. [[Samosa]]s and [[spring roll]]s are served on special occasions. [[Kheer]] may be served as a dessert. 
 
 The langar is open to both Sikhs and people who are not Sikhs. After a person eats at the langar they are not supposed to eat meat for the rest of the day.
