 The '''Metéora''' ({{lang-el|Μετέωρα}},  " suspended rocks " ,  " suspended in the air "  or  " in the heavens above " ) is the name for a number of [[monastery|monasteries]] in [[Greece]]. Several  [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[monastery|monasteries]] are part of the complex, located in [[Kalambaka]], [[Greece]]. The site is almost as important as [[Mount Athos]]. < ref name= " meteora " > Sofianos, D.Z.:  " Metéora " . Holy Monastery of Great Meteoro, 1991. < /ref >   The [[monastery|monasteries]] are built on natural sandstone rock pillars, at the northwestern edge of the [[Thessaly|Plain of Thessaly]] near the Peneios river and [[Pindus Mountains]], in central [[Greece]]. The Metéora is home to six [[monastery|monasteries]] and is included on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. Metéora's [[World_Heritage_Site#Selection criteria|criteria]] < ref > http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/ retrieved November 7, 2007 < /ref >  for the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site are I, II, IV, V and VII. < ref > http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/455/documents/ retrieved November 2, 2007 < /ref >
