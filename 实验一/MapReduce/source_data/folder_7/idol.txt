An '''idol''' is a religious item that represents a [[god]]. It can also mean someone who is admired by many people, like a [[Pop icon|pop idol]]. Idolatry refers to the [[worship]] of idols. 
 
 [[Christian]]s disagree about what [[idolatry]] is. [[Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] see [[Christian art]] and [[icon]]s as good, because they see [[Christ]]'s [[Incarnation]] as having made images of God lawful.  < ref > {{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=The Holy See|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm|accessdate=2013-07-24}} < /ref >  However many [[Protestant]]s regard much Catholic [[art]] as idolatry. < ref > {{cite web|title=Christian Assemblies International|publisher=CAI|url=http://www.cai.org/bible-studies/word-protestant|access-date=2013-07-24|archive-date=2013-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704095604/http://www.cai.org/bible-studies/word-protestant|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 This is due to differences in the understanding of the [[Ten Commandments]].  " You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. "  (RSV [[Exodus]] 20:3-6) 
 
 [[Islam]]ic art is often based on [[Geometric abstraction]] or [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] to avoid idolatry, but Jewish art is somewhat broader. < ref > {{cite web|title=Rabbi Jessica Spitalnic Brockman on Jewish Art|publisher=My Jewish Learning|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Art/History_and_Theory/Jewish_Art_History.shmtl}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Hindus have [[murti]]s, a term often translated as “idols”.
