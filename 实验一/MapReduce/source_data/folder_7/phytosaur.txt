 '''Phytosaurs''' are an [[extinct]] group of large semi-[[aquatic]] [[Upper Triassic]] [[archosaur]]s.  
 
 Phytosaurs were long-snouted and heavily [[armour]]ed, bearing a remarkable resemblance to modern [[crocodile]]s in size, appearance, and lifestyle. < ref > Benton M.J. 1990. ''The reign of the reptiles''. Crescent, New York. p75 < /ref >  This is an example of [[Convergent evolution|convergence]] or [[parallel evolution]].  
 
 The name 'phytosaur' means 'plant reptile': the first fossils of phytosaurs were mistakenly thought to belong to plant eaters. The sharp teeth in phytosaur jaws clearly show they were [[predators]]. 
 
 Although phytosaurs were not true crocodilians, they were more closely related to the crocodilians than to other modern reptiles. < ref > Jones, Andrew S.; Butler, Richard J. 2018. A new phylogenetic analysis of Phytosauria (Archosauria: Pseudosuchia) with the application of continuous and geometric morphometric character coding. ''PeerJ.'' '''6''': e5901. [https://peerj.com/articles/5901/] < /ref >  Crocodiles did not become phytosaur-like until the [[Lower Jurassic]].  " Consensus generally places phytosaurs as basal crurotarsans, possibly the basal-most group " . < ref name=Archo > Brusatte, Stephen L. ''et al'' 2010. The higher-level phylogeny of Archosauria (Tetrapoda: Diapsida). ''Journal of Systematic Palaeontology''. '''8''': 1, 3{{ndash}}47. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14772010903537732#.UzrWCttrWHM] < /ref > 
 
 Phytosaurs had a nearly global distribution. Fossils have been recovered from [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[India]], [[Morocco]], [[Thailand]], [[Brazil]] and [[Madagascar]].
