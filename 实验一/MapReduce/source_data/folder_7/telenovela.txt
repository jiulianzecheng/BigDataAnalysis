A '''telenovela''', or simply  '''novela''', is a [[serial]] [[drama]] [[television programme|television program]]. It is popular in [[Latin America]]n, [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Spain|Spanish]] television programming. Telenovelas are different from [[soap opera]]s, because unlike soap operas, telenovelas have an ending and do not run for many years. They usually come to an end after one [[Season (television)|television season]] (which is usually less than one year) or at most two television seasons (which is less than two years). Telenovelas rarely run more than two seasons. The telenovela combines drama with the [[19th century]] ''[[feuilleton]]'' and the Latin American [[radionovela]].  They are often used to give [[culture|cultural]] messages by adding them into [[storyline]]s. < ref > {{Cite news

 Because the telenovela is similar to the [[United States|American]] [[soap opera]], the telenovela is often called a  " '''Spanish soap opera''' "  in the [[United States]]. While most [[English language]] soap operas have no ending, almost all telenovelas run for a limited time. They are usually shown five or six days a week and run for an average of 120 [[episode]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.telenovelagarden.info |title=Telenovela market |accessdate=2007-07-15 |last=Hecht |first=John |date=2006-09-26 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-date=2013-02-18 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130218061853/http://www.telenovelagarden.info/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
