 '''Kappa''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Κ κ''') is the letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] used to represent the  " k "  sound in [[Ancient Greek|Ancient]] and [[Modern Greek language|Modern]] Greek. In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of 20. Letters that came from it include the Roman [[K]] and Cyrillic [[К]]. 
 
 The letter κ always stands for the sound  " k "  in Greek. It is customary to transliterate (re-write) κ as  " c "  in English, but this is somewhat problematic since c is pronounced as  " s "  before e, i and y (which does not happen in Greek). 
 
 In [[mathematics]], the lowercase  < math > \kappa < /math >  is used to represent the [[curvature]] of a curve, while the uppercase Κ is used to represent an [[ordinal number]] which is also a [[cardinal number]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-20|title=Greek/Hebrew/Latin-based Symbols in Mathematics|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/greek-hebrew-latin-symbols/|access-date=2020-10-06|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Kappa Symbol in Greek Alphabet|url=https://www.greeksymbols.net/kappa-symbol|access-date=2020-10-06|website=www.greeksymbols.net|language=en}} < /ref >
