 The '''''Lagerordnung''''' (the  " Disciplinary and Penal Code " ) was a set of rules for [[Punishment|punishing]] [[prisoner]]s at [[Dachau concentration camp]] in [[Nazi Germany]].  On January 1, 1934, the Lagerordnung became the official rules of every concentration camp in Nazi Germany. 
 
 Also known as the ''Strafkatalog'' ([[Punishment]] Catalogue), it set out the rules the prisoners had to follow.  [[Schutzstaffel|SS guards]] were told to report to the camp commandant when a prisoner broke a rule. 
 
 The [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]] was in charge of carrying out punishment.  They did this without making sure the prisoner had actually broken the rule.  Once they were accused, prisoners had no way of proving themselves [[Innocence|innocent]]. 
 
 ==Evolution of a new penal system== 
 At first, the Nazis had built temporary concentration camps, like [[Kemna concentration camp]].  These earlier camps did not have common, agreed-upon rules.  Instead, they took the ''Lagerordnung'' from rules that were often used in police departments and prisons at the time. < ref group=* > Concentration camps [[Neustadt an der Haardt]], [[Moringen]], Kislau, Kuhberg, [[Hainichen concentration camp|Hainichen]], [[Hammerstein]], [[Fuhlsbüttel]] had such regulations. The draft of regulations for Moorland concentration camp and the edict from the ''Landeskriminalamts'' ( " State Criminal Office " ) in [[Dresden]] for [[Sachsenburg (concentration camp)|Sachsenburg concentration camp]] are also examples. Source: Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', p.35 < /ref > 
 
 There was not much difference between the rules at the early concentration camps.  Some did not allow [[smoking]]; others allowed prisoners to receive food parcels or visits from family members. The rules were still based on existing laws, and the camps were patterned after ordinary prisons. The early camps had penalties like having privileges taken away, or for more severe cases, [[solitary confinement]], a hard bed, not being given food, or being left in solitary confinement in a darkened cell.  However, there was no [[corporal punishment]]. < ref group= " * " > The only exception to this was the draft, not yet instituted, from Lutze, [[Oberpräsident]] of [[Hannover]]. This draft contained clauses where beating with a stick was allowed,  " up to 10 blows on the buttocks " . This document is dated January 1934, just after Eicke's ''Lagerordnung''. Source: Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', pp. 35-36 < /ref >  The early camps were primarily controlled by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] or the [[Gestapo]]. 
 
 However, Dachau was under the control of the [[SS]].  Sometime in May 1933, SS camp commandant [[Hilmar Wäckerle]] wrote the first ''Lagerordnung'' for a concentration camp.  It gave all legal powers to the camp commandant.  The Dachau Lagerordnung allowed prisoners to be [[Death penalty|executed]] based on a decision from two SS men who had been chosen by the commandant.  The accused prisoner would no longer have a defense.  The [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Judiciary|judicial]], and [[Legislature|legislative]] parts of government were all placed together under the camp commandant's power.  There would be no system of [[checks and balances]].  The threat of the death penalty was always there, which created a constant state of emergency for Dachau's inmates. 
 
 The first legalized murders took place at Dachau. < ref > Stanislav Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', [[International concentration camp committees|Comité International de Dachau]] Luxemburg (2002) pp. & nbsp;35-43 {{in lang|de}} < /ref >   (There would never be as many political murders in any of the other, earlier concentration camps than there were in Dachau's first few months.)  Sophie Handschuh, the mother of one of the murdered prisoners, filed a formal complaint to find out what had really happened to her son. The resulting [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] forced Himmler to replace Wäckerle. < ref name= " Klee " > Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main (2007) p. 648 {{in lang|de}} < /ref > < ref > Letter of June 2, 1933, Munich District Court Prosecutor II to the State Ministry of Justice: Subject:  " Death of [[protective custody]] prisoners at Dachau concentration camp.

Himmler arranged for Eicke to be released, asking his doctor, [[Werner Heyde]], to talk to Eicke and get him to promise to control himself. < ref > Letter from Himmler to Heyde, June 2, 1933, cited by Johannes Tuchel,  " Konzentrationslager.

 ==Expanded to all camps== 
 Six months later, on October 1, 1933, Commandant Eicke wrote a second edition of the ''Lagerordnung'', adding the [[Postenpflicht]] and introducing [[corporal punishment]] ([[Flagellation|flogging]]). The ''Lagerordnung'' established a  " state within a state. "  The second edition established an orderly system in which  " [[Reichstag Fire Decree|legally]] "  arrested [[Political prisoner|political opponents]] could be tortured and executed. 
 
 [[File:KZ Dachau-Reichspogromnacht.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Postcard from a prisoner at Dachau, with detailed rules for correspondence]] 
 
 From this point on, all SS concentration camps were to follow the Dachau model and become a  " state within a state " : shielded centers of terror with their own laws and judges, without legal defense, and with their own executable violence. 
 
 After January 1, 1934, all subsequent versions of the ''Lagerordnung'' were effective for all SS-run concentration camps.

 '''Disciplinary and Penal Code for the Detention Camp''' 
 
 '''Introduction''' 
 
 The following penalties are issued within the scope of existing camp regulations, to maintain order and discipline on the grounds of Dachau concentration camp,  
 These regulations apply to all prisoners of the DCC from the time of admission on, till the hour of discharge. 
 
 ''These rules are added on to the list of rules Dachau already has.  Its goal is to keep order and discipline at Dachau.  They apply to all prisoners, all the time.'' < br > 
 The consummate authority of punishment is in the hands of the camp commandant, who is personally responsible to the political police commander for the implementation of the rules as issued. 
 
 ''[The camp commandant has complete and total authority to punish prisoners.  He is in charge of implementing these rules.]'' < br > 
 Tolerance means weakness. Realizing this, there will be a ruthless grip there, where, in the interests of the fatherland, it appears necessary. The decent, incited [sic] ''Volksgenosse'' < ref group= " * " > ''Volksgenosse'' is a Nazi word meaning  " fellow German "  or  " fellow comrade " . < /ref >  will not come into contact with these penalties. But to the politicizing rabble-rouser and intellectual agitator & nbsp;— regardless of which direction & nbsp;— let it be said, beware, that you're not nabbed, otherwise you'll be grabbed by the neck and after your own recipe, [sic] made to hold your peace. 
 
 ''[ " Tolerance means peace. "   People who speak out against Germany will be punished badly.  People who mind their own business and do not question Germany will not be punished this way.  But people who try to cause trouble by getting people upset about politics will be forced to be quiet.]'' 
 
 §1 < ref group=* > Because there is no complete document from Dachau, §§1 through 5 and 14 through 18 are taken from the [[Lichtenburg concentration camp|Lichtenburg]] ''Lagerordnung''. The differences are primarily of minor terminology, such as names for holidays or prisoner functionary jobs. Source: Stanislav Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'' p. 406. < /ref >
