 '''Gender''' is a social word that is used to talk about how people express [[Masculinity|masculine]] (traits most people think of as [[male]]) or [[Femininity|feminine]] (traits most people think of as [[female]]) traits.  
 
 ==Definitions and history== 
 
 " Gender "  comes from the [[Latin]] word [[genus]] which meant  " kind "  or  " type " . In the few hundred years before the 1950s, the term 'gender' was used only in the field of [[grammar]]. In 1955, a [[scientist]] began to use the word ''gender'' in new ways when referring to people, in a way that was related to their '[[Sex organ|sex]]' but not quite the same. The term was not applied to other animals. They continued to have different “sexes”. 
 
 ===Grammar=== 
 
 Before the 1950s, the term 'gender' was used only in the field of [[grammar]], and only to distinguish a category of words that are called 'feminine [[nouns]]' from other words that are 'masculine nouns'.[[Gender#cite note-1| < sup > [1] < /sup > ]][[Gender#cite note-haig-2| < sup > [2] < /sup > ]] Early [[Indo-European languages]]~had three genders. [[Language]]s that come from [[Latin]] like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] have lost one, and their nouns are either feminine or masculine in gender. For example, in Spanish, 'house' (''casa'') is feminine, and 'day' (''día'') is masculine. Some languages still have three genders, like [[German language|German]]. Outside of their grammatical category, the word 'gender' was not used to refer to people. At that time, when one spoke about someone being either 'male' or 'female', the word used was ''sex''. 
 
 ==== Pronouns ==== 
 {{See also|Grammatical gender}} 
 Merriam Webster officially recognized the pronoun  " they "  as a singular use pronoun in 2019.  According to the dictionary, the word had actually been used as a non-gender binary pronoun since the 1300s.  Around the time Merriam Webster made this announcement, artist [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]] announced that their correct pronouns were actually they/them. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-09-18|title=Merriam-Webster dictionary adds 'they' as nonbinary pronoun|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/17/merriam-webster-they-nonbinary-pronoun|access-date=2020-12-13|website=the Guardian|language=en}} < /ref >   Typically, for those who identify as female, the correct pronouns are she/her, and for males, he/him. 
 
 === The difference between sex and gender === 
 Many people often use the terms  " sex  "  and  " gender "  interchangeably, however, some people now assign them two different meanings. They use the term  " sex "  to refer to the biological assignment of an individual, which is often based on scientific knowledge. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite book|title=Sexing The Body|url=https://archive.org/details/sexingbodygender00faus|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=0-465-07714-5|location=New York, New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexingbodygender00faus/page/n13 1]-29}} < /ref >  This biological determination is often made at birth.  Doctors often assign sex by looking at pre-natal images or directly inspecting genitalia at birth. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|date=2019-03-15|title=Gender/Sex, Sexual Orientation, and Identity Are in the Body: How Did They Get There?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2019.1581883|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=56|issue=4–5|pages=529–555|doi=10.1080/00224499.2019.1581883|pmid=30875248|s2cid=80624574|issn=0022-4499}} < /ref >  This determination is still based on our beliefs on gender and sex being the same. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  The problem lies in what happens when an individual falls outside of the typical categories of  " male "  or  " female " . Some medical professionals have turned to the [[Karyotype]] method to look at the [[sex chromosome]]s to determine biological sex. < ref name= " :2 "  / >   " Gender " , on the other hand, is considered by some to be more of a psychological factor.  To them, gender is determined by our expressions, and behaviors rather than scientific knowledge. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 === Gender as a social construct === 
 Typically, gender has been described by using terms such as man, woman, or even transsexual.  These terms are applied to people based on their sex, or sometimes on the basis of culturally constructed characteristics. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Although many people may be biologically assigned a sex, the gender they believe themselves to be may not align with this sex. An individual's gender is often assumed by outsiders based on cultural norms: outward appearance, body shape and size, physical activity, etc. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Gorely|first1=Trish|last2=Holroyd|first2=Rachel|last3=Kirk|first3=David|date=2003|title=Muscularity, the Habitus and the Social Construction of Gender: Towards a Gender-Relevant Physical Education|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3593313|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|volume=24|issue=4|pages=429–448|doi=10.1080/01425690301923|jstor=3593313|s2cid=144610765|issn=0142-5692}} < /ref >  Although an individual's gender identity is determined by psychology, a gender identity can be constructed by wearing particular clothing, language, actions and such, that are associated with that gender in a given society. Psychologist and feminist anthropologist [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] calls this embodiment. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 === Gender roles === 
 [[File:Michelina de Cesare.jpg|thumb|[[Michelina de Cesare]] (1841–68) was a  [[brigand]] from the South of Italy. She didn't fit the gender role assigned to women, in the 19th century. ]] 
 In 1955, [[John Money]] created the term [[gender role]] and began to use it to mean something different from sex. Gender roles are how a [[society]] views different genders and how they should act. < ref > Money, John; Hampson, Joan G; Hampson, John (October 1955).  " An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism " . ''Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp''. Johns Hopkins University. '''97''' (4): 301–19. < /ref >  An example of this would be how some people believe feminine or female people should cook and clean rather than play sports. These roles change over time and differ based on different cultures, but are often ideas that are created by people rather than coming from nature. 
 
 == Gender identity development == 
 The term [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] means the mental image someone has of themself as well as some kind of similarity with others in some particular way.  Gender identity, specifically, refers to the experiences someone has that are similar to a person of a particular gender. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Steensma|first1=Thomas|last2=Kreukels|first2=Baudewijntje|date=2013|title=Gender identity development in adolescence|url=|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=64|issue=2|pages=288–297|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.02.020|pmid=23998673|s2cid=23056757}} < /ref >   This gender identity affects how a person views themself as well as how they interact with others. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Developmental psychologists have found that the development of an identity begins in early adolescence. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Learning about what it means to be a particular gender also starts at an early age.  During adolescence, children begin to internalize the gender roles in their surroundings and  " gender intensification "  occurs. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Gender intensification means that the child feels more pressure to conform to socially sanctioned gender norms, resulting in deeper gender role differentiation for boys and girls. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Biological, can affect gender identity development as well.  Research done with animals has shown that pre-natal sex hormones affect the sexual differentiation of the brain. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 == Gender and sexual orientation == 
 === Gender binary === 
 ‘Binary’ comes from the Latin word bini meaning two together. As such binary refers to an idea in which there are only two possible options that are often opposite. This is how most people thought of gender throughout [[history]] in many parts of the world with male and female being the only two options. 
 
 Thinking of gender in this way can lead to a society with strict gender roles that are in place for a long time to think that those are natural or biological roles that each option has to conform to at birth. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Primatology is Politics by Other Means|last=Harraway|first=Donna|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Philosophy of Science|year=1984|isbn=|location=The University of Chicago|pages=490}} < /ref >  Examples of this are women who are not allowed access to [[education]] or jobs or men who are expected to not be [[emotion]]al or soft. Strict binary gender roles are also often tied to reasons for [[oppression]] of sexualities outside of the majority. Societies often enforce gender binaries due to concepts like tradition and the idea that their [[stability]] relies on keeping this binary in place. 
 
 === The LGBTQ+ community === 
 The term LGBTQ is constantly evolving and adding terms to the acronym as knowledge of the community becomes more widely known.  As of 2020, the acronym has expanded to LGBTQQIAAP, which stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-06-22|title=What do all the letters in LGBTQIA+ stand for?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/lgbtqia-meaning-full-version-stand-plus-lgbt-pride-month-acronym-a9574351.html|access-date=2020-12-15|website=The Independent|language=en}} < /ref >  The community is, however, mostly referred to as the LGBTQ+ community. 
 
 ==== Intersex ==== 
 Intersex is the word used to describe the condition where a person has genitals that are not clearly male or female. < ref name= " :0 "  / >   There is a variety of ways this condition may physically manifest including infants that have enlarged clitorises or a combination of elements of both the male and female genitalia. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Sex assignment is often performed on infants that have obvious intersex characteristics, this is often referred to as intersex genital mutilation. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Some have recently suggested that medically unnecessary surgeries such as intersex genital mutilation be delayed until the child is old enough to make a medically informed decision with counseling. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Many intersex individuals may even go their whole lives without knowing that they are intersex due to a chromosomal abnormality.  Typically, females' sex chromosomes are XX and males XY, however, XXY ([[Klinefelter syndrome]]), XXXY, XXXXY, and XYY are some other possibilities. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Pacific Center for Sex and Society - Intersexuality|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2010-intersexuality.html|access-date=2020-12-16|website=www.hawaii.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 === Gender spectrum === 
 Although many societies still exist under a gender binary, more and more around the world are becoming more accepting of ideas of gender outside of strict male and female categories. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|title=One Percent on the Burn Chart: Gender, Genitals, and Hermaphrodites with Attitude|last=Valentine, Wilchins|first=David, Riki Anne|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Duke University|pages=217}} < /ref >  An important thing to know about gender in this form is that the people who exist within them have always existed but have not always been free to express themselves. One example of this is people who are transgender, those who were labeled based on their biological sex, but eventually come to realize that label does not fit what they identify with. In addition to this, some people do not experience gender in a way that fits into a binary at all, and these people are called either [[Non-binary|non binary]] or [[genderqueer]]. 
 
 Another category that is not a part of the gender binary is called intersex. Intersex people are born without obviously male or female [[Sex organ|genitalia]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  It is a common practice in hospitals that an intersex baby will have a surgery that makes them one sex. Doctors do this with the belief it will help the child later on in life as they begin to develop during puberty. However, it can cause mental and emotional issues for the child if they begin to struggle with gender identity. [[Intersexuality]] is not a well accepted or understood idea in most places, since most people have never heard of it or are willing to accept people who are.
