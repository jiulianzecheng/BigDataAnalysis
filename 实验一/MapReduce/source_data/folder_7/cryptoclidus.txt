 '''''Cryptoclidus''''' was a [[plesiosaur]], an aquatic [[reptile]] up to 13 feet (4 m) long. It had curved, interlocking teeth, a wide skull, and large, flexible, [[paddle]]-like flippers. The fragile head and teeth could not deal with large prey. That suggests a diet of small, soft-bodied animals such as [[squid]] and small [[shoaling]] fish. 
 
 ''Cryptoclidus'' fossils have been found in [[England]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and possibly [[South America]]. 
 
 ''Cryptoclidus'' was named by Seeley in 1892. The [[type species]] is ''C. eurymerus''.
