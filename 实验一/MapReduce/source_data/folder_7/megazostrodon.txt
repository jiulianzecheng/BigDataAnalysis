 '''''Megazostrodon''''' is an early proto-[[mammal]],  discovered in [[Lesotho]], southern [[Africa]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://dml.cmnh.org/1999Dec/msg00290.html |title=Dinosaur Mailing List |access-date=2014-05-13 |archive-date=2011-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115213240/http://dml.cmnh.org/1999Dec/msg00290.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > Crompton and Jenkins,  " Molar occlusion in late Triassic mammals " , ''Biological Review'', '''43''' 1968:427-458. < /ref > 
 
 It is one of the first [[mammal]]s, and appeared in the fossil record about 200/205  million years ago (mya). < ref name= " Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins " > [http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/communication/mcgowan/MAMS Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605080907/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/communication/mcgowan/MAMS |date=2011-06-05 }}. Palaeobiology and Biodiversity Research Group, University of Bristol. < /ref >  It did have some non-mammalian characteristics, < ref > the evolution of the [[ear ossicles]] had not reached its modern state < /ref >  but overall this animal, and ''[[Morganucodon]]'', probably show the final stage of the transition between the [[cynodont]]s and true mammals. < ref > {{Cite web |title=''Historical Biology''. 1992, vol. 6 p.186 |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/JOURNALS/pdf/ghbi_06_01_02.pdf |access-date=2014-05-13 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211014/http://www.tandf.co.uk/JOURNALS/pdf/ghbi_06_01_02.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 It is thought that the animal was [[nocturnal]] as it had a relatively much larger brain than its [[cynodont]] relatives, < ref name= " Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins " / >  and the enlarged areas of its brain  were found to be those which process sounds and smells. 
 
 [[Nocturnal]] activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat. < ref name=Kemp > Kemp T.S. 2005. ''The origin and evolution of mammals''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-850760-7}} < /ref > < sup > p124 < /sup > 
 From their size and teeth, ''Megastrozodon'' were probably [[insectivore]]s, as were all its relatives at the time. < ref name=Mike > Benton, Michael J. 2005. ''Vertebrate paleontology''. 3rd ed, Oxford: Blackwell. {{ISBN|0-632-05637-1}} < /ref > < sup > p300 < /sup >  Their small size suggests some kind of [[temperature regulation]], which in turn suggests [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] in the form of [[fur]]. 
 
 The night-time behaviour and insectivorous habits gave these early mammals a [[niche]] which did not compete with the reptiles. < ref > [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976RSPTB.273..387J Smithsonian Science Abstract] < /ref > 
 
 These early mammals developed many [[Trait (biology)|traits]] which made them well-suited for an active lifestyle. They developed four types of teeth. < ref name= " FMA " > [http://www.stellar.co.nz/tl10.html First Mammals Appear] < /ref >  There is evidence that the inward-closing movement of the mandible suggests a shearing action to chew food. < ref > {{cite book|author= Savage R.J.G. and Long M.R.|title= Mammal evolution: an illustrated guide|url= https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni00sava|publisher= Facts On File Inc| year=1986| isbn= 0-8160-1194-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/mammalevolutioni00sava/page/n24 41]}} < /ref >  Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more flexible (they became less laterally splayed, < ref > [http://www.shsu.edu/~bio_mlt/mammals.html Mammalian Characteristics]. Sam Houston State University. < /ref >  allowing for faster forward motion) and they developed a shorter ribcage and larger lungs < ref name= " FMA " / >  to allow for faster [[Respiratory system|respiration]]. The structure of their jaw bones changed, the lower jaw becoming a single bone  & mdash; the [[dentary]]. The other bones which once made up the jaw moved to the middle ear to create a hearing system. < ref name= " Fur and Fangs: Mammal Origins " / >
