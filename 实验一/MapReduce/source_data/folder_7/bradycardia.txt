 '''Bradycardia''' (also called '''bradyarrhythmia''') is a slow [[heart rate]].  In adults, bradycardia is [[wikt:definition|defined]] as a [[heart]] rate that is under 60 beats per minute (bpm) while the person is resting. < ref > {{cite web|title=Types of Arrhythmia|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr/types|access-date=19 March 2015|date=July 1, 2011}} < /ref >   Bradycardia is a type of [[cardiac arrhythmia]]. 
 
 There are many types of bradycardia.  Some are caused by problems with the heart.  Bradycardia can also be caused by [[medication|medicines]], drugs, and many other things. 
 
 ==Symptoms== 
 The [[symptom]]s of bradycardia depend on how slow the heart rate is and what kind of problem the heart is having.  For most people, bradycardia is not a serious problem.  But it can become a serious problem if it signals a major problem with the heart.  Also, if bradycardia gets very bad, the heart will be unable to pump enough blood and oxygen to the body.  Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive.  If bradycardia is bad enough, it can cause [[organ]] damage, [[brain damage]], and [[death]]. < ref name= " merck " > {{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch075/ch075a.html|title=Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders|date=January 2008|work=The merck Manuals: Online Medical Library|publisher=Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp|access-date=16 December 2009|archive-date=7 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207021516/http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch075/ch075a.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Causes== 
 * Problems with the heart's electrical system.  There are two atria (upper [[wikt: chamber|chambers]]) in the heart: the right atrium and the left atrium.  For the heart to beat normally, [[Heart#Heart's pacemaker|special parts of the right atrium]] have to send [[electricity]] through the heart to make it squeeze out blood.  The electricity has to start in a certain place and pass through a certain route in the heart.  If this does not happen correctly, the heart will not beat correctly. 
 * Medications, like [[beta blocker]]s 
 * [[Depressant]] medications or drugs
