 A '''hectosecond''' is equal to 100 [[second]]s. It can be written as '''10 < sup > 2 < /sup >  seconds'''. There are ten hectoseconds in one [[kilosecond]], which is one thousand seconds. There are ten [[decasecond]]s in one hectosecond. There are 864 hectoseconds in one day (24 hours). 
 
 * 1 hectosecond  -  1 minute 40 seconds 
 * 1.02 hectoseconds  -  [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of [[nobelium]]-253 
 * 1.2–1.8 hectoseconds = 2–3 minutes  -  normal time for cooking [[instant noodles]] or for boiling an [[egg (food)|egg]] 
 * 3.15 hectoseconds = 5.25 minutes after the [[Big Bang]]  -  the first [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] form 
 * 5 hectoseconds = 8.333... minutes  -  amount of time it takes [[light]] to travel between the [[earth]] and the [[sun]] 
 * 8.86 hectoseconds  -  [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of a [[free neutron]] 
 * 10 hectoseconds  -  about 16.7 [[minute]]s
