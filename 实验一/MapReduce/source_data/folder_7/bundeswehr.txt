 }} 
 The '''Bundeswehr''' ([[German language|German]] for  " Federal Defence Force " ; {{Audio|De-Bundeswehr2.ogg| < small > listen < /small > }}) are the German Armed Forces. The German armed forces are for the unified Germany itself and do not have several parts for the [[States of Germany]]. 
 
 There are five sections: three bigger ones: [[German Army|Heer]] (Army), [[German Navy|Marine]] (Navy) and [[Luftwaffe]] (Air Force) form one unified force, not three separate fighting forces. And two smaller ones: ''Joint Support Service'' ([[Streitkräftebasis]]) and ''Central Medical Services'' ([[Zentraler Sanitätsdienst]]). 
 
 In peace-time the commander-in-chief is the [[Ministry of Defence of Germany|Federal Minister of Defence]], and in wartime the [[Chancellor of Germany]]. This is unlike most countries where the head of state is commander in chief. 
 
 In March 2012, there were about 207,000 soldiers serving in the Bundeswehr; there are another 200,000 in reserve. [[Conscription]] for the Bundeswehr has been abolished in July 2011.
