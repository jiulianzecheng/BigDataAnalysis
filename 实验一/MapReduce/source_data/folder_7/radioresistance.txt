'''Radioresistance''' is a property of some living things. It means they can resist the effects of [[gamma radiation]], [[ultra-violet radiation]], and similar types of [[radiation]]. A good example is the [[bacterium]] ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]''. It has [[enzymes]] which repair the [[DNA]] strands which have been split by the radiation. < ref name=Sarah > DeWeerdt, Sarah The worldâ€™s toughest bacterium.
