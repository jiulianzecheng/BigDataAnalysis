'''Harass''' or '''harassment''' is when a person annoys or upsets someone else, usually repetitively. It is done on purpose and makes the target feel scared, worried or sick from fear. These are behaviors that appear to be disturbing, upsetting or threatening. 
 
 There are a lot of types of harassment: [[bullying]] at school or by [[neighbor]]s, [[sexual harassment]] at work or when someone borrowed money, or racial and religious [[discrimination]]. There are laws against harassment in many countries, and employers now have a duty to protect employees from harassment. < ref > Protection from Harassment Act 1997. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/40 (downloaded 31 Dec 2010) < /ref >
