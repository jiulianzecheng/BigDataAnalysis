'''Leg irons''', '''leg cuffs''' or '''refers''' are restraining devices for the [[leg]]s. They are like [[handcuffs]] and are usually designed and built with a longer [[chain]] that allows [[walking]], but prevents [[running]] and [[kicking]]. Leg irons are usually put on a prisoner when he or she goes to [[court]] or works on a [[chain gang]].
