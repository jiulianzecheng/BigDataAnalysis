 An '''orchard''' is where [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s that produce [[food]] are grown.  [[Fruit]], [[nuts]], and [[vegetables]] are grown in orchards.  They are grown to be sold. Orchards are sometimes a part of large [[garden]]s. They are put there to look nice and to produce food. < ref > {{cite book|title=Practical Orchard Plans and Methods: How to Begin and Carry on the Work |author= Luther Burbank|publisher=The Minerva Group|isbn=1-4147-0141-1}} < /ref >
