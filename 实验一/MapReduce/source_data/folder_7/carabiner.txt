 A '''carabiner''' is a [[metal]] [[loop]], which can be opened on one side. This side is called a [[gate]]. The other side is called [[spine]]. Carabiners are often used for [[rock climbing]], [[sailing]] and [[canoeing]]. They also are used for [[construction]] of high buildings or [[window]] cleaning.  The word comes from the [[German language|German]] [[word]]  " ''Karabinerhaken'' " , which means  " [[hook]] for a [[carbine]] " .  
 
 Climbing carabiners are very strong. Many can hold loads greater than 20 [[kilonewton|kN]]. When [[belaying]] a climber, using a belay device (such as a [[Grigri]] or an ATC), a carabiner with a locking feature must be used to prevent the carabiner from opening accidentally. 
 
 ==Different types==

 *'''HMS''': A special kind of carabiner is often used in [[rock climbing]]. HMS = HeMi Spherical. i.e. offset, or curved to one side.  HMS is also considered short for the [[German language|German]] word,  " Halbmastwurfsicherung " , a knot which is called the [[Munter Hitch]] in English. The special offset shape of the HMS carabiner allows a climber to use the Munter Hitch for belaying without the rope getting stuck or jammed. 
 *'''D-shape''': This type of carabiner sends most of the load to the spine side. This makes the carabiner stronger, but more expensive. Big D-shape carabiners are called ''Offset-D'' 
 *'''Oval''': This type is the cheapest. They are often used in [[aid climbing]] or for organizing (racking) gear. They are usually not as strong as the other types of carabiners. 
 
 The last two types exist with and without locking devices. HMS carabiners usually are not produced without locking device. Non-locking-carabiners are often used in [[quickdraw]]s.
