 An '''antitoxin''' is an [[antibody]] that can neutralize a specific [[toxin]] (or poison).  Certain [[Plant|plants]], [[Animal|animals]], and [[bacteria]] produce them, when they are exposed to a toxin. Antitoxins can also be injected into another [[organism]], as a treatment against an [[infectious disease]]. To produce an antitoxin, a safe dose of a toxin is injected into an animal. The animal will then produce an antitoxin. Later, [[blood]] is taken from the animal, and the antitoxin is extracted from it. It will be purified, and can be used.
