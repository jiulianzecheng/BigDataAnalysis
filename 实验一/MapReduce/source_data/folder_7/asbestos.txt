 '''Asbestos''' is a set of six [[silicate]] [[mineral]]s which occur naturally. [[White asbestos]] makes up 95% of the asbestos found in buildings. It occurs in all parts of the world. It is fibrous, heat resistant and non flammable. These properties made it very attractive as a component in building materials and other products such as insulation and automobile brake pads. People have used asbestos throughout history. Ancient [[Egypt]]ian people used asbestos. Asbestos is extremely dangerous for human health, as it can cause [[lung]] [[disease]]s such as [[asbestosis]], [[emphysema]] and [[mesothelioma]] if the fibres get loose in the air. It can also harm animals such as livestock or pets. 
 
 Asbestos was linked to [[lung cancer]] in the early 1970s, < ref name=hamptonroads > Burke, Bill (6 May 2001) [http://www.asbestos-attorney.com/pilot3-1.htm  " Shipyards, a Crucible for Tragedy: Part 1: How the war created a monster " ] ''Virginian-Pilot'' Norfolk, Virginia (newspaper) < /ref >  and was replaced by other materials in most applications by 1980. 
 
 == Types of asbestos == 
 There are six types of asbestos: 
 
 *[[White asbestos|Chrysotile (white asbestos)]] 
 *[[Blue asbestos|Crocidolite (blue asbestos)]] 
 *[[Brown asbestos|Amosite (brown asbestos)]] 
 *[[Anthophyllite asbestos]] 
 *[[Tremolite asbestos]] 
 *[[Actinolite asbestos]] 
 
 == Substitutes == 
 * [[Fiberglass]] - This is the most popular substitute. Fiberglass is physically similar to asbestos and its safety is also being questioned. Fiberglass has been called  " man-made asbestos " . 
 * [[Carbon fiber]] - Lighter weight than fiberglass or asbestos, but not heat resistant 
 * [[Wood]] fiber mixed with [[cement]] (in non-heat applications) 
 * Various [[polymer]] and [[plastic]] fibers 
 * Asbestos rope can be replaced with synthetic or fiberglass rope. 
 * [[Vermiculite]] insulation is a common substitute, although vermiculite itself can be contaminated with asbestos 
 * [[Basalt]] fiber is a mineral fiber with properties similar to asbestos. It is suitable for high-heat applications. 
 * [[Mineral wool]] is a common substitute that is popular in Europe 
 * Silica [[aerogel]] is the best insulator available. It is non-fibrous and is not believed to cause cancer if inhaled into the lungs. 
 
 == Lawsuits == 
 Many companies that use or used to use asbestos have been sued by current or former employees who got sick with [[mesothelioma]] or [[asbestosis]]. Many lawyers specialize in asbestos-related [[lawsuit]]s.
