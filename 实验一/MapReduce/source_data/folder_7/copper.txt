 '''Copper''' is a [[chemical element]]. It is the 29th element in the [[periodic table]]. Its [[atomic weight]] is 63.55. It is a [[transition metal]] in the middle of the periodic table. The symbol for copper is  " Cu " , which comes from the [[Latin]] word ''cuprum'', which, in turn, came from the Latin word for the island of [[Cyprus]], where copper was found.  < ref > {{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Cu|title=29.

 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 [[File:Cu-Scheibe.JPG|thumb|Copper disc, acid etched, you see the normally invisible crystalline structure]] 
 
 Copper is a reddish-orange color when it is pure, but soon gets a reddish [[tarnish]] after it is exposed to air.  
 
 Copper is one of the few coloured metals. Most metals are gray or silver. [[Gold]], copper, [[caesium]] and [[osmium]] are the only four coloured metals. It is [[magnet]]ic. Copper is green as [[copper(II) carbonate]] and [[copper(II) hydroxide]]. It turns green because it oxidizes. After a time in the air, copper forms green copper carbonate at the surface, called [[verdigris]]. That is why the copper roof of a building looks green. 
 
 Copper is very flexible and [[wikt:ductile|ductile]]. It can be stretched into wires easily. Copper is also very soft, it has a [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] of 2.5 to 3. That means that it is harder than a fingernail but softer than a steel pocketknife.  
 
 It reacts with solutions of [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[ammonia]] containing [[oxygen]]. It can also dissolve in a mixture of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]. This makes [[copper(II) chloride]]. It does not dissolve in weak acids. It can dissolve in [[nitric acid]] to make [[copper(II) nitrate]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] or [[nitric oxide]]. 
 
 ===Compounds=== 
 Copper forms chemical compounds. In these compounds, it has two normal [[oxidation state]]s: +1 and +2. +2 is more common. Most +2 copper compounds are blue. +1 copper compounds can be white. Copper compounds are weak [[oxidizing agent]]s. They corrode many metals. This corrosion takes the metal and puts it in the chemical compound, leaving the copper behind. An example would be [[iron]] and [[copper(II) sulfate]] reacting to make copper and [[iron(II) sulfate]]. +1 copper compounds are [[reducing agent]]s when in air. They are normally made by [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of +2 compounds. 
 
 Copper compounds can be [[copper(II) oxide|black]], [[copper(II) chloride|green]], [[copper(I) oxide|reddish]], [[copper(I) chloride|white]], [[copper sulfate|blue]], or yellow. 
 
 ====Copper(I) compounds==== 
 Copper(I) compounds have copper in +1 oxidation state. They are weak [[reducing agent]]s. They react with air to make copper(II) compounds. They also [[disproportionation|disproportionate]] to copper and copper(II) compounds. Most of them do not dissolve in water. 
 *[[Copper(I) acetylide]], reddish brown, explosive 
 *[[Copper(I) bromide]] 
 *[[Copper(I) chloride]], white when pure, green when [[oxidation|oxidized]] 
 *[[Copper(I) iodide]], colorless solid 
 *[[Copper(I) oxide]], reddish-brown 
 
 ====Copper(II) compounds==== 
 Copper(II) compounds have copper in +2 oxidation state. They are weak [[oxidizing agent]]s. They are greenish when hydrous (water molecules added). They are more [[wikt:stable|stable]] in air than copper(I) compounds. 
 *[[Copper(II) bromide]], gray solid 
 *[[Copper(II) carbonate]], greenish, forms on copper when in air 
 *[[Copper(II) chloride]], greenish when hydrous, brown when anhydrous 
 *[[Copper(II) hydroxide]], light blue, turns into copper(II) carbonate easily 
 *[[Copper(II) nitrate]], blue, oxidizing agent, used in [[wikt:demonstration|demonstration]] [[voltaic cell]]s 
 *[[Copper(II) oxide]], black 
 *[[Copper(II) sulfate]], blue, most common copper compound 
 *[[Paris Green]], extremely toxic, bright blue-green

 ==Occurrence== 
 [[File:Copper-tmu21a.jpg|thumb|100px|Copper as a metal in the ground]] 
 [[File:Min chalcopyrite.jpg|thumb|Chalcopyrite]] 
 Copper can be found as a metal in the ground. Normally, it is green on the outside. Most copper is not as a metal but in chemical compounds. [[Chalcopyrite]] is the most common copper [[ore]]. It is a mixture of [[pyrite]] and [[copper sulfide]]. Copper is found in small amounts in living things. Some [[mollusk]]s and [[arthropod]]s have blue blood because they have copper in their blood. Animals such as humans and other mammals have red blood because it contains iron. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Copper can be used in many ways but one example is wires. Copper is used in making wires as it is easy to stretch and it is not expensive. So thatâ€™s why large wire companies will use copper as it is cheaper and takes less time to get 
 
 Copper may be the oldest metal in use, as very old copper tools have been found. Copper is used in electrical wiring. It can also be shaped into various parts. It can be used in a [[wikt:heatsink|heat sink]]. The [[Statue of Liberty]] is made of copper. It is also used in pipes carrying water, because it does not [[corrosion|corrode]]. 
 
 When people mix copper with [[tin]], [[bronze]] is made. Bronze is much harder, and created the [[Bronze Age]]. It became less important when people learned to use [[iron]] better. When [[zinc]] is mixed with copper, [[brass]] is made, which is even harder than bronze. Copper with nickel makes [[cupronickel]]. 
 
 Copper is also used in medical and food production industries. Copper can alter proteins, form radicals, and disrupt enzymes, thereby inactivating or killing bacteria and viruses. < ref > {{Cite web|date=27 March 2020|title=Use of Copper to Microbe-proof Medical and Restaurant Equipment|url=https://vrcmetalsystems.com/microbe-proof-medical-restaurant-equipment/|access-date=2021-07-31|website=vrcmetalsystems.com|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Copper is an easily molded base metal that is often added to precious metals to improve their elasticity, flexibility, hardness, color, and resistance to corrosion. 
 
 ===As chemical compounds=== 
 Copper is important in the human body. If a person does not get enough copper, the [[molecule]]s in the body might not work. Having too much copper, though, can be a problem. Humans get most of the copper they need from food, and [[vitamin]]s also contain copper to make sure we get enough. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2017-10-23|title=Copper: Health benefits, recommended intake, sources, and risks|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/288165|access-date=2021-07-31|website=www.medicalnewstoday.com|language=en}} < /ref >  Copper compounds are also used to kill [[fungi]] and [[algae]]. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 Copper is not as toxic as a metal. Copper compounds are toxic, although small amounts are needed to live. Copper is expelled from the body easily, so it does not build up in toxic effects. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 Copper is sometimes just taken out of the ground and shaped into objects. But most copper is not in a metal form in the ground. Chalcopyrite is the main copper ore. It is heated with air to separate the iron as [[iron(II) oxide]]. Some copper(I) oxide is made. [[Sulfur dioxide]] is also made. Then [[silicon dioxide]] is added, which reacts with the iron(II) oxide to make a liquid which is drained. Now only copper and [[sulfide]] are left. The copper sulfide reacts with air to make copper metal and sulfur dioxide. Some copper sulfide reacts with the copper(I) oxide to make copper and sulfur dioxide. This makes impure copper. 
 
 Copper is made pure by [[electrolysis|electrolyzing]] it. A thin sheet of pure copper is put on the [[cathode]] and a thick sheet of impure copper is put on the [[anode]]. The [[electrolyte]] is [[copper sulfate]]. The impure copper gets dissolved in the solution. It then coats the thin sheet of pure copper. This makes the copper pure. 
 
 Large amounts of copper are recycled because of its high value and the increasing depletion of worldwide copper reserves.
