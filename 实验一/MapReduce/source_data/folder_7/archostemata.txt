 '''Archostemata''' is the smallest [[suborder]] of [[beetle]]s. There are less than fifty known [[species]]. 
 
 Archostemata is an ancient lineage with a number of [[basal|primitive]] characteristics.  They are similar to the first beetles, which appear in the fossil record about 250 million years ago. The suborder contains the only [[Neoteny|paedogenic]] beetles, ''Micromalthus debilis''. 
 
 These beetles are rare. Fossil deposits from the [[Permian]] suggest that Archostemata were once much more common and were widespread over the globe. The species which remain are just scattered vestiges of their former population.
