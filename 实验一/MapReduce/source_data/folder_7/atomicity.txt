Modern [[database]] systems are governed by the [[ACID]] principle. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-07-02|title=What are the ACID properties? {{!}} Data Basecamp|url=https://databasecamp.de/en/data/acids|access-date=2022-07-07|language=en-US}} < /ref >  In that context, several operations can be grouped into what is called a transaction. From the outside, there are two points in time: before the transaction, and after the transaction. If one operation of this transaction fails, the whole [[transaction]] will. In other words: Either all the operations are done, or none is. An example of an atomic transaction is a monetary transfer from bank account A to account B.
