 '''Tiziano Vecellio''' (sometimes his last name is given as ''Vecelli'', born around 1490, < ref > No exact date is known. The accepted view today is either 1488 or 1490. Other versions include dates around 1477. [[Giorgione]] (1477-1510) was another Renaissance painter. Some people believe, Giorgione painted some of Titian's early works. < /ref >  in [[Pieve di Cadore]] near [[Belluno]],  died 27 August 1576 < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tita/hd_tita.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=30 January 2011}} < /ref >  in [[Venice]]) was an Italian [[painter]]. His name in English is '''Titian'''. He was one of the leading painters of the 16th century Venetian school; he is also seen as one of the principal artists of High [[Renaissance]] painting of the [[16th century]]. When he was alive, he was often called ''Da Cadore'', after his place of birth. 
 
 When he was active, the [[Republic of Venice]] had a [[Golden Age]], and was well-off economically. Aged nine, Titian went to Venice. The brothers [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]] taught him how to paint. In 1513, he opened his own shop, and developed into a successful painter, known all over Europe. In 1533, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] made him a [[Nobility|nobleman]]. He also obtained a job as a painter at the court of Charles V.  In 1545, [[Pope Paul III]] invited him to come to [[Rome]], in 1548 and 1550, Titian accompanied Charles V and his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. When Titian died of the [[Plague]] in the year 1576, he was an old man. He was also one of the most famous painters of Venetian history. 
 
 Titian was very productive: in total, he painted 676 works. He did [[portrait]]s, [[landscape]]s, as well as themes from [[mythology]] and [[religion|religious works]]. All his works are very colorful. This special use of color influenced other painters of the same period a great deal. His works influenced painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]].

 File:Titian - Portrait of a man with a quilted sleeve.jpg|A self-portrait, done around 1510. For a long time, it was attributed to  [[Ariosto]]. [[Rembrandt]]  also used this composition for his self-portraits. 
 File:Titian-salome.jpg|[[Salome]], or [[Judith]]; this also shows an idealized portrait of beauty, which Titian developed. Titian often used Venetian [[courtesan]]s as models. 
 File:Tizian 012.jpg|This painting, called ''[[Danaë]] with Nursemaid'' is one of several he did with a mythological theme, for Philip II of Spain. It shows how well he could handle colour.  Even though [[Michelangelo]] thought the drawing was lacking, Titian produced several versions for other patrons. 
 File:Tizian 085.jpg|''The Rape of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]'' (1562) was admired and copied by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. In contrast to the clarity of Titian's early works, it is almost [[baroque]] in its blurred lines, swirling colors, and vibrant brushstrokes.
