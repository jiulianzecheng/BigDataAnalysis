'''ECMAScript''' is a standard made for the [[JavaScript]] [[scripting language]]. It was created for [[JavaScript]] to run the same on all browsers, since different ones used different versions of JavaScript. 
 
 In November 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of [[Ecma International]] to standardize [[JavaScript]]. [[Microsoft]] critcised this decision, since they were leading in the JavaScript war with their [[Internet Explorer]] browser.
