 '''Nomadic people''' (or '''nomads''') are people who move from one place to another, instead of living in one place. The best known examples in Europe are [[gypsy|gypsies]], [[Roma people|Roma]], [[Sinti]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] travelers. Many other [[ethnic group]]s and [[Community|communities]] are [[tradition]]ally nomadic; such as [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Kazakh]]s, and [[Bedouin]]. 
 
 People are nomads for many reasons. Most nomads are family men herding their livestock, such as [[cattle]], or [[horse]]s from [[pasture]] to pasture. These people have to change places because of the [[weather]]. Other nomads are traders and craftsmen (people who make things), traveling to exchange goods or to practice their craft where it is needed. 
 
 Nomads who follow their herds usually live in [[tent]]s with few things inside, like the [[Mongol]]s. Nomads who trade or practice crafts usually have wagons in which they travel, because wagons are better for carrying goods. 
 
 The [[SÃ¡mi]] of [[Lapland]] are semi-nomadic tribe following a herd of [[reindeer]]. They are a [[migration|migratory]] people who lead their own herd of reindeer to [[winter]] feeding grounds and then return them in the [[spring]] to their feeding ground close to a [[permanent]] home base, where their family lives. This cycle happens every year.   
 
 The skills of nomadic life can also be useful in mobile warfare, and have been used in attacking sedentary agricultural and urban people. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongol]] hordes, for example conquered vast areas in Asia by organizing themselves as [[cavalry]]. < ref > Kradin, Nikolay N. 2003. Nomadic Empires: origins, rise, decline.
