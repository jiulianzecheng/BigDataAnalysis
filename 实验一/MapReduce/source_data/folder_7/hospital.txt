 A '''hospital''' is a place where a person goes to be healed when he or she is sick or injured. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What does HOSPITAL mean?|url=https://www.definitions.net/definition/HOSPITAL|access-date=2021-06-23|website=www.definitions.net}} < /ref >  The difference between a hospital and other healthcare places like a [[clinic]] or a doctor's office is that a hospital will have beds where patients can stay overnight. These patients are called ''inpatients''. The goal of inpatient treatment is to provide 24-7 medical stabilization, which is why this type of treatment has more of a hospital-like feel since patients are monitored by doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers. Treatment is structured and has a schedule that can include individual therapy, group therapy, case management, and support groups. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What Is Inpatient Treatment?|url=https://addiction-treatment.com/treatment/inpatient-residential/|access-date=2021-06-23|website=}} < /ref >
