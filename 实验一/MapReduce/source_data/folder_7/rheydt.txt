 '''Rheydt''' is a [[borough]] of the city of [[Mönchengladbach]], [[Germany]]. It lies in the very west of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].  
 
 The first written mention of the town is in 1180. From 1918 until 1933 it was part of the city of Mönchengladbach. Dr. [[Joseph Goebbels]], who was born in Rheydt, arranged for the city to get back its independence. It is a town with many factories, mainly silk and textiles. It was bombed heavily during [[World War II]]. In 1975 it again became part of Mönchengladbach. The central station, [[Rheydt Hauptbahnhof]], kept its original name, which makes Mönchengladbach the only city in Germany to have two stations called [[Hauptbahnhof]]. 
 
 [[Schloss Rheydt]], one of the best preserved [[palace]]s of the [[Renaissance]] period, is located in Rheydt.
