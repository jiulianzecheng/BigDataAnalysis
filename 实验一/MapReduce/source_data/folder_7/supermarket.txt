 A '''supermarket''', '''grocery store''' (or just '''grocery''') is a retail [[Shop|store]] that sells [[food]]. Most grocery stores sell fresh [[fruit]], [[vegetables]], [[seafood]], [[meat]], and other prepared foods. 
 
 The person who controls a grocery store is called a [[grocer]].  A grocer will order food from [[farmer]]s or other people who send out farmers food to other grocery stores and [[restaurants]]. 
 
 ==Types of grocery stores== 
 There are a range of different types and sizes of grocery stores.  Some grocery stores are small community stores with a limited range of items.  Other grocery stores are large, with a wide selection of food items.  
 They may also sell household [[cleaning]] and [[laundry]] supplies, and hygiene items (soap, toothpaste, etc.). They may also contain a [[pharmacy]] (known as a drug store or chemist in some places). 
 
 Items at a grocery store can be sold in one of two ways. Most fruits, vegetables, meat, and seafood are usually sold by [[weight]] (for example, apples cost 99 cents per [[Pound (mass)|pound]]), while other items are usually sold by [[quantity]] (for example, [[table salt]] costs $1.59 for each box). Not all items are the same price at each grocery store. Also, every week, some items at grocery stores cost less that what it normally would cost (we say that these items are  " on sale " ), so people would want to go buy them since they don't have to pay as much as they would normally have to get that item. Many grocery stores print a [[Pamphlet|flyer]] that shows which items are on sale that week. These flyers are then sent to other people in the [[mail]], who would read the flyer and go to the store to buy the items shown in it.

 ===Supermarkets=== 
 '''Supermarkets''' are large grocery stores that sell a large variety of fresh and packaged food and other consumer or household products. Supermarkets are divided into sections, such as [[bakery]], [[Dairy product|dairy]], [[produce]] (fruits and vegetables), [[Frozen food|frozen]], meat, and [[Delicatessen|deli]], along with a  " general grocery "  section where one can find packaged goods, cleaning supplies, and personal [[hygiene]] items. Many supermarkets today now also sell hot, prepared food that is ready to eat, or contains a [[food court]] with different [[fast food]] shops. The term  " supermarket "  usually refers to a larger store than the term  " grocery store. "

 ===Hypermarkets=== 
 A '''hypermarket''' is a very large supermarket that is part of a larger general [[merchandise]] store such as [[Walmart]], which also sells [[clothes]], [[electronics]], household hardware, and other items. It can be said to be a [[hybrid]] (or [[combination]]) of a grocery store and a [[department store]]. These stores are mainly found in [[suburb]]s where there is a lot of room to build and near where people live. 
 
 == How to shop at a grocery store == 
 [[File:1909groceryVancouverWA.png|left|thumb|This small  " dry grocery "  of the early 20th century did not sell wet things such as beverages or sauces]] 
 Until the [[20th century]], grocery stores were small.  The owner, called a [[shopkeeper]], would ask the [[wikt:customer|customer]] what he or she would like to buy.  The shopkeeper would then get the items, bring it to the customer, and put them in [[bag]]s which the customer would take with them.  He would then [[wikt:calculate|calculate]] how much the customer has to [[Payment|pay]], and take the [[money]] from the customer.  The customer then took the bags of items out of the store by him/herself. 
 
 Today, most groceries stores are too big for one person to take care of.  Because of this, customers must find the items they wants by themselves.  Most often, the customer takes a shopping [[basket]] or [[shopping cart]] and put the items into the basket or cart.  For some items, like meat and seafood, the customer still has to have an [[employee]] get or prepare the item.  When customers have finished selecting, they bring the items to the  " checkout " , where a person called a [[cashier]] scans the customer's items into a [[cash register]] (or a [[computer]] as part of a [[point of sale]] system) and then takes the customer's payment.  Supermarkets typically accept payment by [[cash]], [[debit card]]s, and/or [[credit card]]s.  In the [[21st century]], there are so-called [[self-checkout]] systems where customers scan the items themselves. 
 
 Many large supermarkets also have a [[loyalty program]], where a customer can earn points by purchasing products. When a customer has enough points, a [[discount]] or reward is given. These programs are meant to make customers come back to the same store again and again.
