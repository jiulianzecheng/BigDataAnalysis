In [[linguistics]], a '''participle''' is a word that shares some characteristics of both [[verb]]s and [[adjective]]s. < ref > [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAParticiple.htm What is a participle?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212084711/http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAParticiple.htm |date=2013-02-12 }} in [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Index.htm Glossary of linguistic terms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210081627/http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/index.htm |date=2013-02-10 }} at SIL International. < /ref >  Examples of participle formation are: 
 {|class= " wikitable " 
 | < br > '''Verb'''||Past < br > Simple||Past < br > Participle||Present < br > Participle||Regular/ < br > Irregular 
 |- 
 |to '''hire''' 
 |colspan= " 2 "  align= " center " |hir''ed''||hir''ing''|| regular 
 |- 
 |to '''do'''||did||done||do''ing'' 
 |rowspan= " 7 " |irregular 
 |- 
 |to '''say''' 
 |colspan= " 2 "  align= " center " |said||say''ing'' 
 |- 
 |to '''eat'''||ate||eat''en''||eat''ing'' 
 |- 
 |to '''write'''||wrote||writt''en''||writ''ing'' 
 |- 
 |to '''beat'''||beat||beat''en''||beat''ing'' 
 |- 
 |to '''sing'''||sang||sung||sing''ing'' 
 |- 
 |to '''see'''||saw||seen||see''ing'' 
 |} 
 As noun-modifiers, participles usually precede the noun (like [[adjective]]s), but in many cases they can or must follow it: 
 *''The '''visiting''' dignitaries devoured the '''baked''' apples.'' 
 *''Please bring all the documents '''required'''.'' (= ''Please bring all the documents '''that are required'''''.) 
 *''The difficulties '''encountered''' were nearly insurmountable.'' (= ''The difficulties '''that were encountered''' were nearly insurmountable.'') 
 
 == Present participles == 
 The present participle in English has the same form as the [[gerund]], but the gerund acts as a noun rather than a verb or a modifier. The word ''sleeping'' in ''Your job description does not include '''sleeping''''' is a gerund and not a present participle. 
 
 While English past participles, like [[past tense]] forms, are sometimes [[English irregular verbs|irregular]], all English present participles are regular, being formed with the suffix ''-ing''. 
 The present participle in English is in the active voice and is used for:  
 *forming the [[progressive aspect]]: ''Jim was '''sleeping'''.'' < ref > progressive aspect = ''continuing'' < /ref > 
 *modifying a noun as an adjective: ''Let '''sleeping''' dogs lie.'' (= ''Let dogs '''that are sleeping''' lie.'') 
 *modifying a verb or sentence in clauses: ''Broadly '''speaking''', the project was successful.'' 
 
 == Past participles == 
 The past participle may be used in both active and passive voices: 
 *forming the [[Perfect_(grammar)|perfect]]: ''The chicken has '''eaten'''.'' 
 *forming the [[passive voice]]: ''The chicken was '''eaten'''.'' 
 *modifying a noun, with active sense: ''our '''fallen''' comrades'' (= ''our comrades '''who have fallen''''') 
 *modifying a noun, with passive sense: ''the '''attached''' files'' (= ''the files '''that have been attached''''') 
 *modifying a verb or sentence, with passive sense: '''''Seen''' from this perspective, the problem presents no easy solution.'' (= '''''When it is seen''' from this perspective,....'') 
 
 === Passive participles === 
 Passive participles reflect past action in the [[passive voice]], for example 
 *''The dog, having been '''praised''' by its master, was happy'', or more commonly, ''The dog, '''praised''' by its master, was happy''. 
 
 
 Even irregular past participle verbs often follow the format ''-en'' or ''-ne'', as may be seen from above.  For examples: 
 {|class= " wikitable " 
 | < br > '''Verb'''||Past < br > Participle 
 |- 
 |to '''beat'''||beat''en'' 
 |- 
 |to '''do'''||do''ne'' 
 |- 
 |to '''eat'''||eat''en'' 
 |- 
 |to '''fall'''||fall''en'' 
 |- 
 |to '''give'''||giv''en'' 
 |- 
 |to '''help'''||holp''en''  < ref > Archaic form in early Modern English, used in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' version of the [[Magnificat]], see ''e.g.'', [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Luke-1-54/ King James Bible online].  Accessed September 27, 2010. < /ref >
