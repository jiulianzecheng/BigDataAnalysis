 '''Phosphorus''' has the [[chemical symbol]] '''P''', and its [[atomic number]] is 15. Its [[mass number]] is 30.97. It is not found in nature as an element, but as compounds, such as [[phosphates]]. There are many different forms. The most common form is a red or white waxy solid. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 Phosphorus comes in several forms. White and red phosphorus are the most common forms. White phosphorus is a waxy white [[solid]]. When pure, it is colourless. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in carbon disulfide, an [[organic compound|organic]] [[solvent]]. It turns light yellow when in air. It glows in the dark because it  " burns "  very slowly in air. 
 
 When exposed to sunlight, or when heated in its own vapour to 250 & nbsp;°C, it is converted to the red variety. This form does not ignite spontaneously and it is less toxic and less flammable than white phosphorus. The red modification is fairly stable and sublimes with a vapor pressure of 1 atmosphere at 417 & nbsp;°C. 
 
 ===Chemical properties=== 
 White phosphorus is more reactive than red phosphorus. White phosphorus catches [[fire]] spontaneously in [[air]], burning to make smoke of [[phosphorus(V) oxide]]. If it burns in a little air, it produces poisonous [[phosphorus(III) oxide]]. When white phosphorus is heated in an [[alkali]], it [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to produce [[hypophosphite]]s and [[phosphine]]. Red phosphorus can burn but needs to be ignited. Phosphorus reacts with the [[halogen]]s to make phosphorus [[halide]]s. It reacts with some [[metal]]s to make [[phosphide]]s. 
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 Phosphorus compounds are [[chemical compound]]s containing phosphorus. They are listed below with some of their properties. Phosphorus comes in several [[oxidation state]]s, the number of electrons moved during a [[redox]] reaction. -3 is flammable, powerful reducing agent, and toxic; +1 is a strong [[reducing agent]] and is rare; +3 is a weaker reducing agent that is poisonous; +5 is not a reducing agent and is very common. 
 
 ====In -3 oxidation state==== 
 =====Phosphides===== 
 *[[Phosphine]], toxic gas that smells like fish and ignites by itself 
 *[[Phosphide]], the ion 
 *[[Sodium phosphide]] 
 
 =====Other compounds===== 
 *[[Phosphonium]], another ion 
 
 ====In +1 oxidation state==== 
 *[[Hypophosphorous acid]], salts are called [[hypophosphite]]s 
 *[[Sodium hypophosphite]] 
 
 ====In +3 oxidation state==== 
 ====Phosphites==== 
 *[[Phosphorous acid]], poisonous, salts are called [[phosphite]]s 
 *[[Sodium phosphite]] 
 
 =====Other compounds===== 
 *[[Phosphorus trichloride]] 
 *[[Phosphorus(III) iodide]] 
 *[[Phosphorus(III) oxide]], phosphorus trioxide, poisonous, garlic-smelling 
 
 ====In +5 oxidation state==== 
 =====Phosphates===== 
 *[[Phosphoric acid]], most common, salts are called  phosphates 
 *[[Calcium phosphate]] 
 *[[Dicalcium phosphate]] 
 *[[Mono-calcium phosphate]] 
 *[[Sodium phosphate]] 
 *[[Zinc phosphate]] 
 
 =====Other compounds===== 
 *[[Phosphorus (V) oxide]], phosphorus pentoxide, absorbs water 
 *[[Phosphorus (V) chloride]]

 ==Occurrence== 
 It is an essential component of living systems and is found as phosphate in nervous tissue, [[bone]]s and [[cell]] protoplasm. It is also found in the earth as phosphate rock. Phosphate rock is the main source of phosphorus and phosphorus compounds. Many body tissues have [[calcium phosphate]]s in them. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 Phosphorus was first made by heating a mixture of phosphates and [[carbon]] in an iron pot. The phosphates were made by dissolving bones in strong [[acid]]s and evaporating the solution. 
 
 Phosphorus is made now by heating calcium phosphate, carbon, and [[silicon dioxide]] in an [[electric arc]] furnace. The heat of the electric arc melts the mixture of materials, and phosphorus gas is given off. It is absorbed under water. This makes white phosphorus. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 ===As an element=== 
 White phosphorus is used in [[incendiary device|incendiary]] weapons and [[smoke grenade]]s. It is also used to make organic compounds that have phosphorus in them. Phosphorus is used to [[Doping (semiconductor)|dope]] [[semiconductor]]s. Phosphorus is used to remove oxygen from copper. It is also used in making alloys. Red phosphorus is used in matches and flares. 
 
 ===As chemical compounds=== 
 Phosphorus compounds are used for fertilizers, soft drinks, toothpaste, and detergents. Most of these are phosphates. Phosphides can be used to kill [[rodent]]s. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 White phosphorus is very dangerous. It is very toxic and ignites easily, burning with a very hot flame. Red phosphorus is much safer. Some phosphorus compounds are toxic, but the common phosphates are not toxic.
