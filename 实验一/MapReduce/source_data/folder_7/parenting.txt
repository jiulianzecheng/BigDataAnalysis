'''Parenting''' is the process of helping a [[child]] develop into an [[adult]].   
 
 When a child is an [[infant]], parenting involves providing [[food]], [[comfort]] and [[cleaning]], and allowing the infant to [[sleep]].  As infants cannot [[talk]], this requires the parents to watch the child closely and to help the child learn [[language]]. 
 
 As the [[infant]] grows, parenting involves guiding and teaching the child.  Parents establish [[habit]]s such as brushing teeth and teach [[etiquette]] to behave in society.
