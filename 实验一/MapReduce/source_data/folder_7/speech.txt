 '''Speech''' is when [[wikt:speak|spoken]] [[language]] is used to [[communication|communicate]]. Only humans have language. [[Animal]]s do not have speech, but some (birds are a good example) can communicate with each other by using [[nonverbal communication|sounds and gestures]]. < ref > Lieberman, Philip. 1991.

 Speech is made by sounds vibrating the [[vocal folds]]. Sounds through the voice box is shaped by the jaw, tongue, teeth, [[palate]], lips, and nose. 
 
 To make speech a person has to be able to: 
 #choose speech sounds 
 #put them into a sequence  
 #produce sound in the voice box  
 #use the lips, tongue, teeth, nose and palate to shape the sounds 
 
 Difficulties can happen at any stage of this four-stage process. A [[speech and language therapist]] can help work out the stage of the sequence that has difficulties and give therapy. < ref > Bauman-Waengler J. 2000.

 Effective speech includes the following elements – fluency, flexibility, accuracy, and comprehensibility. 
 
 * '''Fluency''' is the ability to communicate an intended message, or affect the listener in the way that is intended by the speaker.   
 
 *'''Flexibility''' is the ability to adjust the message according to the responses of the listener. It also involves choosing words and expressions which will be understood by the listener(s). Compare with [[Cross-cultural communication]]. 
 
 * '''Accuracy''' is the use of proper [[grammar]] in spoken language. 
 
 * '''Comprehensibility''' is the ability to be understood by others. There are three components of sound which influence one’s comprehensibility:  
 ::''Pronunciation'': saying the sounds of words correctly;  
 ::''Intonation'': applying proper stress and rhythm while speaking; and  
 ::''Enunciation'': speaking clearly at an appropriate pace and volume.
