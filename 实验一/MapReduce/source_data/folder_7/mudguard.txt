 A '''mudguard''', '''fender''' or '''wing''' is a part covering the wheels of a vehicle to stop it from throwing off [[mud]], water or objects from the road. It protects people and property from dirtiness, dampness, and damage.  
 
 Mudguards protect in several ways: 
 # They protect brakes and lights. 
 # They protect the bicycle from getting rusted by mud and water. 
 # They protect clothes from being dirty. 
 # They protect from injuries.
