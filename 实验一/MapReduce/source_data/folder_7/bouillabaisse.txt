 '''Bouillabaisse''' is a [[French cuisine|French]] [[fisherman]]'s [[soup]]. This traditional [[Provence|Provençal]] fish [[stew]] originated in the port  of [[Marseille]]. The word is a compound of ''bolhir'' (to [[boiling|boil]]) and ''abaissar'' (to reduce heat, i.e., [[simmer]]). 
 
 It was a [[stew]] made by Marseille fishermen using the bony [[rockfish]] they were unable to sell. As well as fish, the soup has [[mussels]] (fr: ''moules'') and may have other marine [[invertebrates]]. Vegetables such as [[leek]]s, [[onion]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[celery]], and [[potato]]es are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish. 
 
 The broth is traditionally served with a [[rouille]], a [[mayonnaise]] made of [[olive oil]], [[garlic]], [[saffron]], and [[cayenne pepper]] on grilled slices of bread. 
 
 In Marseille, the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and ''rouille'', then the fish is served separately on a large platter  (see image). A simpler version has the fish and broth brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates. < ref > " Serve the bouillon very hot with the ''rouille'' in soup plates with thick slices of country bread rubbed with garlic. Then serve the fish and the potatoes (Jean-Louis André, ''Cuisines des pays de France'', Éditions du Chêne, 2001)  " The fish are served on a platter, and the broth in a tureen, and you eat both together in large soup plates. "  (Julia Child, ''The French Chef Cookbook.'', Knopf, 1968) < /ref >
