[[Image:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|right|thumb|220px|[[Hammurabi]]'s Babylonia, 1792–1750 [[BC]] (middle chronology)]] 
 '''Babylonia''' was a city state in [[Mesopotamia]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]], over 3000 years ago. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] was [[Babylon]], which meant ''The Gate of the Gods''. They built an empire out of the lands of the former [[Akkad]]ian empire. 
 
 Mesopotamia is the region of the two rivers, [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]]. At that time the region also included the city states of [[Assyria]] to the north, and [[Elam]] to the south-east. It is part of the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Middle East]]. It was there people first lived together in a [[civilization]], with [[farming]], cities and [[writing]].

 The Babylonians had a [[Writing system|written language]] that they used for trade and communication. They got it from the [[Sumer]]ians, who invented it. The Babylonians used the same [[cuneiform]] system of pressing triangular shapes into soft [[clay]]. They wrote in two different languages: Sumerian for religious purposes and [[Akkadian language]] for official purposes. < ref name='Deutscher' > {{Cite book|title=Syntactic change in Akkadian: The evolution of sentential complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199532223|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}} < /ref > 
 
 === Laws === 
 [[Hammurabi]] was a king of Babylon who fought wars. He made Babylonia into an empire by putting Assyria under a [[vassal]] ([[puppet]]) king. He made the earliest written set of [[law]]s, the ''Code of Hammurabi''. It has 280 judgments. It can be seen today in the [[Louvre]], in [[Paris]]. The earlier Sumerian punishments had not been harsh, but Babylonian law was quite severe. The [[death penalty]] was given for theft, murder, and other crimes. 
 
 === Buildings === 
 The houses in Babylon had open roofs, so that on hot nights, the family could sleep there. The living rooms, dining rooms, and the kitchens were, of course, downstairs. Lamps burned with olive oil, and every house had a [[chapel]] for burial and worship ceremonies. Since Mesopotamia had only clay for use in building, the strong wooden supports for the houses were imported from [[Lebanon]]. Eventually, people began baking their bricks and improved the strength of their buildings. 
 
 == Sack of Babylon == 
 Later, Babylon was sacked by the Hittite king [[Musilis I]], < ref > Sacking a city: conquering it with much destruction. < /ref >  which led to the so-called 'Dark Ages' of the [[Bronze Age]], where there is little evidence in writing. The date of the sacking of Babylon is debated by archaeologists, who have proposed no fewer than four chronologies. Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are: 
 *ultra-short chronology: 1499 BC 
 *short chronology: 1531 BC 
 *middle chronology: 1595 BC 
 *long chronology: 1651 BC 
 The difficulty is to line up the Mesopotamian dates with the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian dates.

 After the Hittite destruction, Babylon was ruled by [[Kassite]]s for 576 years. Next it was ruled by [[Elam]], and then regained its independence for about three centuries. They were then conquered by the Neo-[[Assyria]]ns. A century later they again became free, to form the Neo-Babylonian or [[Chaldea]]n Empire. This constant conquest and re-conquest is partly due to geography. There are no natural boundaries except the rivers, and it is easy to get at the cities from north or south. 
 
 The king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] reigned for 43 years. He conquered [[Phoenicia]] in 585 BC. < ref > {{Cite web | title=World Wide School |work=History of Phoenicia & nbsp;— Part IV  | url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/ancient/HistoryofPhoenicia/chap22.html | access-date=2007-01-09}} < /ref > 
 
 == Cyrus the Great == 
 The Babylonian empire was finally brought to an end by [[Cyrus the Great]] of [[Persia]].  
 
 It was in 549 BC that Cyrus put an end to the empire of the [[Medes]]. Three years later Cyrus had become king of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (Persia), and was engaged in a campaign in northern Mesopotamia.  
 
 In 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia. A battle was fought at [[Opis]] in the month of June, where the Babylonians were defeated; and immediately afterwards [[Sippara]] surrendered to the invader. Two days after the capture of Sippara,  " the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting " . Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of ''Marchesvan'' (October), Gobryas having acted for him in his absence. Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon. 
 
 Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of their god [[Bel-Marduk]]. The invasion of Babylonia by Cyrus was doubtless helped by the presence of foreign forced exiles like the [[Jews]], who had been planted in the midst of the country. 
 
 One of the first acts of Cyrus was to allow these exiles to return to their own homes, carrying with them the images of their god and their sacred vessels. The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation, whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian [[throne]]. The feeling was still strong that none had a right to rule over [[western Asia]] until he had been consecrated to the office by Bel and his priests; and accordingly, Cyrus henceforth assumed the imperial title of  " King of Babylon. " 
 
 ==Food== 
 Like the Sumerians, the Babylonians ate vegetables, fruits, meat, and fish. They also ate bread and enjoyed toasting and eating the pesky but crunchy [[locusts]] which destroyed their precious crops. 
 
 ==Art and science== 
 The Babylonians loved art. Beautiful vessels ornamented with sparkling gold were buried with the kings. In those days books dealt with floods which were thought to be caused by sin, or about the journey of [[Abraham]].  
 Science, too, improved well: they invented the first calendar, the 60-minute hour, and the advance multiplication table. 
 
 Life was rich, full, and usually peaceful. People rarely thought about war or how to protect the city. As a result, Babylon was conquered in 730 BC by the Assyrians and Kassites. This great civilization then ended.
