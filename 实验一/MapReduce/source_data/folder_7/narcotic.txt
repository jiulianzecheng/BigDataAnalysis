A '''narcotic''' is a [[drug]] that causes a loss of feeling, or [[paralysis]]. The name ''narcotic'' was probably first used by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[physician]] [[Galen]]. Galen listed [[mandrake]] [[root]] or [[poppy juice]] among the main examples for such substances. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AWpxJREw_IAC & dq=hippocrates+narcosis & pg=PA152|title=Stimulants and Narcotics: their mutual relations|author=Francis Edmund Anstie|year=1865|isbn=9780405135682 |accessdate=2007-06-10}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.chez.com/asklepios/areteus/|title=De Furore, cap VI|language=Latin}} < /ref > 
 
 Today, the word ''narcotic'' is mainly used for [[illegal drugs]], which do not necessarily have these properties. [[Marijuana]] and [[cocaine]] are considered to be narcotics, even they do not have the medical properties described.
