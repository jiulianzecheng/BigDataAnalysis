 '''Mario Fortino Alfonso Moreno Reyes''' (12 August 1911 – 20 April 1993), known by the [[stage name]] '''Cantinflas''' ({{IPA-es|kanˈtiɱflas}}), was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] comedian and stage and movie actor. He often played poor peasants. He became associated with Mexico, and had a long, successful movie career, including some time in [[Hollywood]]. [[Charlie Chaplin]] once said that Moreno  was the best comedian alive, and Moreno has been called the  " Charlie Chaplin of Mexico " . To audiences in the [[United States]], he is best remembered as costarring with [[David Niven]] in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). 
 
 Moreno also was involved in Mexico's labor politics, which were often dangerous. Although he was a political conservative, his reputation as somebody who spoke for the poor made him seem real, and became important in the early struggle against charrismo, the one-party government's practice of taking over unions.
