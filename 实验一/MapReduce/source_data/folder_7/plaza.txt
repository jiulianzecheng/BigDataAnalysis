 '''Plaza''' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word related to  " field "  which describes an open public space in a city, such as a [[city square]]. In Spanish America, the '''plaza mayor''' of each city had three things: the [[cathedral]], the ''[[cabildo]]'' or administrative center, and the ''audiencia'' or law court. The plaza might be large enough to serve as a military parade ground. At times of crisis or [[fiesta]], it was a space where many people could be together at once. Similar to Italian [[piazza]]s, plazas are still a center of community life, like the market-place. 
 
 Most colonial cities in Spanish America were planned around a square ''[[Plaza de Armas|plaza de armas]]'', where troops could gather. 
 
 A ''plaza de toros'' is a [[bullring]].
