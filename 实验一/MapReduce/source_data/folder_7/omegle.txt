'''Omegle''' was a [[website]] that allows one to talk with one person [[Anonymity|anonymous]]ly and [[random]]ly without signing up. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/technology/internet/27omegle.html |title=Tired of Old Web Friends? A New Site Promises Strangers |access-date=2009-10-23 |publisher=New York Times }} < /ref >  The [[nickname]]s that are used are  " You "  and  " Stranger " . It was started in late March 2009 by an eighteen-year-old, Leif K-Brooks, who lives in [[Vermont]]. 
 
 On November 8, 2023, Leif K-Brooks announced Omegle's shutdown, attributing it to insurmountable challenges and highlighting his efforts to maintain user safety amidst growing misuse and societal fear.

 {{Unsourced section|date=December 2020}} 
 The website has started using a lot of new things in the chat. One thing is that people can chat using [[webcam]]s. Another feature of Omegle (which has since been removed from the website) was that one person could ask something while watching two other strangers discussing it. Usually, the asker couldnâ€™t talk, but they could watch them discuss the question. You can also type in common interests, these will only connect you to people who have the same interests. 
 
 == Criticism == 
 The website does not ban users because of their age. A user may experience nudity or sexual content on camera. < ref name= " bbctech " > {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8539701.stm|title=Chatroulette and Omegle: chat rooms with a twist| publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |access-date=2010-06-06}} < /ref >  K-Brooks says, that at one time, he felt  " disappointment "  at the way in which the site has been used. < ref name= " bbctech " / >  Since 2013, Omegle has monitored the video chats. There is a moderated video section and an unmoderated video section. The unmoderated video section is for adults who are 18 and over. The moderated video section is for everyone. If someone is seen naked on the moderated video section, they will be banned and only be able to use the unmoderated section.
