 In [[physics]], '''cryogenics''' is the production and behaviour of materials at very low [[temperature]]s. 
 
 It is not well defined at what point on the temperature scale [[refrigeration]] ends and cryogenics begins. A gas may be cryogenic if it can be liquefied at or below {{convert|-150|°C|K °F|0|lk=on}}. < ref name= " saturn " > {{cite book|author=Bilstein, Roger E.

 The U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] considers cryogenics as involving temperatures below {{convert|-180|°C|K °F|0}}. The normal [[boiling point]]s of [[helium]], [[hydrogen]], [[neon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and normal [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] are below −180 & nbsp;°C.  
 
 The [[Freon]] refrigerants, [[hydrocarbon]]s, and other common refrigerants have boiling points above −180 & nbsp;°C. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dichlorodifluoromethane#section=Chemical-and-Physical-Properties|title=DICHLORODIFLUOROMETHANE at Pubchem|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/propane#section=Boiling-Point|title=PROPANE at Pubchem|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}} < /ref > 
 
 Discovery of [[superconducting]] materials has raised interest in reliable, low cost methods of producing high temperature cryogenic refrigeration. The term  " high temperature cryogenic "  means temperatures from above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, {{convert|-195.79|°C|K °F|2}}, up to {{convert|-50|°C|K °F|0}}. < ref > J. M. Nash 1991.

 Cryogenicists use the [[Kelvin scale|Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] temperature scale, both of which measure from [[absolute zero]], rather than more usual scales such as [[Celsius scale|Celsius]] which measures from the freezing point of water at sea level or [[Fahrenheit scale|Fahrenheit]] with its zero at an arbitrary temperature. 
 
 == Uses == 
 *[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is an important machine for hospital diagnosis. It shows internal damage to soft tissues, and is very important in brain surgery. 
 *[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] is used for the physical and chemical properties of atoms. 
 *[[Rocket]] cryogenic fuel is used as a propellant. 
 *Cryogenics create the temperatures needed to store or transport large amounts of [[food]] without it deteriorating. 
 *Many physical experiments need cryogenic temperatures. 
 *Underground cables transmitting [[electricity]] are made much more efficient if they are cooled to cryogenic temperatures.
