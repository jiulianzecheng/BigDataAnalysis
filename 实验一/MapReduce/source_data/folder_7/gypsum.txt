 '''Gypsum''' (CaSO < sub > 4 < /sub > .2H < sub > 2 < /sub > O) is a common [[sulfate mineral]] made of [[calcium sulfate]]. Gypsum has been used as a building material for a long time, possibly since the [[neolithic]]. Today, it is used in [[drywall]], and as an ingredient of [[plaster of paris|plaster of Paris]]. It can also be used as a [[fertilizer]]. It is softer than most minerals, with a value of 2 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. This mineral can be, somewhat, scratched with your fingernail. A fingernail, with a value of 2.5 on the  [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]] is in fact higher than the mineral shown above. It is an ingredient of [[Portland cement]]. Gypsum was used in [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] by sculptors. It is also used in making surgical and orthopedic cast molds.
