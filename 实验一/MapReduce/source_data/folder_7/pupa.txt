 A '''pupa''' (plural: '''pupae''' or '''pupas''') is part of becoming an [[adult]] for some [[insect]]s, like some [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[moth]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[bee]]s. The pupal stage comes after being a [[larva]]; the next stage is adulthood. 
 
 The pupa stage of a butterfly, called a [[chrysalis]] (plural  " chrysalids " ), is a well-known example of a pupa because they are often found in the open.
