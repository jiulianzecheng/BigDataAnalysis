 A '''bogie''' (called a '''truck''' in North American English) is a chassis, with wheels, attached to a rail vehicle, such as a [[boxcar]]. A bogie usually has four or six wheels. Each rail vehicle has a pair of bogies. The bogies can turn slightly to allow the rail vehicle to pass easily around curves in the [[railway track]].
