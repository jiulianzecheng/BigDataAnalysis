 '''''Acanthopolis''''' (meaning  " spiny scales " ) was an [[armour]]ed [[ankylosauria]]n [[dinosaur]]. This quadrupedal plant-eating dinosaur had its armour in rows of oval plates set into its skin. It also had spikes jutting out of its neck and shoulder area along the spine. It was about 15 feet long (4 m) and weighed roughly 380 & nbsp;kg. 
 
 The first specimen was found in 1865 by [[fossil]] collector John Griffiths on the [[shore]]line at [[Folkestone]]. The [[stratum]] was Cambridge Greensand, a formation in the [[Lower Cretaceous]] of southern [[England]]. At the time England was part of a huge [[tropical]] [[river delta]], and the Greensand was laid down just offshore. It seems that dinosaurs were on the [[shore]]line or the river delta, and sometimes their bodies washed out to sea.
