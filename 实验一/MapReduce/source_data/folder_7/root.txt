 The '''roots''' of a [[plant]] is the part that is usually buried in the [[soil]]. Roots are usually always under the soil, though–sometimes roots can be above the ground. This is called an [[aerial root]]. 
 
 Also, [[Plant stem|stems]] can sometimes be under the soil ([[potato]]es, for example). Roots do not have [[leaf|leaves]], and are different from stems inside. 
 
 Plants need their roots especially for three reasons: The roots take [[water]] and [[nutrients]], a sort of [[food]], from the soil. They also often store this food. And they [[wikt:fix|fix]] the plants to the [[ground]]. 
 
 However, most plant roots do not work at their best unless they have help from [[fungi]]. The symbiosis between roots and fungus is known as [[mycorrhiza]]. < ref > Brundrett M.C. 2002. Coevolution of roots and mycorrhizas of land plants. ''New phytologist'' '''154'''(2): 275-304.

 There are two sorts of '''root''' systems: 
 * the taproot system: there is one very big root that goes down into the ground, and many smaller roots that come out of it 
 * the diffuse root system: there are many roots that go in all directions 
 
 Some roots go very deep into the ground. One root that was found in [[Arizona]], [[USA]], was 60 & nbsp;m below the [[surface]]. 
 
 Roots are also very strong. Some tree roots can destroy [[stone]]s.  Roots are not green because the cells have no [[chlorophyll]]. 
 
 == Root growth == 
 Roots grow through the whole life of the plant. They grow longer from the tip, adding [[cell]]s to the end of each root. < ref name= " Cells " > {{cite book| last1 = Lewin| first1 = Benjamin| last2 = Cassimeris| first2 = Lynne| last3 = Plopper| first3 = George| title = Cells| date = 2007| publisher = Jones  &  Bartlett Publishers| isbn = 978-0-7637-3905-8| page = 765| chapter = How plants grow }} < /ref >  The root adds cells to their tips, and they grow fatter as they add cells around their tube-like bodies. 
 
 At the tip of each root, there is a small group of tough, [[dead]], hard cells called the ''root cap''. < ref name= " Raven2001 " > {{cite journal

 == Aerial roots == 
 {{Main|Aerial root}} 
 
 Roots are usually found underground, but in some cases this is not so. In the [[rainforest]], the air is warm and [[humidity|humid]] (it has a lot of water). Some rainforest plants, known as [[epiphyte]]s, grow right on trees. Their roots hang down in the air or running into the [[moss]] growing on the trees. < ref name= " squash " > Schenk H.J. and R.B. Jackson. 2002. The global biogeography of roots. ''Ecological Monographs'' '''72''' (3): 311-328 < /ref >  Many aerial roots, are used to receive water and nutrient intake directly from the air, from fog, dew or humid air. 
 
 Some trees have roots that are above the ground ''and'' underground. [[Mangrove]] trees have [[aerial root]]s (roots which come up into the air). They exchange gases with the [[atmosphere]], just as leaves do. They are an [[adaptation]] to the poor level of [[oxygen]] in the waterlogged soil of the mangrove [[swamp]]. < ref > Attenborough, David 1995. ''The private life of plants: a natural history of plant behaviour''. BBC Books, London. < /ref > 
 
 The [[banyan]] tree has a root system that is underground, but it also has roots that start in its branches and grow down towards the ground. These roots not only take in water and nutrients from the [[soil]], but they also help to support the long branches of the banyan tree. Because of this extra support, banyan tree branches can be really long. A banyantree in Lahaina, [[Maui]], which was planted in 1873 by a man named William Owen Smith, has branches that are so long that this single tree covers a full square block in the city. 
 
 Much about aerial roots is still unknown. < ref > [http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/364/2067.full The physiological ecology of vascular epiphytes: current knowledge, open questions] < /ref > 
 
 == Root systems == 
 There are two main kinds of roots systems: ''taproot systems'' and ''fibrous root systems''. A taproot system has one thick main root growing down from the plant's [[Plant stem|stem]], and lots of smaller ''secondary roots'' [[branch]]ing off from this. A taproot system is usually deeper than it is wide. Often, we eat taproots, like [[carrot]]s and [[turnip]]s. 
 
 A ''fibrous root system'' has lots of roots growing in many directions. There is not one main root. A fibrous root system is usually wider than deep. 
 
 == Root pumping == 
 It has been usually assumed that in regular (non-aerial) terrestrial roots, the nutrients are pumped in together with the water, and that water is pumped into the roots by [[osmosis]]. Recent studies in large trees such as the Giant Sequoia, showed, that much of the pumping power, after initial growth, is received by hydraulic suction, due to [[transpiration]] - water evaporation from the leaves, in addition to the strong [[capillary action]] in the plant's branching [[xylem]] in the stem and leaves. < ref > {{cite book| authors = H.
