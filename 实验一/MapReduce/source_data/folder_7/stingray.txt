 The '''stingrays''' are a large suborder of the [[batoidea|rays]]. They are [[cartilaginous fish]] related to [[shark]]s. They are in the suborder '''Myliobatoidei''' of the order [[Myliobatiformes]], which consists of nine families. < ref > {{cite book|last=Gross|first=Miriam J.|title=The Stingray|url=https://archive.org/details/stingray0000gros|publisher=Powerkids Press|location=New York|date=2006|isbn=9781404231900}} < /ref > 
 
 Most stingrays have one or more barbed stings on the tail, which is used ''only'' for [[self-defence]]. The sting may reach about 35 & nbsp;cm, and its underside has two grooves with [[Venom (poison)|venom]] [[gland]]s. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.fishchannel.com/media/fish-magazines/aquarium-fish-international/july-2008/venom2.aspx.pdf | title = Dangerous and Venomous Aquarium Fish | author = Ternay, A. | website = fishchannel.com | access-date = 2011-09-15 | archive-date = 2014-07-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722215257/http://www.fishchannel.com/media/fish-magazines/aquarium-fish-international/july-2008/venom2.aspx.pdf | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  The sting is covered with a thin layer of skin, the sheath, in which the venom is held. < ref > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1580/1080-6032(1997)008[0024:SI]2.3.CO;2 | author = Meyer, P. | title = Stingray injuries | journal = Wilderness Environ Med | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–8 | year = 1997 | pmid = 11990133}} < /ref >  A few members of the suborder, such as the [[manta ray]]s and the [[porcupine ray]], do not have stings. < ref name=FB > Froese, Rainer, and Daniel Pauly, eds. 2009.

 Stingrays are common in coastal [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] marine waters throughout the world. There are species in warm [[temperate]] oceans, and some found in the ocean. Some live in [[fresh water]]. Most stingrays live at or near the bottom of the water, but some are [[pelagic]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/gallery/descript/pelagicstingray/pelagicstingray.html | title = Pelagic stingray | author-last= Bester |author-first=C |author-first2=H.F.|author-last2= Mollett|author-first3=J. |author-last3=Bourdon | publisher = Florida Museum of Natural History, Ichthyology department | access-date = 2011-09-15 | archive-date = 2016-01-15 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115085500/http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/PelagicStingray/PelagicStingray.html }} < /ref > 
 
 == Lifestyle == 
 Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tail visible. [[Coral reef]]s are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.divephotoguide.com/underwater-photography-scuba-ocean-news/stingray_city___altering_stingray_behavior___physiology/|title=Stingray City & nbsp;— Altering Stingray Behavior  &  Physiology?|website=DivePhotoGuide}} < /ref > 
 
 The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to hide themselves. Stingrays agitate the sand and hide beneath it. Their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides. Stingrays  use smell and electro-receptors (like those of [[shark]]s) to find their prey. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.scubaboard.com/community/threads/stingray-behavior.248739/|title=Stingray behavior?|website=ScubaBoard}} < /ref > 
 
 Stingrays feed mostly on [[mollusca|mollusc]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and occasionally on small fish. Some stingrays' mouths have two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species have sucking mouthparts that bring in the [[plankton]]. 
 
 === Reproduction === 
 Stingrays are [[ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]], bearing live young in 'litters' of five to thirteen. The female holds the embryos in the womb without a placenta. Instead, the embryos absorb nutrients from a [[yolk sac]], and after the sac is depleted, the mother provides uterine 'milk'. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/dasyatis-sabina/|title=Dasyatis sabina|date=9 May 2017|website=Florida Museum}} < /ref > 
 
 At the Sea Life London Aquarium two female stingrays have delivered seven baby stingrays, although the mothers have not been near a male for two years.  " Rays have been known to store sperm and not give birth until they decide the timing is right " . < !--rem deprecated source (dailymail)-- > 
 
 Like all fish, stingrays get little  [[parasite]]s (such as [[Trematoda|flukes]] or [[copepod]]s) on their [[gill]]s or body. A [[cleaner fish]] helps the stingrays by eating the parasites it can get at. 
 
 == Families == 
 There are eight families in the stingray group. They are: 
 #[[Hexatrygonidae]] (sixgill stingray), 
 #[[Plesiobatidae]] (deep water stingray), 
 #[[Urolophidae]] (stingarees), 
 #[[Urotrygonidae]] (round rays), 
 #[[Dasyatidae]] (whiptail stingrays), 
 #[[Potamotrygonidae]] (river stingrays), 
 #[[Gymnuridae]] (butterfly rays), and 
 #[[Myliobatidae]] (eagle rays). < ref name=nelson > Nelson J.S. 2006.
