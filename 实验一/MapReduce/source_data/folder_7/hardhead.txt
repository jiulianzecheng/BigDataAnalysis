 The '''hardhead''' (''Aythya australis''), also known as the '''white eyed duck''', is the only true [[diving duck]] found in Australia. The common name  " hardhead "  has nothing to do with the hardness of the bird's skull, instead referring to the difficulty encountered by early [[Taxidermy|taxidermists]] in studying the head. Hardheads are found in wetter, coastal regions of Australia, particularly in the south-east, but are known to live as far as [[New Guinea]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Pacific Islands]].
