An '''allergy'''  is something which triggers an '''allergic reaction'''. This is the [[immune system]] defending the [[body]] against attack by [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.  
 
 Sometimes the system goes wrong, and is triggered by some quite normal food, or flares up when the family pet comes into the room. This is what the ordinary person calls an 'allergy'. 
 
 == Allergic reactions == 
 When people come in contact with something they are allergic to, there can be many different reactions. These reactions include itchy eyes,  drippy or stuffy noses, swollen faces, hives, sneezing, and coughing. If it is a food allergy, the person may get an upset stomach.  
 
 Sometimes a person's [[oesophagus]], or throat, may swell up so much that the person can no longer breathe. This is called [[anaphylaxis]]. When this happens, a doctor must give the person a medicine called [[epinephrine]] to make the swelling go down. Some people with allergies to very common things, like bee stings or fish, carry this medicine with them so it can be used quickly in an emergency. The device they use to inject the medicine is called an epinephrine autoinjector.
