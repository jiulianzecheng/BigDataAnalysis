 '''Baldness''' (also known as '''alopecia''') is when someone has no hair on his or her [[head]]. Sometimes this is [[inherit]]ed from parents or grandparents, or it can be done on purpose. Improper use of hair extensions can also lead to [https://jenhair.com/blog/do-hair-extensions-cause-hair-loss.html hair loss]. Some people such as [[monk]]s or [[South Korean]] soldiers [[Shaving|shave]] their head. 
 
 Baldness is most often caused by a medical [[disease|condition]] known as '''androgenic alopecia'''. This is found in [[human]]s, as well as in some [[animal]]s. When it occurs, it will mean that those affected will permanently lose some (or all) of their hair. Since some of the factors are linked to the [[gene]]s on the [[chromosome]], the condition can be seen more often with men, than with women.

 '''Alopecia totalis''' is the loss of all head hair. Its cause is believed to be [[autoimmune]], but many with the disorder lead relatively low stress lives. 
 
 '''Alopecia areata''' (AA) is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp. Because it causes bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages, it is sometimes called spot baldness.
