'''Decaffeination''' is a process which tries to remove most [[caffeine]] from things that contain it. Examples of plants that have caffeine in them are [[coffee]] beans, [[mate (drink)|mate]], [[tea]] leaves and [[cocoa]]. Soft drinks that do not have caffeine in them are sometimes called '''decaffeinated'''. While the caffeine is removed from some of them, it is simply not added to others, like [[Coca Cola]].  
 
 There are different processes to remove the caffeine. 
 
 Drinks that were produced from plants that had their caffeine removed are not free of caffeine; they still contain a little. It is simply not possible to remove all caffeine.
