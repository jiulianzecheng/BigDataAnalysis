 Kimchi is usually very strong for non-Koreans. There are many different types and Koreans typically eat kimchi in every meal. It is a staple of Korean food. Kimchi can be stored for a long time and it does not go bad easily. However, when it is exposed to hot weather for certain time, kimchi turns sour. So, it should not be put out unless it is going to be eaten soon. In Korea kimchi pots are a common sight. They are large [[terra cotta]] pots where the kimchi is stored until it can be eaten or until it [[fermentation|ferments]]. Kimchi usually takes about 2 weeks to ferment, but some varieties can be eaten right away. Some must be stored for over a year to be finished.  
 
 The fermentation gives the kimchi a [[pickle]]-like quality and generally soggy or limp kimchi is not good. 
 
 == Varieties == 
 Every different kind of kimchi has a special taste and a different amount of time to ferment. Baechu Kimchi is one of the most famous kimchi. Kkakdugi is made of cubed Korean radish (mu).

Gat kimchi is made from dark green Korean mustard (gat) leaves and stems. These can be kept for months or even longer. As these age, they taste like lemons. Oi Sobagi has a refreshing, cool, and hot taste. Cucumber is the main ingredient for it. It can be kept for about a week. As it ages, it also taste like a lemon.

 The most common variety of kimchi is made from cabbage, radish, [[garlic]], red pepper, salt and sugar. The cabbage is soaked in [[salt water]] for a few hours. Coarse rock salt is then rubbed in between the leaves of the cabbage. Red peppers are also rubbed in and most Kimchi has a lot of pepper in it. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Kimchi|title=Kimchi - New World Encyclopedia|website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-19}} < /ref >  The radish is usually cut into long thin strips and added to the mix.
