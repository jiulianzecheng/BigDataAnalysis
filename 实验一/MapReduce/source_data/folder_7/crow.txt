 '''Crows''' form the [[genus]] '''''Corvus''''' in the family [[Corvidae]]. They are medium to large sized birds, carnivores and scavengers. 
 
 The genus includes the crow ([[carrion crow]] or [[hooded crow]]), the [[rook]], [[jackdaw]], and the large common [[raven]]. The genus has 40 or so members on all temperate [[continent]]s except for [[South America]], and some islands.  
 
 The ''Corvus'' makes up a third of the species in the Corvidae. Crows appear to have evolved in Asia from corvid stock which had evolved in [[Australia]]. The collective name for a group of crows is a ''flock'' or, more poetically, a ''murder''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/2009/02/murder-of-crows-etc |title=Murder of Crows, etc. |publisher=Word-detective.com |access-date=2011-11-12}} < /ref >

 They have a brain size (adjusted for body size) as large as some apes. < ref > Of course, the absolute size of the brain is also important. < /ref >  The [[jackdaw]] and the [[European magpie]] have a ''nidopallium'' about the same relative size as the equivalent [[neocortex]] in [[chimpanzees]], < ref > nidopallium: the region of the avian brain that is used mostly for executive functions and other higher cognitive tasks. < /ref >  and significantly larger than is found in the [[gibbon]]. < ref > {{cite book|title=Comparative vertebrate cognition: are primates superior to non-primates?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e021s7atsicC & dq=Comparative+vertebrate+cognition:+are+primates+superior+to+non-primates & pg=PA9 |author= Rogers, Lesley J.; Kaplan, Gisela T. |page= 9|publisher= Springer|location=New York, New York|year=2004|isbn=0-306-47727-0}} < /ref >
