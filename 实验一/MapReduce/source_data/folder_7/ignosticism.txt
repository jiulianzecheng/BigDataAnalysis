'''Ignosticism''' is the [[belief]] that people should avoid taking a position on  " the existence of [[God]] "  until a [[concept]] of [[God]] has been [[definition|defined]]. 
 
 Ignostics claim that the sound or row of alphabet letters  " God "  (with a capital  " G " ) is meaningless because they lack belief that any coherent definition has been presented.  They claim ignorance of any meaningful definition for  " God "  that has been given. 
 
 Ignostics claim that  " God is what caused everything to exist that exists except God "  is not only circular, allegedly defining  " God "  in terms of  " God " , but also gives no description for  " God "  since  " what something did "  is not  " what something is " . 
 
 It is sometimes considered synonymous with [[theological noncognitivism]].
