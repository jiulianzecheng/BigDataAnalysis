 A '''bathhouse''' is a building where people can [[hygiene|bathe]]. < ref name=BBC / >  In some bathhouses, people put their whole bodies in the water.  In others, people clean themselves using [[steam bath|steam]] or even sweat. Bathhouses are usually communal, which means people take [[bath]]s together and not alone.  Some bathhouses are only about getting clean and other bathhouses are also a place for people to talk to each other. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the bathhouse in Mohenjo-daro.]] 
 In the early 1900s, [[archaeologist]]s found ruins of a bathhouse in [[Mohenjo-daro]].  This is in [[Pakistan]] today.  The bathhouse was built around 2500 b.c.e.  It was made out of bricks and it might have been part of a [[temple]]. < ref name=BBC / >   Archaeologists found a Jewish [[mikveh]] from the 500s c.e. in ruins underneath [[Syracuse]]. < ref name=Arch / > 
 
 By 300 BC, bathhouses called ''[[thermae]]'' were common in [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] towns. < ref name=BBC > {{cite news|publisher=[[BBC]] Travel|accessdate=July 8, 2021|title=The origins of bathhouse culture around the world|url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20121129-the-origins-of-bathhouse-culture-around-the-world|date=November 29, 2012|author=Suemedha Sood}} < /ref >   The Roman writer [[Tiberius Claudius Secundus]] wrote,  " Baths, drink and sex corrupt our bodies, but baths, drink and sex make life worth living.

 People in Japan and Korea have been using [[hot spring]]s for bathing for thousands of years.  People started bathing at the [[Dogo Onsen]] on [[Shikoku]] 3000 years ago. < ref name=BBC / >

 The [[Roman Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]] affected bathing in the [[Middle East]].  The Middle Eastern [[hammam]] bath is like a Roman bath: A place to get clean and to talk to other people.  In the 600s and 700s c.e., the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliphs]] built baths with [[mosaic]] decorations on the floors. < ref name=Met > {{cite web|title=Baths and Bathing Culture in the Middle East: The Hammam|accessdate=July 9, 2021|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bath/hd_bath.htm|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|author=Elizabeth Williams|year=2012}} < /ref > 
 In the [[Medieval period]], there were many baths, called [[hammam]] in the Middle East.  [[Baghdad]] may have had  60,000 bathhouses.  Unlike in Roman baths, men and women did not bathe together.  There were different places for men and women. < ref name=Met / >

 In [[Medieval Europe]] most people who lived in towns went to bathhouses to bathe.  The medical book ''[[Secreta Secretorum]]'' has a chapter on bathing. It said winter and spring were good times to bathe but that people should not bathe in summer.  By 1200 AD, there were 32 bathhouses in [[Paris]].  Bathhouses were often right next to the town [[bakery]] so the heat from the ovens could make the water hot.  In Germany in the 1400s, some people ate meals in baths.  Sometimes bathhouses were [[brothel]]s in disguise.  When the disease [[syphilis]] reached Europe, bathhouses became less popular there. < ref name=Med > {{cite web|url=https://www.medievalists.net/2013/04/did-people-in-the-middle-ages-take-baths/|accessdate=July 9, 2021|title=Did people in the Middle Ages take baths?|date=13 April 2013|publisher=Medievalists}} < /ref > 
 
 In the [[Victorian period]] a diplomat called David Urquhart went to the [[Ottoman Empire]], where he saw Ottoman baths.  He came back to England and built bathhouses there.  A person called [[Sinan]] built many baths.  Some were for rich people and some were to clean the poor.  This happened before indoor plumbing, which let almost every house have its own bathtub. < ref name=Arch / >

 People in other countries built bathhouses near hot springs too.  The most famous bathhouses in the United States may be [[Bathhouse Row]] in [[Hot Springs National Park]] Arkansas, eight buildings made between 1892 and 1923. < ref name=BRT > {{cite web|title=Bathhouse Row Today|accessdate=July 9, 2021|url=https://www.nps.gov/hosp/learn/historyculture/bathhouse-row-today.htm|publisher=United States National Parks Service}} < /ref > < ref name=Ark > {{cite web|url=https://www.arkansas.com/articles/bathhouse-row|publisher=Arkansas.com|accessdate=July 9, 2021|title=Bathhouse Row: A National Historic Landmark}} < /ref > 
 
 In the United States, people built bathhouses, especially during the [[Progressive Era]], when people thought the government should help people live better lives.  Indoor [[plumbing]] and pipes had made it much easier to be clean.  People in the United States thought of being clean as part of being a good person, so rich and middle-class Americans built bathhouses for poorer people.  [[New York City]] opened the People's Baths in 1891.  It was popular, so many other public bathhouses were built.  However, these bathhouses were about getting clean, not relaxing.  Bathers were not allowed to stay long, and there was no place in the bathhouse to relax or talk with other people. < ref name=JS > {{cite journal|journal=JSTOR Daily|title=Public Baths Were Meant to Uplift the Poor|url=https://daily.jstor.org/public-baths-were-meant-to-uplift-the-poor/|author=Erin Blakemore|date=September 9, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 According to writer [[Mikkel Aaland]], people in [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]] built sweat lodges to make sick people well. < ref name=Aal > {{cite web|title=Tribal Africa|url=https://www.mikkelaaland.com/tribal-africa-sweat-baths.html|accessdate=July 9, 2021|author=Mikkel Aaland|archive-date=July 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709220624/https://www.mikkelaaland.com/tribal-africa-sweat-baths.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Bathhouses became an important part of [[LGBT|gay culture]] in the United States.  The government ordered most of them closed after people in the United States caught [[AIDS]] in the 1970s and 1980s. < ref name=Arch / >

 Some bathhouses are cellular baths, meaning they have many smaller tubs.  Other bathhouses are steam baths, with all the bathers sitting around something hot, like hot rocks or fire. < ref name=Arch > {{cite magazine|magazine=Architectural Review|title=Typology: Bathhouse|url=https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/typology/typology-bathhouse|date=February 13, 2018|author=Tom Wilkinson|accessdate=July 9, 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Health== 
 
 In many cultures, people said the bathhouse was good for the health.  They especially said this about hot bathhouses, such as saunas and onsen.  In Mesoamerica, people said the hot temazcal bath would heal the sick by making [[evil spirit]]s leave. < ref name=Arch / > < ref name=Aal / > 
 
 Scientists have done experiments to see if baths really do help human health.  In addition to keeping the body clean, some types of steam baths or other hot baths can improve [[circulation]], [[blood pressure]] and diseases of the nose and breathing. < ref name=MedNews > {{cite news|publisher=Medical News Today|title=What are the benefits of a steam room|accessdate=July 8, 2021|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320314}} < /ref > < ref name=Heart > {{cite journal|title=Effect of the Steam bath on Resting Cardiovascular Parameters in Healthy Volunteers (Abstract)|author1=M.
