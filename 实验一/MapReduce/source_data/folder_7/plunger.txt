A '''plunger''' is a [[tool]]. It is used to get rid of things that are blocking [[pipe]]s. The plunger is placed over one end of the pipe, and the [[Handle (grip)|handle]] is pushed up and down. Doing this creates a [[suck]]ing [[Force (physics)|force]], which makes the thing blocking the pipe move and unclog.
