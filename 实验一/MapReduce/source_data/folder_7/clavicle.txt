 The '''clavicle''', or '''collarbone''', is a long [[bone]] that is part of the [[shoulder]]. It connects the arm to the main part of the body. It is a support for the [[scapula]] bone and helps the arm to hang freely. This allows the arm to have a lot of movement. The clavicle is made from [[sponge]]-like bone, called cancellous bone, and is covered with a hard shell of bone. Most [[mammal]]s and many other land [[vertebrate]]s have clavicles. 
 
 ''Clavicle'' is a formal scientific term. Normally we use the term ''collarbone'', both in everyday speech and literary fiction.
