 '''Watchmen''' were groups of men who discouraged [[crime]] and [[Law enforcement|enforced the law]]. They were usually authorised by the [[state]] or [[government]]. Watchmen have existed in many places around the world throughout history. Today, the job of law enforcement has generally been taken over by organised [[police]]. 
 
 An early reference to a watch can be found in the [[Bible]]. [[Ezekiel]] says that it was the watchmen's duty to sound the alarm to warn the people that they were under attack (Ezekiel 33:1-6). The [[Roman Empire]] turned the role of a watchman into a profession. The [[Vigiles]] was the city watch in [[Rome]]. It was the city's police force. 
 
 In [[England]], the [[Ordinance of 1233]] required the appointment of watchmen. < ref > {{cite book | title= The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I | last1= Pollock | first1= Frederick | last2= Maitland | first2= Frederic William | year= 1898 | page= 565 | volume= 1 | edition= 2 | isbn= 978-1-58477-718-2 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JdisvDaHiIMC & pg=PA565 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book | title= Essays on the Theory and Practice of Criminal Justice | url= https://archive.org/details/essaysontheorypr0000unse | last= Rich | first= Robert M. | year= 1977 | page= [https://archive.org/details/essaysontheorypr0000unse/page/50 50] | isbn= 978-0-8191-0235-5 | quote= The origin of the exception goes back in English history to the Ordinance of 1233 which instituted night-watchmen, and directed them 'to arrest those who enter vills at night and go about armed.'

It also required them to stop disturbances of the peace, and to take criminals to the [[sheriff]]. By 1415, a watch was appointed to the [[Parliament of England]]. [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] appointed a watch for his house, the [[Tower of London]], in 1485. These watchmen became known as the [[Beefeaters]].
