 '''''Janenschia''''' (named after [[Werner Janensch]]) was a huge, plant-eating [[dinosaur]] with an elongated neck and tail. It was a sauropod from the late [[Jurassic|Jurassic period]], about 156 million to 150 million years ago. ''Janenschia'' had a small head, blunt teeth, and a short, thick tail; it was about 80 feet (24 m) long. This [[titanosaurid]] back may have been covered with bony, armored plates. Fossils have been found in [[Tanzania]], Africa. It is said that this dinosaur was a secondary prey for T-rex.
