A '''''Regierungsbezirk''''' is a government region of [[Germany]] in some federal states ([[States of Germany|''Bundesländer'']]).  
 
 ''Regierungsbezirke'' are divided into [[district]]s (''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]''), either ''[[List of German rural districts|Landkreise]]'' or urban districts: cities which constitute a district in their own right (''[[List of German urban districts|kreisfreie Städte]]''). The ''Regierungsbezirk'' is governed by a ''Bezirksregierung'' and led by a ''Regierungspräsident''. 
 
 Not all [[States of Germany|''Bundesländer'']] have this sub-division; some are directly divided into [[German districts|districts]]. Currently, five states are divided into 22 ''Regierungsbezirke'', ranging in population from 5,255,000 ([[Düsseldorf Government Region|Düsseldorf]]) to 1,065,000 ([[Gießen Government Region|Gießen]]): 
 
 * [[Baden-Württemberg]]: [[Freiburg Government Region|Freiburg]], [[Karlsruhe Government Region|Karlsruhe]], [[Stuttgart Government Region|Stuttgart]], [[Tübingen Government Region|Tübingen]] 
 * [[Bavaria]]: [[Upper Bavaria Government Region|Oberbayern]], [[Lower Bavaria Government Region|Niederbayern]], [[Oberpfalz Government Region|Oberpfalz]], [[Upper Franconia Government Region|Oberfranken]], [[Middle Franconia|Mittelfranken]], [[Lower Franconia Government Region|Unterfranken]], [[Swabia (Government Region)|Schwaben]] 
 * [[Hesse]]: [[Darmstadt Government Region|Darmstadt]], [[Gießen Government Region|Gießen]], [[Kassel Government Region|Kassel]] 
 * [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]: [[Arnsberg Government Region|Arnsberg]], [[Cologne Government Region|Cologne]], [[Detmold Government Region|Detmold]], [[Düsseldorf Government Region|Düsseldorf]], [[Münster Government Region|Münster]] 
 * [[Saxony]]: [[Chemnitz Government Region|Chemnitz]], [[Regierungsbezirk Dresden|Dresden]], [[Leipzig Government Region|Leipzig]] 
 
 == History == 
 The first ''Regierungsbezirke'' were created by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in [[1808]]/[[1816|16]], which divided its provinces into 25 ''Regierungsbezirke''. The ''Regierungsbezirke'' of North Rhine-Westphalia are in direct continuation of those created in 1815. Other states of the [[German Empire]] created similar entities, named ''Kreishauptmannschaft'' (in Saxony) or ''Kreis'' (in Bavaria and [[Württemberg]]) (not to be confused with the ''Kreis'' or ''Landkreis'' today). During the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], the Nazi government unified the naming; since then all these entities are called ''Regierungsbezirk''. 
 
 On [[January 1]] [[2000]] [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] disbanded its three ''Regierungsbezirke'' [[Koblenz Government Region|Koblenz]], [[Rheinhessen-Pfalz]] and [[Trier Government Region|Trier]] - the employees and assets of the three ''Bezirksregierungen'' were converted into three public authorities responsible for the whole state, each covering a part of the former responsibilities of the ''Bezirksregierung''. 
 
 On [[January 1]], [[2004]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] disbanded its three ''Regierungsbezirke'': [[Dessau Government Region|Dessau]], [[Halle Government Region|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg Government Region|Magdeburg]]. The responsibilities are now covered by a ''Landesverwaltungsamt'' with three offices at the former seats of the ''Bezirksregierungen''.  
 
 On [[January 1]], [[2005]], [[Lower Saxony]] disbanded its four ''Regierungsbezirke'': [[Braunschweig Government Region|Braunschweig]], [[Hanover Government Region|Hanover]], [[Lüneburg Government Region|Lüneburg]], and [[Weser-Ems]]. 
 
 In 2005, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] planned to abolish its five ''Regierungsbezirke'' and create three self-government entities. The old,  " Prussian-style " , Regierungsbezirk had no self-government organs.
