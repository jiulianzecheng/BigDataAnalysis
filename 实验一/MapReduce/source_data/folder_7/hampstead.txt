 Hampstead has long been known as a residence of writers, composers, ballerinas, intellectuals, actors, artists and architects, many of whom created a bohemian community in the late 19th century. After 1917, and again in the 1930s, it became base to a community of avant garde artists and writers and was host to a number of émigrés and exiles from the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[Nazi]] Europe.
