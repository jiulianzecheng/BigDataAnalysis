 '''''Thecodontosaurus''''' (meaning  " socket-toothed lizard " ) was a very early [[dinosaur]] that lived during the [[ Upper Triassic]], a time when the [[Earth]] was relatively warm and much of the land was dry and [[desert]]-like. This was around the time that the dinosaurs were just starting to appear. 
 
 == Description == 
 Fossils of ''Thecodontosaurus'' have been found in southwest [[England]] (near [[Bristol]]) and [[Wales]]. ''Thecodontosaurus'' was first described by H. Riley and S. Stutchbury in 1836, and named by Morris in 1843.  
 
 Modern [[cladistic]] work has not been conclusive. ''Thecodontosaurus'' was earlier put under the [[Prosauropoda]]. < ref > Upchurch P. 1998. The phylogenetic relationships of sauropod dinosaurs. ''Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''124''': 43 & ndash;103 < /ref >  More recently was suggested that ''Thecodontosaurus'' and its relatives came before the prosauropod-sauropod split. < ref > Yates A.M.  &  Kitching J.W. 2003. The earliest known sauropod dinosaur and the first steps towards sauropod locomotion. ''Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond.: B Biol Sci.'' '''270''' (1525): 1753 & ndash;8 < /ref >  ''Thecodontosaurus'' is in a [[basal]] position among the [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]] dinosaurs. New reconstructions show that its neck is proportionally shorter than those in more '[[advanced]]' sauropodomorphs.
