 A '''farm''' is a piece of [[land]] used to grow [[crop]]s  and/or [[Animal husbandry|raise animal]]s. 
 
 People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called [[farmer]]s. This work is called [[farming]]. 
 
 Land that is used to grow plants is called farmland.  Land that is used to feed animals with its grass is called [[pasture]].  Land that can be used to grow plants for food is called [[arable land]]. 
 
 Many farms are very large and can cause damage.  In some places farms are many and small, and can also cause damage.  Farms provides most of the food for people.  Some people farm to eat the food they produce ([[subsistence agriculture]]). Other farms, including large ones, sell their [[Product (consumer goods)|product]]s to markets far away in [[urban area]]s (commercial or industrial farming). Most subsistence farms are in poorer countries, while industrial farms are in richer countries.
