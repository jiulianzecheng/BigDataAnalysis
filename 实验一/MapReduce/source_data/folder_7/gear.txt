 '''Gears''' are [[machine|mechanical]] parts with cut teeth designed to fit with teeth on another part or gear so as to transmit or receive [[Force (physics)|force]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]]. Gears are also sometimes called toothed wheels or cogged wheels or cogs.  The cut teeth are also sometimes called [[cog]]s. 
 
 Numerous nonferrous [[alloy]]s, [[cast iron]]s, powder-metallurgy and even [[plastic]]s are used in the manufacture of gears. However [[steel]]s are most commonly used because of their high [[strength]] to weight ratio and high cost.
