Singers may sing anything: [[song]]s, [[opera]], etc. They may be [[accompaniment (music)|accompanied]] by an [[musical instrument|instrument]] or an [[orchestra]].

 == Qualities == 
 A good singer will have to think of a lot of different things in a performance. Some attributes of singing skill are good vocal technique, a large [[vocal range]], as well as ''feeling the song'' through [[emotion]]al language and breathing, and also [[acting]] to provide a song with meaning. A good singer may be able to learn a song quickly, but it may take some time before they really feel it has become  " part of them. "  A lead singer has to be a strong singer since background vocalists sing accompaniment. < ref > Rachel L.
