 The '''nyala''' (''Nyala angasii'' or ''Tragelaphus angasii''), also called '''inyala''', < ref > H A Bryden; A J Arnold; et al, ''Great and Small Game of Africa: An Account of the Distribution, Habits, and Natural History of the Sporting Mammals, with Personal Hunting Experiences'' (London: R. Ward, 1899), p. 455 < /ref >  is an [[antelope]] that lives in [[southern Africa]]. It has the highest [[sexual dimorphism]] among other spiral-horned antelopes. 
 
 The nyala is mainly active early in the morning and late in the afternoon. As a [[herbivore]], the nyala eats [[leaves]], [[fruit]]s and [[grass]]es. They prefer water holes rather than open spaces. The nyala is not a territorial animal. Family groups of up to 10 individuals can be found. Old males live alone but family groups of up to ten members live in thickets within dense and dry [[savanna]] woodlands. The main [[predator]]s of the nyala are [[lion]], [[leopard]] and [[African wild dog|Cape hunting dog]], while [[baboon|baboons]] and [[bird of prey|raptors]] hunt for the young. Mating peaks during spring and autumn. 
 
 Nyalas live in [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. They have been introduced to [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]], and reintroduced to [[Swaziland]], where they became [[extinction|extinct]] in the 1950s. Populations are stable and are of [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The main threats to the species are [[poaching]] and [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]] resulting from [[human settlement]]. The males are highly demanded as [[game (food)|game animals]] in Africa.
