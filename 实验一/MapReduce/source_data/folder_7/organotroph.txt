An '''organotroph''' is an [[organism]] that lives off [[organic compound]]s. It is a word used in [[microbiology]] to describe organisms based on how they get [[electron]]s for [[respiration]] (breathing). Some organotrophs are also [[heterotroph]]s. Organotrophs may or may not need [[oxygen]] in order to grow.
