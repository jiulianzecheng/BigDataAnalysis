 Originally, '''Fondue''' was a dish where pieces of [[bread]], [[potato]]es, or other [[vegetable]]s were dipped into hot, molten [[cheese]]. Fondue is common in [[Switzerland]], [[Piedmont]], and [[Savoie]]. With the time, the meaning of fondue was extended: With [[Fondue bourguinonne]], pieces of meat (usually [[beef]]) are dipped into hot [[Vegetable oil|oil]]. Fondue chinoise uses stripes of meat which are cooked. 
 
 Fondue chinoise and Fondue bouriginonne are served with different sauces or dips. The cheese-based variety uses a mixture of [[cheese]], [[white wine]], and [[starch]] to prepare the molten cheese. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 A great number of people believe that fondue is a very old country way to make food of hard cheese and hard bread. Both Swiss and French people make fondue from the old time. It is most likely first made in the [[Jura mountains]]. 
 
 The oldest certain directions for making fondue used [[egg (food)|eggs]] and came from [[Vaud]] in the early [[19th century]]. A great number of Swiss places and towns came up with very special directions for making fondue based on cheeses, wines and other substances of the town.  
 
 Fondue became pleasing to a great number of people in the [[United States]] through the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 
 [[Image:Full cheese fondue set - in Switzerland.JPG|thumb|right|A full cheese fondue group in Switzerland.]] 
 
 In addition to the bread and cheese, there are side plates of [[garlic]], [[pickled cucumber]], [[onions]] and [[olive (fruit)|olives]]. 
 
 To give a special quality of taste, the ''caquelon'' is first rubbed with a cut [[garlic]]. Wine and cheese are added and heated and moved till they are warm and liquid. A small amount of [[Starch#Starch in food|starch]] is added to join the substances. Some strong alcohol from [[cherry|cherries]] is added just before bringing it to the table. 
 
 The most common directions use 1 [[decilitre]] of dry white wine and 200 [[gram]]s of cheese for every person. The cheese is a mix of hard cheese (such as ''Gruy√®re'') and semi-hard (such as [[Emmental cheese]]). 
 
 ===Temperature and ''La Religieuse''=== 
 
 A cheese fondue would be kept at a [[temperature]] warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not at a great heat to cause burning.  
 
 If the temperature is good, there will be a thin hard cover of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the lowest part of the ''caquelon''.  
 
 This is the ''la religieuse'' (French for ''the [[nun]]''). It has the structure of a thin [[cracker]] and is lifted out and every person is given a bit. In Switzerland sometimes boys and girls fight over the burnt cheese at the lowest part of the ''caquelon''. 
 
 ==Other fondues== 
 
 [[Image:Meat fondue.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Fondue Bourguignonne'': At top is a pot of oil for quickly cooking the meat, at middle a caquelon for a further cheese fondue and at lowest more sauces.]] 
 
 ''Fondue Bourguignonne'' is named after Burgundy in France. Fondue Bourguignonne uses a pot of heated oil to cook. Bits of meat are put into the oil to quickly cook them. A number of sauces are made ready on the side. The earliest statements of this dish seem to have been made in the 1950s. < ref > In Google Books the term ''Fondue Bourguignonne'' is first used in a book from 1957. In Google News the earliest reference is one from 1958. < /ref > 
 
 ''Fondue Chinoise'' uses a pot of heated liquid to cook. Thin bits of meat (often beef) are put into a very warm thin meat soup. As with a Fondue Bourguignonne, a number of sauces are made ready on the side. At the end of the meal, the liquid from the pot is drunk as a thick soup. 
 
 ''Chocolate Fondue'' was first made in the 1960s. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.meltwaterchocolatefondue.com/the-history-of-chocolate-fondue.html |title=The History of Chocolate Fondue |access-date=2010-12-08 |archive-date=2010-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614001841/http://www.meltwaterchocolatefondue.com/the-history-of-chocolate-fondue.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Slices of [[fruit]] or [[cake]] are put in a pot of warm, liquid [[chocolate]]. 
 
 ==Good behavior== 
 
 It would not be good to touch the fork with the tongue, because the fork will go back into the common pot. At a meat fondue, one uses a second fork to take meat off the fork that goes into the common pot.  
 
 In Switzerland what has been done for a long time, is that if a bit of bread is lost in the cheese by a man, he gives money for a bottle of wine. If it is lost by a woman, she kisses the man at her left. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.gofondue.com/fondue_101.htm |title=Fondue 101 Guide |access-date=2010-12-08 |archive-date=2010-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217211923/http://gofondue.com/fondue_101.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.digsmagazine.com/host/host_fondue4.htm DigsMagazine.com:  " How to have a fondue party " ] < /ref >
