 '''Anomalopidae''' ('''lanterneye fishes''' or '''flashlight fishes''') are a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[fish]]. They have [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] under their eyes. These light organs contain glowing [[bacteria]]. They can be  " shut off "  by the fish. It does this by either using a dark lid or by being drawn into a pouch. The organs are used to [[Communication|communicate]], [[Hunting|attract prey]] and evade [[Predation|predators]]. 
 
 Flashlight fish are found in [[Tropics|tropical]] [[ocean]] waters across the world. They are normally about {{cvt|14|cm|in}} in size. Some [[species]] can be twice this length. They are [[Nocturnal animals|nocturnal]]. The fish feed at night on small [[Crustacean|crustaceans]]. Some species move to shallow waters near [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] at night. Most species are deep water fish. This tends to make research of the family difficult. They are a poorly understood group of fish.
