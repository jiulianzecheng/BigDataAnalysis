 A '''catenary''' is a type of [[curve]]. An ideal [[chain]] hanging between two supports and acted on by a uniform [[Gravity|gravitational force]] makes the shape of a catenary. < ref name= " wolfram " > {{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Catenary.html|title=Catenary|publisher=Wolfram Research|access-date=2016-10-30}} < /ref >  (An ideal chain is one that can bend perfectly, cannot be stretched and has the same [[density]] throughout. < ref name= " csu " > {{cite web|url=http://web.calstatela.edu/curvebank/catenary/catenary.htm|title=The Catenary - The  " Chain "  Curve|publisher=California State University|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-date=2017-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630204710/http://web.calstatela.edu/curvebank/catenary/catenary.htm|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > ) The supports can be at different heights and the shape will still be a catenary. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://people.math.aau.dk/~br/catenary.pdf|title=Catenary|first=Bo|last=Rosbjerg|publisher=Aalborg University|access-date=2016-10-30}} < /ref >  A catenary looks a bit like a [[parabola]], but they are different. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/65729.html|title=Catenary and Parabola Comparison|publisher=Drexel University|access-date=2016-11-05}} < /ref >

 where  < math > a < /math >  is a [[parameter]] that determines the shape of the catenary < ref name= " math24 "  / >  and  < math > \cosh < /math >  is the [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic cosine]] function, which is defined as < ref name= " stroud "  / > 
 :  < math >  \cosh x = \frac {e^x + e^{-x}} {2} < /math > . 
 Hence, we can also write the catenary equation as 
 :  < math >  y = \frac{a\left(e^\frac{x}{a} + e^{-\frac{x}{a}}\right)}{2} < /math > . 
 
 The word  " catenary "  comes from the [[Latin]] word ''catena'', which means  " chain " . < ref name= " stroud " > {{cite book|first1=K.
