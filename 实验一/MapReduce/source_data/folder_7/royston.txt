'''Royston''' is a town near the [[A 505 road]] in [[North Hertfordshire]], [[Hertfordshire]], England. In 2001 there were 14,570 people living in Royston. Royston is a very historic town as it has the meridian of time running through it. We also have the Roy stone. Royston was originally called Roysia but the arrival of the stone  lead to a change of the towns name. There is also a historic cave which is imagined to be a religious work as it has a lot of religious images around it. There are many schools in Royston including Roysia, Greneway and Meridian which are called Rsat (Royston Schools Academy Trust) These three schools are about to link together to become one.
