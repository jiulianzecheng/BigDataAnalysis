 The '''teratorns'''  < ref > from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Τερατορνις ''Teratornis'', '[[monster]] bird' < /ref >  were a group of very large [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] that lived in the [[Americas]] from the [[Oligocene]] to [[Pleistocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epochs]]. They are all [[extinct]] now. They include some of the largest known flying birds. So far, at least five species in four genera have been identified: 
 
 Teratornithidae are related to [[New World vulture]]s (''Cathartidae'', [[Synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]] ''Vulturidae''). < ref name=Chatterjee07 > Chatterjee, Sankar ''et al'' 2007.

''University of California Publications, Bulletin of the Department of Geology'' '''5''': 305–317. < /ref >  This is by far the best-known species. Over a hundred specimens have been found, mostly from [[La Brea tar pits]]. It stood about 75 & nbsp;cm (29.5 & nbsp;in) tall with estimated wingspan of perhaps 3.5 to 3.8 metres (11.5 to 12.5 & nbsp;ft), and weighed about 15 & nbsp;kg (33 & nbsp;lb); making it about a third bigger than living condors. It became extinct at the end of the [[Pleistocene]], some 10,000 years ago.

Calif. Acad. Sci''. '''51''': 50–54. [http://biostor.org/reference/97415] < /ref >  A partial skeleton of this enormous teratorn was found from [[La Pampa]], [[Argentina]]. It is the largest flying bird known to have existed. It is the oldest known teratorn, dating to late [[Miocene]], about 6 to 8 million years ago, and one of the very few teratorn finds in [[South America]]. Initial discovery included portions of the skull, incomplete humerus and several other wing bones. Even conservative estimates put its wingspan at 6 meters and up (some 20 & nbsp;ft), and it may have been as much as 8 metres (26 & nbsp;ft). The weight of the bird was estimated to have been around 80 & nbsp;kg (176 & nbsp;lb). 
 
 This group of huge birds lived at a time before mankind reached the Americas in any numbers. The land was more heavily forested than today, and so had herbivores more suited to forests than today. The finds in California suggest that similar conditions existed in much of California and North America west of the mountains.
