 A '''pier''' is a raised walkway across water. It can be a simple light wooden structure which has no effect on the current and tides, or a major structure with buildings and as long as a mile out to sea. In the [[United States]], these may be referred to as [[dock]]s. A pier can be made of wood, [[concrete]], or other materials.
