 '''Sanchi Stupa''' is a memorial built in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] in the city of Sanchi in [[India]]. It is located  {{convert|46|km}} north-east of [[Bhopal]], capital of Madhya Pradesh. The Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India. It is an important [[monument]] of Indian Architecture. < ref > [http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art] Frontline Magazine May 13â€“26, 1989 < /ref >  The emperor [[Ashoka]] ordered it to be built,in the 3rd century BCE. Its center was a simple [[dome]]-like [[brick]] structure built over the [[Relic|relics]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. It was crowned by the ''chatra'', a [[Umbrella|parasol]]-like structure symbolising high rank. This structure was intended  to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby [[Vidisha]]. Sanchi was Devi's birthplace as well as the place of her wedding with Ashoka. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved [[Torana|toranas]] (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.
