 '''Artillery''' is a word for the big [[gun]]s used in an [[army]], for example [[cannon]]s and [[howitzer]]s. Such guns are used to shoot targets far away. Artillery is often used to stop enemy troops using an area, to [[bombardment|bombard]] [[trench|trenches]] and buildings with enemies in it and to support friendly units. There are many different weapons that are called artillery. They may shoot [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] or [[missile|missiles]]. Newer systems can even drop [[Land mine|mines]] over a big area, making the area uncrossable. [[Anti-aircraft warfare]] includes the use of artillery to fight planes and other [[aircraft]].   
 
 Those who fire the artillery piece are called  " gunners " . In most cases someone else, called a  " spotter "  must see the enemy, because artillery often shoots farther than the gunners can see. The artillery crews do not have to see the enemy to damage them.
