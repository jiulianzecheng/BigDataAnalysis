'''Pseudepigrapha''' (pseudo = false; graphe = writing) are falsely [[attributed]] works. They are written works not by their supposed [[author]]. 
 
 They include [[Old Testament]] works not included in the [[Bible]]. They were a group of early writings which were not included in the  Bible, or the [[Apocrypha]].  Most were falsely ascribed to biblical characters. 
 
 These are [[Jewish]] religious works thought to be written about 300 [[BC]] to 300 [[AD]]. They are distinguished by [[Protestants]] from the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] ([[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox]]) or [[Apocrypha]] (Protestant). These books appear in the [[Septuagint]] and [[Vulgate]] but not in the [[Hebrew Bible]] or in Protestant bibles. < ref name = " Harris " > Harris, Stephen L. 1985. ''Understanding the Bible''.
