 A '''halo''' is a ring of [[light]] that surrounds an object. Also, in much religious art, it may be seen surrounding the heads of [[saint]]ly people such as [[Jesus]]. 
 
 It is believed by some [[Hinduism|Hindus]] that the halo shown around the heads of holy people is a depiction of their   " activated "  crown chakra. 
 
 Halos are visual [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that appear near or around the [[Sun]] or [[Moon]], and sometimes near other strong light sources such as street lights. There are many types of optical halos, but they are mostly caused by ice crystals in certain types of [[cloud]]s. The shape of the crystals changes the type of halo seen. Light is reflected by the ice and may split into colors, similar to the rainbow.
