 In 577 the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] claims the kings of the Gewisse captured [[Cirencester]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Gloucester]]. < ref name=Edwards381 > T. M. Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons, 350-1064'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 381 < /ref >  The date is questionable but the Gewisse did hold those territories. < ref name=Edwards381/ >  The Gewisse found themselves limited in their ability to expand into new territories by the growing power of [[Mercia]]. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils and Cwichelm his son 'fought with [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]] at [[Cirencester]] and came to an agreement with him there'. < ref > Benjamin Thorpe, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle according to the Several Original Authorities: Translation'' (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1861), p. 21 < /ref >  The 'agreement' meant giving Cirencester to Penda. < ref name=Stenton45 > Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 45 < /ref >  It was a [[:wikt:permanent|permanent]] loss of Cirencester. < ref name= " Peter Hunter Blair 1966 p. 206 " > Peter Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain and Early England; 55 B.C.–A.D. 871'' (New York; London: W.

The change in name to Wessex may have reflected more a change in their territory. < ref name=Walker183/ > 
 
 Bishop [[Birinus]] began converting the Gewisse to [[Christianity]] in 634, In 635 he baptized their king [[Cynegils of Wessex|Cynegils]] who established Birinus at [[Dorchester]]. < ref name= " Peter Hunter Blair 1966 p. 206 " / >  But the Dorchester bishopric was never considered West Saxon by Bede. < ref name=Walker183/ >  He considered it to be Gewisse. In 660 [[Cenwalh of Wessex|Cenwalh]] created a new [[diocese]] at Winchester and made [[Wine (bishop)|Wine]] the first bishop. Bede referred to the Winchester diocese as West Saxon. < ref name=Walker183/ >  At the time he was writing in the early [[8th century]], Bede treated the two names as interchangeable. < ref name=Kirby38 > D. P. Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'' (London; New York: Routledge, 2000), p. 38 < /ref >  But when writing of the reign of Cynegils he referred to them as  " anciently known as the Gewissae.
