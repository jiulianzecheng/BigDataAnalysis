 '''Skylab''' was the first [[space station]] of the [[United States]]. It was launched on May 14, 1973 on an extra [[Saturn V]] [[Moon]] [[rocket]]. It was launched without the third stage, lunar module, or command/service module because Skylab was itself an extra third stage that was turned into a space station, which is called a wet workshop. The Apollo [[spacecraft]] visited the station three times. If there was any problem, an Apollo spacecraft with [[Vance D. Brand]] and [[Don L. Lind]] could rescue the crews.
