 '''Ani''' ({{Lang-hy|Անի}}) is a ruined and uninhabited medieval city-site in [[Turkey]]. It is in the province of [[Kars Province|Kars]], beside the border with [[Armenia]]. It was once the capital of a [[medieval]] [[Armenian people|Armenian]] kingdom that covered much of present-day Armenia and eastern Turkey. 
 
 At the height of its great times, Ani had a population of 100,000 - 200,000 people and was the rival of [[Constantinople]], [[Baghdad]] and [[Cairo]]. Long ago renowned for its splendor and magnificence, Ani has been abandoned and largely forgotten for centuries. 
 
 == History == 
 Armenian chroniclers first mention Ani in the 5th century AD. They describe it as a strong fortress built on a hilltop and a possession of the Armenian [[Kamsarakan]] dynasty. 
   
 By the early 9th century the former territories of the Kamsarakans in Arsharunik and Shirak (including Ani) had been incorporated into the territories of the Armenian [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] dynasty. Their leader, [[Ashot Msaker|Ashot ''Msaker'']] (Ashot the Meateater) (806-827) was given the title of ''ishkhan'' (prince) of Armenia by the [[Caliphate]] in 804. 
 
 === Other monuments === 
 There are many other minor monuments at Ani. These include a convent known as the Virgins' chapel; a church used by [[Chalcedonian]] Armenians; the remains of a single-arched bridge over the Arpa river; the ruins of numerous oil-presses and several bath houses; the remains of a second mosque with a collapsed minaret; a palace that probably dates from the 13th century; the foundations of several other palaces and smaller residences; the recently excavated remains of several streets lined with shops; etc.
