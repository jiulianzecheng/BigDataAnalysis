 A '''monologue''' is a long, uninterrupted [[Oratory|speech]] or poem by one person. The person may be speaking his or her thoughts aloud or directly addressing other persons, e.g. an audience, a character, reader, or inanimate object. 
 
 The term 'dramatic monologue' is used both for [https://www.studyonline365.com/2023/02/most-important-dialogue-for-classes-6.html monologues] in plays and for the poetic genre. 
 
 ==Rant== 
 A '''rant''' (also called '''harangue''' or '''declamation''') is a monologue that does not present a well-researched and calm [[argument]]; rather, it is typically an attack on an [[idea]], a [[person]], or an [[institution]], and very often lacks [[Libel|proven claims]].   
 
 Some rants are used not to attack something, but to defend an individual, idea or organization. Rants of this type generally occur [[Quid pro quo|after the subject has been attacked]] by another individual or group. 
 
 Rants are used often in situations requiring monologue. Comedians, such as [[Lewis Black]], [[Adam Carolla]], and [[Rick Mercer]], use rants as a way to get their message or punch-line across to the listening audience. 
 
 For Example: When a politician gives a speech in a loud voice, he expresses his thoughts and feelings and the general public listens to it, the subject is monologue. 
 
 A rant can be used to [[Flaming (Internet)|flame]] members of an email group or [[electronic mailing list]] that are failing to reach a consensus on an issue.
