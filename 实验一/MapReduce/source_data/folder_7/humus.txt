 '''Humus''' (or '''humous''') is the [[organic matter]] in the [[soil]]. It is made of [[decomposition|dead]] parts of [[plant]]s and animals. Humus takes in water and has plenty of [[nutrients]]. [[Nitrogen]] is the most important. Plants put roots into the soil to get the water and nutrients. Humus is good for plants because it is like a [[sponge]]. 
 
 The dark colour of humus (usually black or dark brown) helps to warm up cold soils in the [[spring (season)|spring]]. 
 
 == How this happens == 
 When plants and [[insect]]s die they are first raw organic matter. [[Bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]] eat the raw material, but they do not eat all of it. They leave a small amount behind. The part they leave behind is named  " humus " . This activity is [[wikt:dynamic|dynamic]] and keeps happening. There is always more dead material arriving on top. So the soil always has organic material in it, along with small pieces of rock. 
 
 In [[agriculture]],  " humus "  usually means mature [[compost]], or some taken naturally from a [[forest]], where it may have lived for many years.
