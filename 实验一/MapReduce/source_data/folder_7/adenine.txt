 '''Adenine''' is one of the [[nucleobase]]s or basic [[molecule]]s which form [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. They are usually called '''bases''' in [[genetics]]. 
 
 ==Function== 
 In DNA, adenine sticks to [[thymine]] with two [[hydrogen bonds]] to help in making the nucleic acid structures stronger. In RNA, which is used in the [[cytoplasm]] for [[protein synthesis]], adenine sticks to [[uracil]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Adenine was sometimes called '''Vitamin B < small > 4 < /small > ''', but no longer. < ref > {{cite journal

 }} < /ref >  However, two B vitamins, [[niacin]] and [[riboflavin]], bind with adenine to form the essential [[cofactor]]s [[NAD]] and [[FAD]] respectively. 
 
 Adenine when bonded to [[ribose]] forms [[adenosine]], part of molecules such as [[adenosine triphosphate]]. 
 
 Some think that, at the [[origin of life]] on [[Earth]], the first adenine was formed by the [[polymerization]] (joining) of five [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) molecules. This is not generally accepted. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Robert|title=The prebiotic role of adenine: A critical analysis|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01581575|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|year=1995|volume=25|issue=1–3|pages=83–98|doi=10.1007/BF01581575|pmid=11536683|s2cid=21941930|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326121524/http://www.springerlink.com/content/ru56122875200030/|archive-date=2020-03-26|access-date=2007-09-21|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
