 '''Kauai''' ('''Kaua'i''' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is the second oldest (after [[Ni'ihau]]) and fourth largest of the main [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]]. Known also as the  " Garden Isle " , Kaua'i lies 73 miles (117 kilometers) across the Kauai Channel, northwest of [[Honolulu]] on [[Oahu]]. It is of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin. The highest point on the island is [[Kawaikini]]. It is located {{Convert|5,243|ft|m}} above sea level. The wettest spot on Earth, with average rainfall of {{Convert|460|in|mm}} a year, is just east of [[Mount Waialeale]]. The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys and canyons in the central mountain. The waterfalls that have been created by erosion in canyons are now popular tourist spots. 
 
 The city of [[Lihue, Hawaii|Lihue]], on the island's southeast side, is the seat of [[Kauai County, Hawaii|Kauai County]]. It has a population of around 6,500, and is the main city on the island. [[Waimea, Hawaii|Waimea]], which is located on the island's southwest side and the first capital of Kauai, was the first place visited by [[English people|English]] < nowiki/ > explorer Captain [[James Cook]] in [[1778]]. It was also the first capital of Kauai. The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world, [[Waimea Canyon]], whose gorge is 900 meters (3,000 feet) deep. 
 
 The island of Kauai was featured in Disney's [[2002]] [[animated feature film]] ''[[Lilo  &  Stitch]]''.
