 '''Diagonal''' is a kind of straight [[line]].  A diagonal line does not go straight up, down, or across. It is a line that connects two corners of a shape.     
 
 In [[mathematics]],  " diagonal "  has different meanings.  For example, in [[geometry]] a diagonal is any line that goes between the corners of a [[polygon]]. So a [[square (geometry)|square]] has two diagonals, and a [[pentagon|five-sided shape]] has five diagonals. In general the count of diagonal can be identified by a formula [n(n-3)]/2 where n is the total number of sides of shapes.
