 '''''Nyasasaurus''''' ( " [[Lake Nyasa]] lizard " ) is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of [[Archosaur]] [[reptile]] from the [[Middle Triassic]] [[Manda Beds]] of [[Tanzania]]. It may be the earliest known [[dinosaur]]. The discovery was a handful of bones from two individuals, so its anatomy is only partly known. The bones were collected in the early 1930s, but have only recently been analysed. 
 
 Researchers said:  " ''Nyasasaurus'' possesses a unique combination of dinosaur character states and an elevated growth rate similar to that of definitive early dinosaurs. It demonstrates that the initial dinosaur radiation occurred over a longer timescale than previously thought (possibly 15 million years earlier) " . < ref name=Nesbitt/ > 
 
 The find was six [[vertebra]]e and a [[humerus]] from one specimen, and five vertebrae from another. The humerus has a muscle attachment which is characteristic of dinosaurs (a long 'deltopectoral crest'). Other features are consistent with its being a basal dinosaur. < ref name=Nesbitt/ > 
 
 Previously, the oldest record of dinosaurs was from [[Argentina]] and dated back to the [[Upper Triassic]] [[Carnian]] stage, about 231.4 million years ago (mya). ''Nyasasaurus'' comes from a deposit that dates back to the Middle Triassic [[Anisian]] stage, meaning that it predates other early dinosaurs by about 15 million years. < ref name=Nesbitt > Nesbitt S.J.
