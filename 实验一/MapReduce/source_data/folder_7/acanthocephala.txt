 The '''Acanthocephala''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''akanthos'', thorn + ''kephale'', head) are a group of [[parasite|parasitic]] worms. They are modified [[rotifers]]. < ref name= " shimek " / > 
 
 They may be known as ''acanthocephales'', ''thorny-headed worms'', or ''spiny-headed worms''. They have an evertable [[proboscis]], < ref > This means: they keep the front part inside their body, until they push it out to pierce and hold the gut wall of their host. < /ref >  armed with [[spine]]s, which they use to pierce and hold the [[gut]] wall of the host. Acanthocephalans have no gut and absorb [[nutrient]]s directly from the hostâ€™s gut.   
 
 Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles, with various hosts, including [[invertebrate]]s, [[fish]]es, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s. The juveniles are parasitic in [[crustacea]]ns and [[insect]]s. Adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates, especially fish. About 1150 species have been described. < ref > Ronald Shimek [http://www.nhc.ed.ac.uk/index.php?page=24.25.333.372 Phylum Acanthocephala] < /ref > 
 
 The Acanthocephala were thought to be a separate [[phylum]]. Recent [[genome analysis]] has shown that they are closely related to [[rotifer]]s. Since all parasites are derived from free-living forms, the Acanthocephalans are modified rotifers. < ref name= " shimek " > {{cite web |url= http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2006-01/rs/index.php |author= Shimek, Ronald |access-date= 2022-01-02|title= Nano-Animals, Part I: Rotifers |publisher= Reefkeeping.com}} < /ref >  This is an example of [[molecule|molecular]] [[phylogenetics]]. In due course, spiny-headed worms will probably be placed in a taxonomic rank below phylum, such as sub-phylum or class. < ref > [http://www.iczn.org/ Official ICZN website]
