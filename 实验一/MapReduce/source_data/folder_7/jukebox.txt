 '''Jukeboxes''' are [[music]]al [[device]]s that play any selected [[song]] that is stored on it. They are partially automatic and usually operated by [[coin]]. The term ''jukebox'' came into use close to 1940, though in fact similar music devices were in use before that. The machines, however, have declined and been replaced by [[digital audio player]]s and [[Internet]] music.
