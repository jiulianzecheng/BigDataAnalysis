 '''Qubo''' (stylized as '''qubo''') was an [[United States|American]] children's entertainment brand owned by [[Ion Media]]. It included a 24-hour television channel available with an antenna, a [[video on demand]] service, and a weekly programming block on [[Ion Television]] under the name  " Qubo Kids Corner " , which was its sister network, along with the same block on another sister channel, [[Ion Plus]]. Qubo closed after Ion Media's [[acquisition]] by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]]. < ref > [https://scripps.com/press-releases/scripps-takes-first-steps-to-realize-ion-synergies-with-multicast-networks-move/ etworks-move/] < /ref > 
 
 Qubo began in September 2006. It was developed by several companies together, including Ion Media Networks, Corus Entertainment, [[Scholastic Corporation]], [[DreamWorks|Classic Media]], and [[NBC]]. It was to be a  " building block for kids "  (as stated by president Rick Rodriquez). Like Ion, Qubo would air blocks on NBC and in Spanish on [[Telemundo]]. This happened until 2012, when NBC was bought by the cable company [[Comcast]] and that company took off Qubo programming for a new block from [[Sprout (TV channel)|Sprout]], which Comcast already owned. Spanish audio was also available through a second audio program on the Qubo channel itself. It also had its shows on a website accessible on-demand. 
 
 Following Ion Media's acquisition by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]], it ceased operations on February 28, 2021. < ref name= " scripps.com " > {{cite press release|url=https://scripps.com/press-releases/scripps-takes-first-steps-to-realize-ion-synergies-with-multicast-networks-move/|title=Scripps takes first steps to realize ION synergies with multicast networks move|date=January 14, 2021|access-date=January 14, 2021|first=Carolyn|last=Micheli|publisher=[[The E.W.
