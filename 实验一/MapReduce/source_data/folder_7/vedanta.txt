 '''Vedanta''' is a school of [[Hindu philosophy]], one of the six recognized in [[Hinduism]]. The name means '' " end of the Vedas " .'' It is based on ideas found in the [[Upanishad|Upanishads]], focusing on knowledge and liberation. Vedanta has various schools that follow texts like the [[Upanishad|Upanishads]], Brahma Sutras, and [[Bhagavad Gita]]. The main Vedanta schools include Bhedabheda, [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]], Vishishtadvaita, Tattvavada (Dvaita), Suddhadvaita, and Achintya-Bheda-Abheda. Modern developments include Neo-Vedanta and the [[philosophy]] of the [[Swaminarayan|Swaminarayan Sampradaya]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|title=Vedanta {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/eastern-religions/hinduism/vedanta|access-date=2023-11-26|website=www.encyclopedia.com}} < /ref > < ref > King, Richard (2002).

 Most Vedanta schools, except [[Advaita Vedanta]] and Neo-Vedanta, are linked to [[Vaishnavism]], emphasizing devotion (Bhakti) to [[God]], often [[Vishnu]]. [[Advaita Vedanta]], in contrast, emphasizes Jnana (knowledge) and [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]]. While Advaita has gained attention in the West, other Vedanta traditions mainly focus on [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava theology]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >

 Most Vedanta schools, along with Samkhya, support Parinamavada, the idea that the world is a real transformation of [[Brahman]]. However, [[Advaita Vedanta]], led by [[Adi Shankara]], follows Vivartavada, stating that the world is an unreal transformation of [[Brahman]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / >
