 '''''Californosaurus''''' was an [[ichthyosaur]], an [[extinct]] [[Ocean|marine]] [[reptile]]. It was 10 feet (3 m) long. It had four paddle-shaped [[flipper]]s and sharp [[teeth]] in long, pointed jaws (looking a bit like a [[dolphin]]).  
 
 ''Californosaurus'' lived during the late [[Triassic]] period in seas that covered what is now [[California]]. It fed on fish and other small marine creatures. Like other ichthyosaurs it probably never came onto dry land, and gave birth in the water. 
 
 It is the most [[basal]] known true ichthyosaur, shaped more or less like a dolphin. The long-snouted head is small in comparison with the rest of the body, as in [[basal]] ichthyosaurs such as ''[[Mixosaurus]]'' and ''[[Cymbospondylus]]''. The tail is sharply turned downwards, in common with more [[advanced]] ichthyosaurs, with a small vertical fluke. It may have had a small dorsal [[fin]].
