 '''Samsara''' is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term, meaning the [[condition]]ed state of mind.  It is the cycle of ignorance, leading to disturbing emotions and clumsy actions.  They in turn are cause for suffering and new disturbing feelings and so on. According to Buddhaâ€™s teachings there are three main disturbing feelings: ignorance, anger and desire. They are called three poisons of mind and are told to have 84 000 [[combination]]s. The only way to completely get rid of suffering is to reach [[Nirvana]] or the perfect state of [[Buddha]]. All the teachings Buddha gives lead to this goal.  
 
 == The Six Realms== 
 There are six [[realm]]s of samsara, connected to six specific emotions: 
 *Hell or [[paranoia]] realm is connected with anger. 
 *[[Preta]] or hungry ghost realm is connected with greed. 
 *[[Animal]] realm is connected with ignorance. 
 *[[Human]] realm is connected with desire and attachment.
