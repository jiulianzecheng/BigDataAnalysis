'''Cellophane''' is a bio[[plastic]] wrapping material. It is a thin, [[transparent]] sheet made of [[cellulose]]. It has low [[permeability]]. That means very little [[air]], [[oil]]s, [[Petroleum|greases]], [[bacteria]], and [[water]] can get in. That makes it useful for food [[Container|packaging]]. 
 
 Cellophane was invented by [[Swiss]] [[chemist]] [[Jacques E. Brandenberger]]. < ref > {{cite book |last=Carraher |first= Charles E.

 It took ten years for Brandenberger to perfect his idea. He added [[glycerin]] to soften the material. By 1912 he had built a [[machine]] to make the film. He called the product  " Cellophane " , from the words ''cellulose'' and ''diaphane'' ( " transparent " ). Cellophane was patented that year. < ref > Carlisle, Rodney (2004).

 [[DuPont]] built the first cellophane [[manufacturing]] plant in the US. One of their chemists found a way to make it moisture proof. < ref > {{cite book | last = Winkler | first = John K. | title = The Dupont dynasty | publisher = Waverly Press, Inc | year = 1935 | location = Baltimore, MD | page = 271 }} < /ref >  The material became hugely popular. 
 
 " Cellophane "  is a general term in some countries, but in other countries it is a [[registered trademark]]. 
 
 Cellophane played a crucial role in developing the self-service retailing of fresh [[meat]]. The [[transparency]] helped customers see the quality of meat before buying. Cellophane also largely prevents discoloration of food. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/17-106_cc97c076-3685-4e40-80b8-9de7342b0aac.pdf|title=Cellophane, the new visuality, and the creation of self-service food retailing |last=Hisano|first=Ai|website=Harvard Business School}} < /ref >
