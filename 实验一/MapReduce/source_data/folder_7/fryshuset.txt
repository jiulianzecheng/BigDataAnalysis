 '''Fryshuset''' is a Swedish community service organization. It is a school and business. It helps all young people to make the world better through their interests. Fryshuset leads activities for young people in four areas: School, Youth Culture, Work  &  Business starting, and Example  &  Faith in the Future. Fryshuset helps all young people. It focuses mostly on those who live by themselves. 
 
 == History == 
 Fryshuset started in the fall of 1984 in a worn-out freezer warehouse in Norra Hammarbyhamnen in [[Stockholm]]. The passionate Anders Carlberg was tasked by YMCA Söder to find a room that could function as a basketball hall and gather all the children and young people in Söder who wanted to play basketball. The old freezer warehouse was empty and they began to renovate and build a sports hall.
