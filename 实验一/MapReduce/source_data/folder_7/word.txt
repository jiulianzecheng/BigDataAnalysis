 A '''word''' is something spoken by the [[mouth]], that can be pronounced. Also, words are using in [[writing]]. In [[alphabet]]ic writing, a word is a collection of [[letter]]s. The word then communicates a meaning. These can also usually be pronounced. A [[logogram]] is also a word. 
 
 Some words have more than one [[meaning]], for example 'spring' can refer to the season, the [[Spring (device)|device]], or a [[conjugation]] of the verb. These are [[homonym]]s. Some words have different [[pronunciation]], for example, 'wind' (the noun) and 'wind' (the verb) are pronounced differently.  
 
 Some words have different [[spelling]] - for example 'color' and 'colour', which are both correct. ‘Color' is used in [[American English]] and ‘colour' is used in [[British English]]. Some words can be only one letter, for example  " a "  and  " I "  in [[English language|English]]. Besides English, all other [[language]]s have their own words. When written with an alphabet, words are usually separated by a space. When written with [[ideogram]] < nowiki/ > s, each word is usually a separate symbol. 
 
 Words can be invented. This is called [[neologism]]. For example, [[radar]] was originally an [[acronym]] but became an actual word. Two words may be joined to make a [[compound word]]. 
 
 == Fuller definition == 
 A word is the smallest thing which can be said ''with meaning''. For example, ''[[hello]]'' is a word. 
 
 This contrasts with a [[morpheme]], which is the smallest unit of meaning but may not stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: ''oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect''), or several (''rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected''), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just given, these are ''-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed''). 
 
 The meaning of a word can be found in a [[dictionary]].
