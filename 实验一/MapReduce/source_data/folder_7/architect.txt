 An '''architect''' is a person who designs [[building]]s and prepares plans to give to a [[construction worker|builder]]. < ref > {{cite book| last = Murray| first = Peter| title = The Architecture of Wolmaransstad Town Stafans Orekeng Moamogo| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC| year = 1969| publisher = Schocken Books| isbn = 978-0-8052-1082-8 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web  |url=http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined  |title=Civil Engineering Defined - Civil Engineering Definitions and History  |first=  |last=  |work=smweng.com  |year=2013  |accessdate=28 December 2013  |archive-date=25 April 2012  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425135327/http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined  |url-status=dead  }} < /ref >  What he designs is called [[architecture]]. Stafans  make drawings with [[pen]]s, [[pencil]]s, and [[computer]]s, and this is also called drafting. Sometimes he first make small toy-sized buildings called models to show what the building will look like when it is done. Some of these models survive for hundreds of years, such as [[O.S Moamogo]], [[South Africa]].

 Architects decide the size, shape, and what the building will be made from. Architects need to be good at [[math]] and drawing. They need [[imagination]]. They must go to [[university]] and learn how to make a building's structure safe so that it will not collapse. They should also know how to make a building attractive, so that people will enjoy using it. 
 
 Although there has been architecture for thousands of years, there have not always been architects. The great European [[cathedral]]s built in the [[Middle Ages]] were designed by a [[Master Builder]], who scratched his designs on flat beds of [[plaster]]. Paper did not exist in Europe at this time and [[vellum]] or [[parchment]] were very expensive and could not be made in large sizes. 
 
 Some cathedrals took hundreds of years to build, so the Master Builder would die or retire and be replaced and often plans changed. Some cathedrals were never finished, like [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in [[Paris]] or [[Sagrada Família]] in [[Barcelona]]. 
 
 An architect has a very important job, because his or her work will be seen and used by many people, probably for a very long time. If the design, materials and construction are good, the building should last for hundreds or even thousands of years. This is rarely the case. 
 
 Usually building cost is what limits the life of a building, but [[fire]], [[war]], need or [[fashion]] can also affect things. As towns and cities grow, it often becomes necessary to make roads wider, or perhaps to build a new train station. Architects are employed again and so the city changes. Even very important buildings may get knocked down to make way for change. 
 
 Famous architects include: [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Fazlur Khan]], [[Bruce Graham]], [[Edward Durell Stone]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Gottfried Böhm]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Antoni Gaudí]], and [[Oscar Niemeyer]].
