'''Republicanism''' is the [[ideology]] of governing a [[nation]] as a [[republic]] with an emphasis on [[liberty]] and the [[civic virtue]] practiced by [[citizen]]s.  Republicanism always stands in opposition to [[aristocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[monarchy]], and [[dictatorship]]. More broadly, it refers to a [[politics|political system]] that protects [[liberty]], especially by incorporating a [[rule of law]] that cannot be arbitrarily ignored by the government. 
 
 == United States == 
 According to [[John Adams]], “They define a [[republic]] to be a [[government]] of [[law]]s, and not of men.” Much of the [[literature]] deals with the issue of what sort of values and behavior by the citizens is necessary if the [[republic]] is to survive and flourish; the emphasis has been on widespread citizen participation, [[civic virtue]], and opposition to [[corruption]]. 
 
 == Commonwealth Realms == 
 Many [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realms]] (countries which have the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarch]] as their [[head of state]]) have political movements to become republics. For example, the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|Prime Minister]] of [[Jamaica]] said that it will become a republic by [[2025]]. In [[1999]], [[Australia]] had a vote to decide whether or not to keep the monarchy. The result was a majority supporting the monarchy.
