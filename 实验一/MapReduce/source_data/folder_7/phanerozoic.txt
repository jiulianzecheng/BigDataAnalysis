The '''Phanerozoic''' [[eon]] is the current eon on the [[Historical geology#Table of geologic time|geologic timescale]]. It is the one in which abundant animal life has existed. It covers about 541 million years, and goes back to the time when hard-shelled animals first appeared. It was once thought that life began in the [[Cambrian]], the first [[Period (geology)|period]] of this eon.  
 
 The time before the Phanerozoic, formerly called the ''[[Precambrian]]'', is now divided into the [[Hadean]], [[Archaean]] and [[Proterozoic]] eons.

 The exact time of the boundary between the Phanerozoic and the Proterozoic is slightly uncertain. In the 19th century, the boundary was set at the first abundant [[metazoa]]n [[fossil]]s. But several hundred kinds of [[Proterozoic]] [[metazoa]] have been discovered in the [[Ediacaran]]. Study of the [[Ediacaran biota]] started in the 1950s. There are three dividing points at the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary. It might be where the first [[trilobite]]s and [[archaeocyatha]] appear; or at the first appearance of signs of burrowing; or at the first appearance of the '[[small shelly fauna]]'. The three different dividing points are within a few million years of each other.

 During the period covered, [[continent]]s drifted about, eventually collecting into a single landmass known as [[Pangea]] and then splitting up into the current continental landmasses. 
 
 The Phanerozoic is divided into three [[era]]s: the [[Palaeozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cainozoic]].
