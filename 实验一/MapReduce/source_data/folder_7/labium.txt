 '''Labium''' (plural ''labia'') is a [[Latin]]-derived term meaning  " [[Lip]] " . ''Labium'' and its derivatives (including '''labia''', labial, [[labrum]] and ''labellum'') are used to describe any lip-like structure, but in the [[English language]], ''labium'' often specifically refers to parts of the [[vulva]]. 
 
 A variant of the word, ''labellum'' (plural: ''labella''), is used by people studying [[entomology]] and [[botany]]. < ref > Khoshoo, T.N.  &  Guha, I. ''Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Cannas.''
