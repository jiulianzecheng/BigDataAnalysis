 '''''Doedicurus''''' was an ancient [[armadillo]] are belonging to the family [[Glyptodontidae]]. Fossils have been found in [[Patagonia]], in [[South America]]. These herbivores (plant-eaters) may have been preyed upon by [[saber-toothed cat]]s and [[borhyaenid]]s (extinct [[dog]]-like meat-eaters). ''Doedicurus'' lived during the [[Ice Age]]s, during the [[Pleistocene]] between 2 million and 15,000 years ago.
