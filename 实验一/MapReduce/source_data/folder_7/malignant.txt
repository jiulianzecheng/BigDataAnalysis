 In [[medicine]], '''malignant''' is a clinical word that is used to describe an illness that kills a patient fast. A malignant tumor is a tumor that is able to invade nearby [[tissues]] and spread to tissues that are not nearby.  Not all patients [[medical diagnosis|diagnosed]] with malignant tumors die, because of the improved treatments available.  The actual [[prognosis]] depends on the type of tumor, its differentiation, and how bad the disease is.  The term malignant is typically applied to [[neoplasm]]s that show aggressive behavior characterized by local invasion or distant [[metastasis]].
