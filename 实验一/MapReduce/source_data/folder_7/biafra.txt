Odumegwu Ojukwu]]. It claimed the land of the [[Eastern Region (Nigeria)|Eastern Region]] of [[Nigeria]]. The country was mainly populated by the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] people. 
 
 Biafra was officially [[Diplomatic recognition|recognised]] by [[Gabon]], [[Haiti]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Zambia]]. < ref > [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2198977  " Was  " Biafra "  at Any Time A State in International Law?

 Biafra also had aid from [[non-state actors]], including Joint Church Aid, foreign [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and the Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland. 
 
 The [[United States]] government under [[President of the United States|president]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was officially neutral during the war. There was strong public support for Biafra in the US. < ref > [https://www.cfr.org/blog/fifty-years-later-us-intelligence-shortcomings-nigerian-civil-war  " Fifty Years Later: U.S. Intelligence Shortcomings in the Nigerian Civil War " ] < /ref >  American activists founded the American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive to spread [[propaganda]]. < ref > [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623528.2014.936723?cookieSet=1  " 'And starvation is the grim reaper': the American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive and the genocide question during the Nigerian civil war, 1968–70 " ] < /ref >  United States president Richard Nixon was supportive of the Biafran cause. Before he won the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]] he accused Nigeria of committing [[genocide]] against the Biafrans. He also called for the United States to intervene in the war on the side of Biafra. His efforts failed because of the demands of the ongoing [[Vietnam War]]. After two-and-a-half years of war with Nigeria, during which almost two million Biafran [[Civilian|civilians]] (three-quarters of them being smaller children) died from [[starvation]] caused by the Nigerian [[blockade]] of the region.

 An early body created by the Biafran government was the Bank of Biafra, made under  " Decree No. 3 of 1967 " . < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2008-08-27|title=The Banknotes of Biafra|url=http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/biafra.htm|access-date=2023-07-12|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2008-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827224301/http://www.pjsymes.com.au/articles/biafra.htm|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >   The [[bank]] carried out all central banking functions including the management of foreign exchange and the management of Biafra's public [[debt]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  The bank was managed by a [[governor]] and four directors. The first governor was Sylvester Ugoh. < ref > [http://allafrica.com/stories/201102280439.html  " Nigeria: The men who may be President (1) " ] < /ref >  A second degree,  " Decree No. 4 of 1967 " , changed the Banking Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the Republic of Biafra. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 The bank was originally in Enugu but because of the [[Nigerian Civil War]] it had to be moved multiple times. < ref name= " :0 "  / >   Biafra tried to finance the war through [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]]. This effort increased when Nigeria said that its [[currency]] wouldn't be [[legal tender]] (to make way for a new currency).
