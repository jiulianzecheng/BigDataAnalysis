 The '''Placozoa''' are an [[animal]] [[phylum]], a primitive form of [[invertebrate]]. < ref > Barnes, Robert D. 1982. ''Invertebrate zoology''. Holt-Saunders, Philadelphia, PA. p84 {{ISBN|0-03-056747-5}}. < /ref >  They are the simplest in structure of all [[metazoa]]. 
 
 The Placozoa is usually considered to have only one [[species]], '''''Trichoplax adhaerens''''', but there is enough [[genetic]] diversity that it is possible that there are multiple, morphologically similar species. < ref > {{cite journal | last=Voigt O | display-authors=etal | title=Placozoa: no longer a phylum of one | journal=Current Biology | volume=14 | pages=R944–5 | date=2004 | issue=22 | pmid=15556848 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.10.036 | s2cid=11539852 }} < /ref > 
 
 Although they were first discovered in 1883, a common name does not exist for the taxon. The scientific name literally means  " flat animals " . < ref > {{cite book|language=de|author=Rüdiger Wehner  &  Walter Gehring | title=Zoologie|edition=24th|publisher=Thieme|location= Stuttgart|date=2007|page=696}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Trichoplax'' is a small, flattened, animal around a millimetre across. Like an [[Amoeba]], it has no regular outline, although the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of simple [[epithelium]] enclosing a loose sheet of cells. The epithelial cells bear [[flagella]], which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor. < ref > [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/phyla/placozoa/placozoa.html UC Berkeley: Introduction to Placozoa ] < /ref >  Between these layers is the fiber [[syncytium]], a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibers. 
 
 ''Trichoplax'' feed by absorbing food particles—mainly [[microbe]]s—with their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though ''Trichoplax'' has a small [[genome]] in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 protein-coding [[gene]]s are similar to known genes in other animals. 
 
 In the 1960s and 1970s renewed interest among researchers led to the discovery that the animals people had been studying are adults, not larvae.  This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature (as opposed to [[aquarium]]s). < ref > Syed T. and Schierwater B. 2002.

 ==Ethymology== 
 Combining greek  " ''Plakoeis'' "  and  " ''Zoea'' "  makes the ethymological origin of ''[[Placozoa]]''.{{fact|date=August 2023}}
