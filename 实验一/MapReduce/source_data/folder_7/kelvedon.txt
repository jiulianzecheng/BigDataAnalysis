 The present village of Kelvedon has been lived in since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The building of the [[Norwich]] - [[London]] railway, made Kelvedon a good place to live, but with easy and quick access to London. The village was built along one road, High Street. From the 1930's the village began to spread for miles along the street which was part of the A12. In the 1960's a [[bypass]] was built to go around the village. In the 1980's a large housing development called  " Riverside Park "  added hundreds of houses.
