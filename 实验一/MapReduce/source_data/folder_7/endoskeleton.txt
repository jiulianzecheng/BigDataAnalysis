 An '''endoskeleton''' is a structure that holds an [[animal]] from inside.  
 
 One can find endoskeletons in three [[phylum|phyla]] and one [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of animals: in [[Chordata]], [[Echinoderm]]ata, [[Porifera]] and [[Coleoidea]]. An endoskeleton allows the body to move and gives the body structure and shape.  
 
 A true endoskeleton develops from [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesodermal]] [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]]. Such a [[skeleton]] is present in echinoderms and chordates. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; here, a [[mollusc]] [[exoskeleton]] [[evolution|developed]] into several sorts of internal structure, the  " cuttlebone "  of [[cuttlefish]] being the best-known version. An important advantage of an endoskeleton over an exoskeleton is that the endoskeleton provides more structural support. 
 Endoskeletons hold inner organs, tissues, and systems together easily.
