The term  " '''mileage''' "  refers to distance traveled. It often refers to distance per unit of [[fuel]], such as '''miles per gallon''' (mpg) or '''litres per 100 kilometres''' (L/100 km). In the U.S., the fuel efficiency of motorized vehicles (such as cars, [[truck]]s, or [[motorcycle]]s) is measured in mpg, as miles per [[gallon|U.S. gallon]] of [[gasoline]]. However, in the UK, the fuel efficiency is often measured in [[litre]]s of fuel used per 100 [[kilometre]]s, or in miles per [[gallon|imperial gallon]].
