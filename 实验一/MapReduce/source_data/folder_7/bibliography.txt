'''Bibliography''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βίβλος = book γραφή = write) is the arrangement of [[print]]ed [[book]]s and articles according to [[author]] or [[subject]], and the publication of lists of titles. Bibliographies are of many different kinds and may be annotated with information about their contents. Bibliographies may be organized in various ways, such as by authors, subjects or date of publication. Bibliographies without annotations are sometimes given the modest title of '''checklists'''. 
 
 Another meaning of '''Bibliography''' is the academic study of books as physical and cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as '''bibliology'''. This kind of bibliography is not concerned with the written content of books, but rather the  " bookness "  of books-–how they were designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted and collected.
