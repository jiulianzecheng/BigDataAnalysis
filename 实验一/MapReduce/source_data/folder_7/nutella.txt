 == History == 
 ''Pietro'' ''Ferrero,'' Nutella's creator, owned a bakery in Alba, an Italian town known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946, he sold the first 300-kilogram (660 lb) batch of ''Pasta Gianduja'', taken from Gianduja. Originally sold as a solid block, Ferrero started to sell a creamy version in 1951 as  " ''supercrema gianduja'' " . 
 
 ==Health concerns== 
 Even though Nutella is one of the best-selling spreads in the world, with a jar of Nutella being sold about every 2.5 seconds, it's been shown to be very bad for human health when eaten regularly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}} In just two tablespoons of Nutella, there are 21 grams of refined sugar, as well as 11 grams of fat (3.5 grams are saturated fat.) Nutella also has soy lecithin and vanillin, which are chemicals that are bad for human health. The only good thing about Nutella is that Nutella contains hazelnuts. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://isitbadforyou.com/questions/is-nutella-bad-for-you|title=Is It Bad For You? Get An Answer.
