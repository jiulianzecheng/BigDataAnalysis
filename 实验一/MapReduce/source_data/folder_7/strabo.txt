The father of [[Pompey]] was called  " [[Pompeius Strabo]]. "  A native of [[Sicily]] so clear-sighted that he could see things at great distance as if they were nearby was also called  " Strabo.

 Strabo was born in a rich family from [[Pontus]] < ref > ''Geography'' Book XII Chapter 3 Section 15,  " Amaseia, my fatherland. " < /ref >  which had become part of the [[Roman Empire]] a short time before. < ref > [[Pontus]] fell to the Roman general [[Pompey]] in 63 BC and after the murder or suicide of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] was broken up into smaller provinces in 64 BC. Strabo in Book 12 Chapter 3 Section 41 states that the Romans took possession of [[Bithynia]]  " a little before my time " , setting the date of his birth to after 63 BC. < /ref >  His mother was Georgian. He studied under several geographers and philosophers. Later he made long travels to [[Egypt]] and [[Kush]], among others. It is not known when his ''Geography'' was written, though comments within the work itself place the finished version within the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]]. 
 
 Strabo's ''History'' is nearly completely lost. Although Strabo quotes it himself, and other classical authors mention that it existed, the only surviving document is a fragment of papyrus now in possession of the University of [[Milan]] (renumbered  < nowiki > [ < /nowiki > Papyrus < nowiki > ] < /nowiki >  46). 
 
 Several different dates have been proposed for Strabo's death, but most of them place it shortly after 23.

 Strabo is mostly famous for his 17-volume work ''Geographica'', which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era. It is an important source of information on the ancient world.
