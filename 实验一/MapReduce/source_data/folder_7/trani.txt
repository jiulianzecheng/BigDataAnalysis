 ==History of Trani== 
 [[File:Trani by Louis-Jean Desprez.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Trani in the [[18th century]]]] 
 The old name of Trani was '''{{lang|la|Turenum}}''' or '''Tirenum'''. An old [[myth]] says that Tirenus built the city. Tirenus was the son of [[Diomedes]], a [[hero]] in [[ancient Greece]] who fought in the [[Trojan War]]. The city was on an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[map]] called the ''{{lang|la|Tabula Peutingeriana}}''. It was the first map to show this city. The map was made in the [[3rd century]]. At first, Trani was a very small city and not very important. It started to grow and be more important in the [[9th century]]. At that time, the [[Lombards]] (a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]]) ruled Trani. Later, the [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled the city. < ref name =  " Kleinhenz "  / > 
 
 The [[Normans]] took over Trani from the Byzantine Empire in the [[11th century]]. From the 11th century until the [[13th century]], Trani was a rich and very important city. This was especially true when the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] ruled Trani. Trani was an important [[port]] for the [[Knights Templar]] during the [[Crusades]]. People came from all over Italy to do business there. Many [[church]]es, [[palace]]s, and [[castle]]s were built in Trani during this time. < ref name =  " Kleinhenz "  / >  Many [[Jews]] lived in Trani at this time. There were 200 Jewish families and four big [[synagogue]]s in the city. Isaiah di Trani,  one of the most famous [[rabbi]]s of the [[Middle Ages]], lived there. < ref > ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1906). [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1672-apulia  " Apulia " ]. Funk and Wagnalls < /ref > 
 
 After Frederick II died in 1250, there was trouble in Trani. In the next 300 years, there were wars between the [[Angevin]]s, [[Aragon]] and [[Venice]] over who should rule Trani. The city became poorer and less important.  Trani was almost destroyed during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] at the end of the [[18th century]]. Many people in the town were against the [[French Revolution]]. In March 1799, they [[riot]]ed and killed many members of the city's most important families. When the French army saw this, they attacked the city on April 1, 1799. The army killed many people and burned Trani's buildings. Over 1000 people died in the riots and the French attack. < ref > Schiralli, Mario (April 20, 2011).
