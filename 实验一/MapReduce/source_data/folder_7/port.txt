 A '''port''' is a place at the edge of an ocean, river, or lake for ships to load and unload their cargo. Persons on ships can get on or off ships at a port. It is also called a [[harbour]] or harbor. This kind of port is the same as '''sea port'''. 
 
 A good port is easy to get to over water or land. It is also in a place that is not easily hurt by bad weather, like strong [[wind]] or big [[Ocean surface wave|waves]].
