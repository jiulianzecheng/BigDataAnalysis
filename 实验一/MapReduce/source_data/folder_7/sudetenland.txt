The '''Sudetenland''' was a [[mountain]]ous area of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The name comes from the [[Sudetes]], a mountain range, but it was also used for other places in [[Bohemia]] in which mostly-[[German people]] lived. They wanted their homes to be part of [[Germany]], not Czechoslovakia. [[Nazi Germany]] took small parts of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in September [[1938]].  After the [[Munich Agreement]], they took the rest of Sudetenland, which contributed to the start of [[World War II]].
