 The words '''nature''' and '''natural''' are used for all the things that are normally not made by [[human]]s. The word comes from the Latin ''natura'' meaning  " [[birth]] " . Nature includes many things like [[weather]], [[organisms]], [[landform]]s, [[celestial bodies]]. [[Scientist]]s study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be [[man-made]] or called [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. 
 
 There are [[natural sciences]] that study different parts of nature, for example the science of [[ecology]] is about plants and animals as a whole, while [[biology]] studies every type of living thing. 
 
 From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature {{ndash}} everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground {{ndash}} is interdependent. [[Medicine]] studies humans in health and sickness.  
 
 From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in [[conflict]]. People always use [[natural resource]]s. They cut down [[tree]]s, [[Mining|mine ores]], grow [[crop]]s and manufacture things from natural material. [[Fire]]s, [[car]]s, and [[factories]] make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious. 
 
 Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that [[physics]], the study of nature (etymologically), takes. 
 
 A useful definition of ''natural'' is  
 : " Happening or operating in accordance with the ordinary course of nature " . ''Oxford Shorter English Dictionary'' says the word in this sense is first found in 1477.
