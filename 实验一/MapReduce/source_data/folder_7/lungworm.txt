 The '''lungworm''' is a type of [[parasite]]. It lives inside other animals' bodies.  Lungworms are [[nematode|roundworm]]s in the order [[Strongylida]].  They have round bodies.  When people say the word  " lungworm, "  they may mean any of a few worms: ''[[Eucoleus aerophilus]]'', ''[[Oslerus osleri]]'', ''[[Crenostoma vulpis]]'', ''[[Eucoleus boehmi]]'', or ''[[Filaroides hirthi]]''. Some people also use it for ''[[Angiostrongylus vasorum]]'', but that worm is really a [[heartworm]]. < ref name=VCA > {{cite web|url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/lungworm-infections-in-dogs|accessdate=July 13, 2022|publisher=VCA Animal Hospitals|title= Lungworm Infections in Dogs|author1=Krista Williams|author2= Cheryl Yuill}} < /ref > 
 
 Lungworms can live in foxes, dogs, cats, sheep, < ref name=Sheep > {{cite web|url=https://www.nadis.org.uk/disease-a-z/sheep/lungworm-and-other-respiratory-disease-in-adult-and-yearling-sheep/|accessdate=July 15, 2022|publisher=NADIS|title=Lungworm and other Respiratory Disease in Adult and Yearling Sheep}} < /ref >  and other animals.  Some lungworms live in the animal's nose.  Some live in its [[trachea|throat]].  Some live in its [[lung]]s. < ref name=VCA / > 
 
 In sheep, lungworm is not as dangerous as other worms. < ref name=Sheep / > 
 
 ==Life cycle== 
 Some lungworms can send their eggs from one host to another.  Other lungworms need another [[intermediate host|host in between]] to grow. < ref name=VCA / > 
 
 Snails and slugs eat lungworm eggs.  The eggs grow into larvae inside the snail or slug.  When a fox or dog eats the snail or slug (or another animal that just ate the snail or slug), it catches lungworms.  The lungworms lay eggs in the host's lungs, then it coughs them up to its throat and swallows them.  The eggs leave the host in its [[feces]].  Then the snails or slugs come to eat the feces and take in the eggs too.  In some lungworms, the eggs go to new hosts when an old host coughs on them. < ref name=VCA / > 
 
 ==In popular culture== 
 
 Lungworms in sheep are part of the story of the 20th century [[novel|book]] ''[[Independent People]]'' (''Sjálfstætt fólk'') by [[Iceland|Icelandic]] author [[Halldór Laxness]].
