A '''hellabyte''' is a [[unit of measurement]] for [[computer]]s of the future. One hellabyte holds 1000 [[yottabyte]]s ('''YB''') or an octillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) [[byte]]s. 
 
 A hellabyte is so large that it would take about a trillion [[Supercomputer]]s to store this amount of data.
