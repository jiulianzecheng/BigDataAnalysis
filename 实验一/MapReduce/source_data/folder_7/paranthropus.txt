 '''''Paranthropus''''' is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of [https://wiktionary.org/wiki/robust robust] [[australopithecine]]s. They probably descended from the genus ''[[Australopithecus]]''. 
 
 == Description == 
 All species of ''Paranthropus'' were [[bipedal]], and many lived during a time when species of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', such as ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' and ''[[Homo erectus]]'', were living. 
 
 ''Paranthropus'' first appeared roughly 2.7 million years ago. Most species of ''Paranthropus'' had a [[brain]] about 40 percent of the size of modern [[human|man]]. There was some size variation between the different species of ''Paranthropus'', but most stood roughly 1.3-1.4 m (4.26 to 4.59 feet) tall and were quite well muscled. ''Paranthropus'' is thought to have lived in wooded areas rather than the grasslands of the ''Australopithecus''. 
 
 ''Australopithecus'' and ''Paranthropus'' also looked very different from each other. These differences were only found in remains of the [[skull]]. The other parts of the [[skeleton]] were still very similar, so it is reasonable to think the difference was an [[adaptation]] to different food. ''Paranthropus'' was more massively built as to skull and [[tooth|teeth]]. It often had [[gorilla]]-like [[sagittal crest]]s on the [[skull|cranium]] which anchored massive temporalis muscles for chewing. < ref name=Wood > {{cite journal | author = Wood B.  &  Strait D. | year = 2004 | title = Patterns of resource use in early ''Homo'' and ''Paranthropus'' | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–162 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2003.11.004 | pmid = 14871560 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Behaviour === 
 ''Paranthropus'' did not behave in the same way as ''Homo''. They lived on a diet of heavy-duty plant material: leaves, slim branches, grass, roots. The [[diet]] might be supplemented with insect grubs. Lacking our flexible behaviour, ''Paranthropus'' relied on the steady [[environment]]al conditions of the [[tropical]] [[forest]]. Members of the genus ''Homo'', such as ''[[Homo habilis]]'', had proportionately larger brains and more flexible behaviour. They were able to eat a much wider variety of foods. 
 
 == Disputed taxonomy == 
 Opinions differ whether the species ''P. aethiopicus, P. boisei'' and ''P. robustus'' should be included within the genus ''[[Australopithecus]]''. On Wikipedia, the genus ''Paranthropus'' is used for all articles which mention the species ''P. aethiopicus, P. boisei'' and ''P. robustus''. 
 
 == Occurrence == 
 For the most part the ''Australopithecus'' species ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|A. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus africanus|A. africanus]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus anamensis|A. anamensis]]'' either disappeared from the fossil record before the appearance of early humans or seem to have been the ancestors of ''Homo habilis''. ''P. boisei'' and ''P. aethiopicus'', on the other hand, continued to evolve along a separate path distinct and unrelated to early humans. ''Paranthropus'' shared the earth with some early examples of the ''Homo'' genus, such as ''H. habilis'', ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]'', and possibly even ''[[Homo erectus|H. erectus]]''. 
 
 == Intelligence == 
 Species of ''Paranthropus'' had smaller braincases than ''Homo'', yet they had significantly larger braincases than ''Australopithecus''. Paranthropus is associated with stone tools both in southern and eastern Africa, although there is considerable debate whether they were made and utilized by these robust australopithecines. Most believe that early ''Homo'' was the tool maker. < ref name=Klein > {{cite book | author = Klein, R. | year = 1999 | title = The human career | url = https://archive.org/details/humancareerhuman00klei_0 | publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 9780226439631 }} < /ref >  Most ''Paranthropus'' species almost certainly did not have [[language]] or to have controlled [[fire]], although they are directly associated with the latter at Swartkrans, South Africa. < ref name=Klein/ > 
 
 == Discovery == 
 [[File:Paranthropus_boisei_skull.jpg|thumb|Replica of the skull found by Mary Leakey. Notice the sagittal crest on top of the skull, the robust [[dentary]] (lower jaw) with its heavy-duty [[molar]] teeth. Like the [[gorilla]], this animal was a [[herbivore]]. The shape of the [[jaw]] is like a [[parabola]]; in gorillas it is more flat at the front. The shape of the jaw and the [[canine]]s (which do not protrude) are human-like characters.]] 
 
 A partial cranium and mandible of ''Paranthropus robustus'' was discovered in 1938 by a schoolboy, 70 & nbsp;km south west of [[Pretoria]] in [[South Africa]]. It was described as a new genus and species by [[Robert Broom]] of the [[Transvaal]] Museum. A date of at least 1.95 million years has been obtained for the site. 
 
 ''Paranthropus boisei'' was discovered by [[Mary Leakey]] in July 1959 at the site of [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]]. Mary was working alone, as [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] was ill in camp. She rushed back to camp and at the news Louis made a remarkable recovery. 
 
 In his notes Louis recorded a first name, ''Titanohomo mirabilis'', reflecting an initial impression of close human affinity. Louis and Mary began to call it  " Dear Boy " . Recovery was halted on August 7. Dear Boy was in context with [[Oldowan]] tools and animal bones. 
 
 The fossil was published in ''Nature'' on 15 August 1959, but due to a strike of the printers the issue was not released until September. In it Louis placed the fossil in [[Robert Broom|Broom]]'s Australopithecinae family, creating a new genus for it, ''Zinjanthropus'', species ''boisei''.  " Zinj "  is an ancient Arabic word for the coast of East Africa and  " boisei "  referred to Charles Boise, an anthropological benefactor of the Leakeys. Louis based his classification on twenty differences from [[Australopithecus]]. 
 
 Broom had died in 1951 but [[Raymond Dart|Dart]] was still living. He is said to have wept for joy on Louis' behalf on being personally shown Zinj, which Louis and Mary carried around in a tin (later a box). Louis had considered Broom's ''Paranthropus'' genus, but rejected it because he believed Zinj was in the ''Homo'' ancestral stock but Paranthropus was not. He relied heavily on the larger size of Zinj's canines. 
 
 The battle of the name raged on for many years and drove a wedge between Louis and [[Wilfrid Le Gros Clark|LeGros Clark]], who took the ''Paranthropus'' view. On the other hand it brought the Leakeys and Dr. [[Melville Bell Grosvenor]] of the [[National Geographic Society]] together. The Leakeys became international figures and had no trouble finding funds from then on. The Zinj question ultimately became part of the ''Australopithecus''/''Paranthropus'' question (which only applied to the robust Australopithecines).
