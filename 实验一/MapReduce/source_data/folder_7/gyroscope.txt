 A '''gyroscope''' is a [[Machine|device]] used to measure or maintain an [[angle|angular]] [[position]]. It works using the principles of [[angular momentum]]. The gyroscope is made up of a [[Rotation|spinning]] [[wheel]] or [[disc]], as well as (in some cases) many other moving parts. It helps with [[navigation]], and plays a part in such things as a [[gyrocompass]] and [[artificial horizon]].
