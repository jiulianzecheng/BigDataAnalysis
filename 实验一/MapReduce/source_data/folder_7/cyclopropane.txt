 '''Cyclopropane''' is the [[cycloalkane]] [[molecule]] with the [[molecular formula|formula]] {{chem|[[Carbon|C]]|3|[[Hydrogen|H]]|6}}, with three carbon [[atom]]s connected to each other in a ring structure, and each carbon atom being connected to two hydrogen atoms. The ring is very small, and [[ring strain]] can take place because of this. 
 
 Cyclopropane is an [[anesthetic]], meaning inhaling large quantities of the [[gas]] form that [[evaporation|evaporates]] can send somebody to [[sleep]], however today, other chemicals are used by medical professionals. It is also very [[reactivity|reactive]], and can [[explosion|explode]] when mixed with [[oxygen]].
