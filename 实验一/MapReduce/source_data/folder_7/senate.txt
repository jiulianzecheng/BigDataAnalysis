In a modern [[democracy]], a '''senate''' is a group of [[wikt:people|people]] who are part of a [[legislature]]. A legislature passes or changes [[law]]s for their [[country]], [[state]], or other area. Members of a senate are called senators. Some legislatures are [[bicameral]], meaning they have two groups of people (working in separate places) called ''houses''. A senate can be called a ''House of Senators''.  
 
 The senate of some such legislatures is weaker than the other house. The other house is called a ''[[House of Representatives]]'', [[House of Commons]], or Assembly. In bicameral legislatures, both houses must pass the same [[bill]] to make it a law. Modern democratic systems having legislatures with senates include the [[United States of America]] (U. S.), [[Senate of Canada|Canada]], [[Australia]] and many states in the United States. 
 
 The first ever senate was the [[Roman Senate]]. The name comes from their word for  " elder " . 
 
 Senate is also the name of the ruling body of some [[university|universities]].

 Sometimes, the senators are split into different groups, who then have different responsibilities. These groups  meet in different rooms; each group is called a ''chamber''.
