 '''Nerva''' (Marcus Cocceius Nerva, 8 November 30 – 25 January 98) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 96 to 98. 
 
 Nerva became emperor at the age of sixty-five, after a lifetime of imperial service under [[Nero]] and the rulers of the [[Flavian dynasty]]. Under Nero, he was a member of the imperial team, and played a vital part in exposing the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] of 65. 
 
 Later, as a loyalist to the Flavians, he attained [[Roman consul|consulships]] in 71 and 90 during the reigns of [[Vespasian]] and [[Domitian]] respectively. 
 
 On 18 September 96, Domitian was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in a palace conspiracy. On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the [[Roman Senate]]. As the new ruler of the [[Roman Empire]], he vowed to restore [[Liberty|liberties]] which had been cut during the [[autocratic]] government of Domitian. 
 
 Nerva's brief reign was marred by [[financial]] difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the [[Roman army]]. 
 
 A revolt by the [[Praetorian Guard]] in October 97 caused him to [[Adoption|adopt]] an [[heir]]. After some deliberation Nerva adopted [[Trajan]], a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva died of natural causes. 
 
 Although much of his life remains obscure, Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient [[historian]]s. Recent historians have revised this assessment, characterizing Nerva as a well-intentioned but ultimately weak ruler, whose reign brought the Roman Empire to the brink of [[civil war]]. < ref > Grainger, John D. 2003. ''Nerva and the Roman succession crisis of AD 96–99''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-28917-3}}. < /ref > 
 
 Nerva's greatest success was his choice of Trajan. This led to a peaceful transition after his death, thus founding the [[Nerva-Antonine dynasty]].
