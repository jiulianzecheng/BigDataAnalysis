 The '''spine''' is a [[column]] of [[vertebra]]e in the back part of the [[torso]] (upper body). It is also called the '''backbone''' or '''vertebral column'''. There is a spinal canal that runs through the length of the spine. Inside this canal is the [[spinal cord]]. Animals that have a spine are called [[vertebrate]]s, and animals that do not have one are called [[invertebrate]]s. Humans have a spine, so we are vertebrates. Many vertebrates, including [[mammal]]s, have [[intervertebral disc]]s separating the vertebrae. 
 
 == Regions == 
 The vertebral column has five ''regions''. These regions from top to bottom are: 
 * Cervical - Shown in red, this region supports the [[head]]. It is made up of 7 vertebrae. The first two, called the atlas and axis, connect the spine to the skull. 
 * Thoracic - Shown in blue, this region supports the [[rib cage|ribs]]. It is made up of 12 vertebrae. 
 * Lumbar - Shown in yellow, this region is located in the lower back. It is made up of 5 vertebrae. 
 *[[Sacrum|Sacral]] - Shown in green. It is made up of 5 vertebrae that are [[fusion|fused]] together. 
 *[[Coccyx|Coccygeal]] - Shown in purple. It is made up of 3 to 5 vertebrae. 
 
 == Spinal canal == 
 The spinal column has an opening called spinal canal and this opening is used for [[Nerve|nerves]]. The part of the [[central nervous system]] in the spinal column is called [[spinal cord]].
