 Annelids are a [[phylum]] of [[invertebrate]] worms. They are the [[segment]]ed [[worm]]s, with over 17,000 known [[species]]. 
 
 Well known species are [[earthworm]]s and [[leech]]es. Annelids can be found in most wet environments. Some of these species are [[parasitic]] or [[Mutualism|mutualistic]]. This means they live together with (or inside) another organism. A mutualistic relationship is beneficial to both organisms. Their size varies from under a millimetre to about 3 metres. The largest known species is the [[seep tube worm]] (''Lamellibrachia lymnesi''), which is related to the [[giant tube worm]]. 
 
 Annelids are made of one or more body segments. Each segment has one or more rings. These rings are called ''annuli'' (singular: 'annulus' = 'little ring'). Annelids reproduce sexually by [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] cross-fertilization. They can regenerate cut off pieces of their body, unlike sponges, which can come back together if ripped apart. They have a hydrostatic [[skeleton]], a one-way digestion system, and [[bilateral symmetry]]. 
 
 == Nervous system == 
 Annelid worms have a nervous system. The [[brain]] forms a ring round the [[pharynx]] (throat), consisting of a pair of [[ganglia]] (local control centers) above and in front of the pharynx, linked by nerve cords either side of the pharynx to another pair of ganglia just below and behind it. < ref name=Barnes > Ruppert E.E; Fox R.S. and Barnes R.D. 2004. Annelida, in ''Invertebrate Zoology'' 7th ed, Brooks/Cole. pp. 414–420. {{ISBN|0-03-025982-7}} < /ref >  In some very mobile and active [[polychaete]]s the brain is enlarged and more complex, with visible hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain sections. < ref > Rouse G. 1998.

 The rest of the central nervous system is usually 'ladder-like', with a pair of nerve cords that run along the bottom part of the body cavity. In each segment there are paired ganglia linked by a cross-connection. From each segmental ganglion a branching system of local nerves runs into the body wall and then encircles the body. < ref name=Barnes/ >
