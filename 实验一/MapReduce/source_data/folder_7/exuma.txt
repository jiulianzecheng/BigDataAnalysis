 '''Exuma''' is a district of the [[Bahamas]].  It has over 360 islands. The largest of the [[cay]]s is '''Great Exuma'''. It is joined to another island, Little Exuma by a small bridge. The capital and largest city in the district is George Town. The entire island chain is 130 & nbsp;mi (209 & nbsp;km) long and 27 sq. mi (72 & nbsp;km²) in area. 
 
 In 1783, [[United States|American]] [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]]s running from the [[Revolutionary War]] came to the island. 
 
 The islands are a popular spot for [[yachting]], [[sailing]], [[diving]], and [[coral reef]] and [[cave]] exploring.  Many of the unnamed beaches and coves of the islands are in the [[Exuma National Land and Sea Park]].
