'''Purchasing''' is the [[wikt:buy|buying]] of [[goods]] or [[Service (economics)|service]]s. An item that has been bought is called a '''purchase'''. The opposite of a purchase is a [[wikt:sale|sale]]. In common usage, the shorter word  " buy "  is typically used when shopping, rather than the word  " purchase " . 
 
 However, the word has been used in many major historical terms, including: 
 
 :* the [[Louisiana Purchase]] (of 1803), which greatly increased the size of the U.S.; 
 :* the [[Purchase System]] in the [[British Army]]; 
 :* the [[Ashbourne Irish Land Purchase Act]], or similar laws; 
 :* a [[Purchase and Sale Agreement]], as a contract between a buyer and seller of land ([[real estate]]). 
 
 The word ''purchase'' is often used in contracts with  " [[Procurement|acquisition]] " , as in the term  " [[Acquisitions and Mergers]] "  (A & M) in legal agreements made between large companies. Those [[contract]]s typically state than a [[company]] was ''purchased'' by another company.
