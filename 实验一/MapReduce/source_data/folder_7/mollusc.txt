 '''Mollusks''' are an important [[phylum]] of [[invertebrate]] animals. Most of them are marine animals, which means they live in the [[ocean]]. They have huge numbers in-shore, that is, in shallow water. They are the largest marine phylum, with about 85,000 living species, 23% of all named marine organisms. They also occur in freshwater and on land. 
 
 Mollusks are extremely varied: they have great diversity. That may be why there is no word in English for the phylum as a whole.  " In an [[evolutionary]] sense, mollusks are plastic material " . < ref > Morton J.E. 1958. ''Molluscs''. London: Hutchinson University Library, p11. < /ref >  They have much more variety than their ancient rivals, the [[brachiopod]]s. < ref name=Barnes04/ > 
 
 Most molluscs have [[Shell (zoology)|shells]], but some groups do not: [[octopod]]s, [[slug]]s, and the [[gastropod]]s known as [[sea slug]]s. 
 
 == Diversity == 
 Many mollusks also live in [[freshwater]] and [[terrestrial]] [[habitat]]s. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in [[anatomy|anatomical]] structure, but also in [[behaviour]] and in habitat. 
 
 The phylum is usually divided into 9 or 10 [[taxonomic]] [[class (biology)|classes]], of which two are entirely [[extinct]]. [[Cephalopod]] molluscs, such as [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]] and [[octopus]], are among the most [[neurobiology|neurologically advanced]] of all [[invertebrate]]s: they have good brains and complex behaviours. Either the [[giant squid]] or the [[colossal squid]] is the largest known invertebrate species. The [[gastropod]]s ([[snail]]s and [[slug]]s) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. The scientific study of mollusks is called [[malacology]]. < ref > {{cite book

 == Main features == 
 The three most universal features defining modern mollusks are: 
 # a [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] with a cavity used for breathing and [[excretion]], 
 # the presence of a [[radula]], and 
 # the structure of the [[nervous system]]. 
 
 Other than these things, mollusks have so much variety that many textbooks use a  " hypothetical ancestral mollusk "  to summarize them (see below). This has a single,  " [[limpet]]-like "  shell on top, which is made of [[protein]]s and [[chitin]] reinforced with [[calcium carbonate]]. It is secreted by a mantle covering the whole upper surface. The underside of the animal consists of a single muscular  " foot " . 
 
 The mollusk's feeding system starts with a rasping  " tongue " , the [[radula]]. The complex digestive system uses [[mucus]] and microscopic, muscle-powered  " hairs "  called [[cilia]]. The generalized mollusk has two paired [[nerve cord]]s, or three in [[bivalve]]s. The [[brain]], in species that have one, circles the [[oesophagus]]. Most mollusks have [[eyes]], and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan [[reproductive system]] relies on external [[fertilization]], but more complex variations occur. All produce [[egg (biology)|eggs]], from which may emerge [[trochophore]] [[larvae]], more complex [[veliger]] larvae, or miniature adults. 
 
 A striking feature of molluscs is the use of the same organ for multiple functions. For example, the heart and [[nephridia]] ( " kidneys " ) are important parts of the reproductive system, as well as the circulatory and excretory systems. In bivalves, the [[gill]]s both  " breathe "  and produce a water current in the mantle cavity: this is important for excretion and reproduction. In reproduction, molluscs may change [[gender]] to accommodate the other breeding partner. 
 
 Good evidence exists for the appearance of gastropods, [[cephalopods]] and bivalves in the [[Cambrian]] period, 541 to 485.4 million years ago (mya). Before that, the evolutionary history of molluscs' emergence from the ancestral [[Lophotrochozoa]] is still unclear. 
 
 Mollusk species can also represent hazards or pests for human activities. The bite of the [[blue-ringed octopus]] is often fatal, and that of ''Octopus apollyon'' causes [[inflammation]] that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical [[cone shell]]s can also kill: their venom have become important tools in [[neurology|neurological]] research. [[Schistosomiasis]] (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200 & nbsp;million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some [[ecosystem]]s. 
 
 == A  " generalized mollusk "  == 
 [[File:Archimollusc-en.svg|550px|thumb|center|Anatomical diagram of a hypothetical ancestral mollusc]] 
 
 Because mollusks have so many different shapes, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an ''archi-mollusc'', ''hypothetical generalized mollusc'', or ''hypothetical ancestral mollusc'' (''HAM'') to illustrate the most common features in the phylum. The picture is rather similar to modern [[monoplacophora]]ns: some think it may resemble very early mollusks. < ref name= " Barnes04 " > {{cite book| last = Ruppert| first = Edward E.| title = Invertebrate Zoology: A Functional Evolutionary Approach| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780030259821| year = 2004| publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company| isbn = 978-0-03-025982-1 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Healy2001MolluscaInvertebrateZoology " > {{cite book

 The generalized mollusk is bilaterally symmetrical and has a single,  " [[limpet]]-like "  shell on top. The shell is secreted by a mantle covering the upper surface. The underside consists of a single muscular  " foot " . < ref name=Barnes04/ >  The visceral mass, or visceropallium, is the soft, nonmuscular metabolic region of the mollusc. It contains the body organs. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 Classes of molluscs: 
 * [[Aplacophora]]: molluscs: the living ones are shell-less 
 * [[Bivalvia]]: Most [[shellfish]]; [[clam]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[scallop]]s, [[mussel]]s 
 * [[Cephalopoda]]: [[Squid]], ''[[Octopus]]'' 
 * [[Gastropoda]]: [[whelk]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s, [[Nudibranch]]s 
 * [[Helcionelloida]]: (see below) 
 * [[Monoplacophora]]: molluscs with a cap-like shell 
 * [[Polyplacophora]]: [[Chiton]]s 
 * †[[Rostroconchia]]: an extinct group 
 * [[Scaphopoda]]: the tusk shells 
 
 === Helcionelloida === 
 It has become clear that the [[fossil]] taxon [[Helcionelloida]] does ''not'' belong to the class Gastropoda. It is now a separate class in the Mollusca. Parkhaev (2006, 2007) created the class Helcionelloida, whose members were previously treated as  " Paleozoic mollusks of uncertain systematic position "  by Bouchet  &  Rocroi. < ref > P. Yu. Parkhaev (2006)  " ''[http://macroevolution.narod.ru/22parkhaev.pdf Adaptive radiation of the Cambrian helcionelloid mollusks (Gastropoda, Archaeobranchia).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205708/http://macroevolution.narod.ru/22parkhaev.pdf |date=2015-06-10 }}'' "  In: S.V.

 == Uses == 
 * Many mollusks are eaten as food: [[clams]], [[oyster]]s, [[scallop]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[squid]] (calamari) and land [[snail]]s (escargot) 
 * Oysters sometimes make [[pearl]]s, which are valuable and used to make [[necklace]]s. Other shells are collected for their beauty and sometimes used to make [[jewellery|jewelry]].
