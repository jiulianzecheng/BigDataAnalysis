 The '''Chondrostei''' < ref > The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chondros'' meaning cartilage and ''osteo'' meaning bone. < /ref >  are a sub-class of ray-finned fish, the [[Actinopterygii]]. They include the [[sturgeon]]s, huge fish which provide [[caviar]]. 
 
 The Chondrostei are mainly [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] fish with some [[bone|ossification]]. There are 52 species divided among two orders. The orders are the [[Acipenseriformes]] ([[sturgeon]]s and [[paddlefish]]es), and the [[Polypteriformes]] ([[reedfish]]es and [[bichir]]s).  
 
 This group has at times been classified with the [[shark]]s: the similarities are obvious, not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish. Both lack [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] (except the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include [[spiracle]]s and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the [[vertebra]]e extend into the larger lobe of the [[caudal fin]]). However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the [[Teleostei]] than their external appearance might suggest. < ref name= " chondro " / > 
 
 == Evolution == 
 It is thought that the ancestors of the chondrosteans were [[bony fish]] but that this characteristic was lost in later [[evolution]]ary development, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton which suggests that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish. < ref name=chondro > {{cite web | url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/090Teleostomi/090.300.html | title=Chondrosteans: Sturgeon Relatives | publisher=paleos.com | access-date=2010-12-06 | archive-date=2010-12-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225152809/http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/090Teleostomi/090.300.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 In the early [[Mesozoic]], a number of fish families were beginning to develop [[adaptation]]s which would make them lighter, faster and more efficient [[predator]]s. Chondrosteans took a radical approach. Cartilage is lighter than bone, and they delayed the development of bone, so that it only developed in elderly fish. They lost the upper jaw bones completely. Other changes allowed them to shoot the jaw forwards to grab [[prey]]. 
 
 Why did Chondrosteans react with such total reorganization? Obviously [[Natural selection|selection pressure]] must have been very strong. However, in one way they were almost unique. Rarely amongst animals, they underwent [[polyploidy]], several times. Instead of two sets of chromosomes ([[diploid]]), the Chondrosteans have 8 or 16 sets of chromosomes. Such a dramatic genetic change may have given the potential for a rapid, drastic reorganization of the body plan. < ref name=chondro/ > 
 
 === Paraphyly === 
 The Chondrostei are [[paraphyletic]]. The group does not contain all of its descendants. Therefore, it is going to be reorganized.
