 '''Gnathostomata''' is the group of [[vertebrate]]s with [[jaw]]s. 
 
 The group was meant to include all jawed [[fish]], but in modern fashion it also includes all the [[Tetrapod|tetrapods]] as well, since they evolved from jawed fish. It is the sister group of the [[Agnatha]], the jawless vertebrates. 
 
 The Gnathostomata first appeared in the [[Ordovician]] period and became diverse in the [[Devonian]] period, the 'Age of Fishes'. Land vertebrates appeared in the [[Carboniferous]] period.
