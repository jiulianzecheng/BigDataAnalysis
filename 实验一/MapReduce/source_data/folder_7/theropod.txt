 '''Theropods''' ('beast foot') are a group of [[bipedal]] [[saurischia]]n [[dinosaur]]s. 
 
 Although they were primarily [[carnivore|carnivorous]], a number of theropod groups evolved [[herbivore|herbivory]], [[omnivore|omnivory]] and [[insectivore|insectivory]]. < ref name= " zannoetal2009 " > Zanno L.E; Gillette D.D; Albright L.B. and Titus A.L. 2009.

 Today, they are represented by 10,000 living species of [[bird]]s, which evolved in the [[Upper Jurassic]] from small [[feather]]ed [[coelurosaur]]ian theropods. 
 
 Among the features linking theropods to birds are [[bipedalism]], the three-toed foot, a [[furcula]] (wishbone), air-filled bones, feathers and brooding of the eggs. 
 
 ==Early theropods== 
 Theropods first appear in the earliest part of the [[Upper Triassic]] about 230 million years ago. They were the sole large terrestrial carnivores from the [[Lower Jurassic]] until the close of the [[Cretaceous]], about 66 million years ago. 
 
 Some of the earliest and most primitive of the theropod dinosaurs were: 
 *''[[Eodromaeus]]'' 
 *coelophysids, a family including ''[[Coelophysis]]''
