 '''''Irezumi''''' is the Japanese word for [[tattoo]]. In English, it is used to talk about many types of [[Japan|Japanese]] tattoos. It is also used to talk about ways of tattooing people that came from Japanese people, such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuan]] people. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Lewallen|first=Ann-Elise|date=2016-01-02|title= " Clamoring Blood " : The Materiality of Belonging in Modern Ainu Identity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14672715.2015.1131400|journal=Critical Asian Studies|volume=48|issue=1|pages=50â€“76|doi=10.1080/14672715.2015.1131400|issn=1467-2715|s2cid=146832984}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Irezumi'' is not done with any [[Tattoo machine|tattoo machines]]. It is done with metal needles that are put on wooden sticks with [[silk]]. It uses a special type of [[ink]] called ''Nara'' ink. Ainu and Ryukyuan tattoos use ink from [[Indigofera|indigo plants]]. Making ''irezumi'' in this way takes a long time. It is also painful to get ''irezumi''. Tattoos are made by a small number of people named ''horishi''. ''Horishi'' usually have [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]] that work with them. < ref > Bagot, Pascal.

 During the [[Edo period]], criminals were given tattoos. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-09-10|title=The Tattoos that Marked the Criminals of the Edo Period|url=https://pen-online.com/culture/the-tattoos-that-marked-the-criminals-of-the-edo-period/|access-date=2023-02-14|website=Pen Magazine International|language=en}} < /ref >  Where these tattoos were put was based on what crime someone did. For example, murderers were tattooed on the head. This made tattoos connected to crime in Japan. In the 19th century, the Japanese government made tattoos illegal.
