'''Macroeconomics''' studies large-scale [[economic]] [[decision]]s. For example, a whole country's [[economy]] (or, its economic output) is summarised by the [[GDP]] (gross domestic product). Many governments use macroeconomic ideas to decide how much [[tax]] to collect and what [[interest]] rates should be. 
 
 It also considers the amount of [[unemployment]], the rate that prices go up ([[inflation]]), and the [[exchange rate]]s of its [[currency]]. The exchange rate affects the amount of [[import]]s and [[export]]s. Exchange rates and taxation are  " [[lever]]s of the economy " . 
 
 Less dramatic, but also very important, are decisions about government spending inside the country. Such policy decisions are politically [[controversy|controversial]] due to differing political ideas on government spending. Another factor in macroeconomics is the make-up of the population. A growing population is economically different from a stable population (one which is not growing).
