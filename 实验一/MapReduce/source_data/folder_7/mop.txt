 A '''mop''' is a tool used for cleaning. It is usually pieces of cloth or a sponge attached to the end of a long stick. 
 
 A dry mop'' is typically used to clean the floor, while a ''wet mop'' is used to remove dust.'' 
 
 The word (then spelled ''mappe'') was first used in English as early as 1496, but new designs and variations of the original mop designs have been introduced, from time to time. For example, American inventor Jacob Howe received U.S. patent #241 for a mop holder in 1837, < ref > {{US patent|241}} < /ref >  and Thomas W. Stewart (U.S. patent #499,402) received a patent for a mop holder in 1893. < ref > {{US patent|499,402}} < /ref >
