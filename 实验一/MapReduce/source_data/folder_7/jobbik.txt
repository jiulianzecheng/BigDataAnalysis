 The Movement for a Better [[Hungary]] (Hungarian: Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom), commonly known as Jobbik, is a conservative political party in Hungary. 
 
 Originating with radical and nationalist roots,at its beginnings, the party described itself as  " a principled, conservative and radically patriotic Christian party " , whose  " fundamental purpose "  is the protection of  " Hungarian values and interests. "  In 2014, the party was described as an  " anti-Semitic organization "  by [[The Independent]] and a  " neo-Nazi party "  by the president of the European Jewish Congress. From 2015 to 2020, the party started to re-define itself as a more moderate conservative people's party and changed the controversial elements of its communication, culminating with its new declaration of principles now defining itself as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], pro-European party with some residual moderated nationalist tendencies (the position [[Fidesz]] originally occupied). According to the party's  " Declaration of Principles " , Jobbik will  " always focus on the interests of Hungary and the Hungarian people instead of a political group or an ideology. On the other hand, Jobbik reject[s] hatemongering and extreme political views that are contrary to Christian values and ethics 
 
 After the Hungarian parliamentary elections on 8 April 2018, the party polled 1,092,806 votes, securing 19.06% of the total, making it Hungary's second-largest party in the National Assembly.
