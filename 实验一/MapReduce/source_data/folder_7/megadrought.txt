A '''megadrought''' is an extended [[drought]]. It lasts two decades or more. Megadroughts in the past were linked with [[La Ni√±a]] conditions lasting for many years. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Characteristics and Likely Causes of the Medieval Megadroughts|publisher=The Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory|url=http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/drought/medieval.shtml|access-date=May 15, 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 The term ''megadrought'' generally refers to the length of a drought, not its intensity. Multiyear droughts lasting one decade or less, like the [[Dust Bowl]] drought of the 1930s, are not a megadrought though they lasted a long time. 
 
 Megadroughts have caused people to move away from the drought-affected areas. One example is [[Ancestral Puebloans]] in the [[Southwestern United States]].
