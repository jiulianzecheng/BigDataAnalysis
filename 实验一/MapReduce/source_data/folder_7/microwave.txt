 A '''microwave''' is a high-[[frequency]] [[radio wave]]. They are broadly defined as having a wavelength between 1 millimeter and 1 meter, or narrowly between 3 mm and 300 mm. Microwaves have many uses including [[radar]], [[radio astronomy]], and to heat [[food]] in a [[microwave oven]]. Unlike longer radio waves, they do not bend around land obstacles but go in line of sight. Still, they are much used for [[communication]] because they can have a high [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Almost all [[spacecraft]] communicate by microwave radio. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Microwave Technology|url=https://www.cablefree.net/wirelesstechnology/microwave/|access-date=2021-06-16|website=CableFree|language=en-GB}} < /ref > < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|title=Microwave radio {{!}} computer science|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/microwave-radio|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 When something moves, it almost always has a wave pattern to its movement - this can be seen in water most easily, in ripples and ocean waves. A very common type of wave in the universe is [[electromagnetic waves]]. Light is an example of an electromagnetic wave, and so is a microwave, for example the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. We can only see electromagnetic radiation in the visible light spectrum (which is why it's called the visible light spectrum), so microwaves are invisible. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Microwave Communication: Using a Microwave Link|url=https://www.dpstele.com/network-monitoring/microwave/transmission.php|access-date=2021-06-16|website=www.dpstele.com}} < /ref > 
 
 Microwaves were among the first radio waves discovered, in the late 19th century, by [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Microwave Ovens == 
 [[Microwave oven]]s work because microwaves make [[Polar bond|polar molecules]] (molecules that act like tiny [[magnet]]s) all face the same direction - to visualize it, imagine that the microwave oven is telling all of the molecules to face left, then right.  Heat is just the movement of molecules, so when the molecules do a great amount of moving, they are hot.   
 
 Like other heat sources, microwave [[radiation]] can cause [[burns]]. They can go through skin and muscles. If vital organs are burned, the burns can kill. This is why a microwave oven does not work with the door open.
