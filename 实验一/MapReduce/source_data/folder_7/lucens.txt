 == History == 
 Lucens was first mentioned in 964 as ''in villa Losingus''. It was formerly known by the [[German language|German]] name ''Losingen''. 
 
 In 1969, the [[Lucens reactor]], an underground [[nuclear reactor]] started operation in Lucens. It soon had a serious accident, resulting in massive [[radioactive contamination]] of the underground site, which was then sealed. 
 
 The nearby municipality [[Oulens-sur-Lucens]] became part of Lucens municipality on 1 July 2011. < ref name=Fusion > [http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/03.html Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office {{in lang|de}} accessed 17 February 2011 < /ref > 
 
 On 1 January 2017, the former municipalities of Brenles, [[Chesalles-sur-Moudon]], [[Cremin]], [[Forel-sur-Lucens]] and [[Sarzens]] joined together to become the municipality of Lucens. < ref > [https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/grundlagen/agvch.html Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{in lang|de}} accessed 10 January 2017 < /ref >
