[[File:Squarecubetesseract.png|right|thumb|385px|From left to right, the [[square (geometry)|square]], the [[cube]], and the [[tesseract]]. The square is a 2-dimensional object, the cube is a 3-dimensional object, and the tesseract is a 4-dimensional object.  A 1-dimensional object is just a line.  A [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two-dimensional screen. The same applies to the tesseract, which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in three-dimensional space.]]

 '''Dimensions''' are the way we see, [[measure]] and [[experience]] our world, by using up and down, right to left, back to front, [[hot]] and [[cold]], how heavy and how long, as well as more advanced concepts from [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. One way to define a dimension is to look at the [[degree of freedom|degrees of freedom]], or the way an object can move in a specific space. There are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used, and there are also different definitions. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts.  
 
 In a [[vector space]]  < math > V < /math >  (with [[Vector|vectors]] being  " arrows "  with directions), the dimension of  < math > V < /math > , also written as  < math > \dim(V) < /math > , < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-25|title=Comprehensive List of Algebra Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/algebra-symbols/|access-date=2020-09-07|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref >  is equal to the [[cardinality]] (or number of vectors) of a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of  < math > V < /math > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Dimension|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html|access-date=2020-09-07|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Basis and Dimension|url=https://people.math.carleton.ca/~kcheung/math/notes/MATH1107/wk09/09_basis_and_dimension.html|access-date=2020-09-07|website=people.math.carleton.ca}} < /ref >  (a set which indicates how many unique directions  < math > V < /math >  actually has). It is also equal to the number of the largest group of straight line directions of that space.  " Normal "  objects in everyday life are specified by three dimensions, which are usually called [[length]], [[width]] and [[depth]]. Mathematicians call this concept [[Euclidean space]]. 
 
 Dimensions can be used to measure [[position]] too. The [[distance]] to a position from a [[start]]ing place can be measured in the length, width and height [[direction]]s. These distances are a measure of the position. 
 
 In some occasions, a fourth ([[4D]]) dimension, [[time]], is used to show the [[position]] of an [[event]] in [[time]] and [[Space (physics)|space]]. 
 
 ==Other Dimensions== 
 In modern [[science]], people use other dimensions. Dimensions like [[temperature]] and [[weight]] can be used to show the position of something in less simple [[Space (physics)|spaces]]. Scientist study those dimensions with [[dimensional analysis]]. 
 
 [[Mathematician]]s also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the [[world]]. The [[rule]]s for doing [[arithmetic]] with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules. 
 
 ==Dimensions and vectors== 
 [[Vector]]s are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in [[engineering]] and [[science]], and sometimes in [[mathematics]]. 
 
 A vector is a list of [[number]]s. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors. 
 
 For example, if Jane wants to know the position of Sally, Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position. If Jane and Sally are in the world, there are three dimensions. Therefore, Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position. The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be: 
 # Sally's distance north of Jane 
 # Sally's distance east of Jane 
 # Sally's height above Jane
