 '''Lippstadt''' is a [[new town|planned city]] in [[Westphalia]]. About 67,000 people lived there in 2008. The city is about 70 km east of [[Dortmund]], and about 30 km west of [[Paderborn]].  
 
 ==History== 
 The city was founded in 1185. It is the oldest [[founded city]] in Westphalia. Founded cities did not grow from earlier settlements; they were made as cities from the beginning. Lippstadt is known because there were many [[witch trial]]s in the city, especially between 1565 and 1573. The [[priest]] [[Anton Praetorius]] wrote in 1613, that  " Nail-smith Ebert Balve and his sister, a [[baker]] were released from prison, despite protests from the population. They had been [[torture]]d for a long time, and they had withdrawn their [[confession]]s. "  This witchcraft trial left a lasting impression on Praetorius and may have changed his thinking. In 1597, he risked his life so that the torture of a woman be stopped. Later, he continued to fight against witch-trials and torture through his writings. There were more witch trials in Lippstadt between 1630 and 1677.
