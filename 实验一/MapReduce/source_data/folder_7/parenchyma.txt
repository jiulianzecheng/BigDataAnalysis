'''Parenchyma''' forms the bulk of plant [[ground tissue]], where they may be specialised to function in [[photosynthesis]], storage, or transport. Parenchyma is integral to vascular tissue, where it provides a route of exchange for materials within and between the [[xylem]] and the [[phloem]]. 
 
 Parenchyma refers to both a [[cell]] type and a simple [[tissue]] and is found within all three tissue systems of vascular plants: the dermal, ground (fundamental) and vascular tissue systems. 
 
 Parenchyma functions are diverse and dependant on both location within the plant and morphological specialisation. 
 
 Parenchyma is composed of living cells that retain the ability to divide and hence play a key role in several developmental processes, as well in plant response to wounding.
