 '''Chlorophyta''' are a division of [[green algae]]. < ref name= " Algaebase " > {{cite web | url = http://www.algaebase.org/browse/taxonomy/?id=4307 | publisher = AlgaeBase version 4.2 World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway | access-date = 2007-09-23 | title = Phylum: Chlorophyta taxonomy browser | author = Guiry M.D.  &  Guiry G.M. | year = 2007 }} < /ref >

 Like the land [[plants]], green algae contain [[chlorophyll]]s ''a'' and ''b'', and store food as [[starch]] < ref name= " Hoek, Mann and Jahns 95 " / >  in their [[plastid]]s. Most species are [[flagellate]] in at least one stage of their [[life cycle]]. 
 
 They are related to the [[Charophyceae]] (also called Charophyta) and land [[plants]], together making up the [[Viridiplantae]]. 
   
 The division contains both unicellular and multicellular species. While most species live in [[freshwater biology|freshwater habitats]] and a large number in [[marine biology|marine habitats]], other species are adapted to a wide range of environments. Watermelon snow, or ''Chlamydomonas nivalis'', lives on summer alpine snowfields. Others live attached to rocks or woody parts of trees. Some [[lichen]]s are symbiotic relationships between fungi and green algae. 
 
 Members of the Chlorophyta also form [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with [[protozoa]], [[sponge]]s and [[cnidaria]]ns. Some conduct [[sexual reproduction]].
