 '''''Haikouichthys''''' is an extinct early fish-like [[Craniata|craniate]]. 
 
 These creatures have backbones and distinct heads, and lived about 530 million years ago, during the [[Cambrian explosion]].   
 
 ''Haikouichthys'' had a defined skull and other characters which suggest it is a true craniate, and perhaps one of the earliest fishes. [[Cladistics|Cladistic analysis]] indicates that the animal is probably a basal [[chordate]] or a basal craniate. < ref name= " Paleos: The Cambrian: 2 " > Paleos.
