The '''hydrosphere''' is the total [[mass]] of [[water]] on, under, and over the surface of a [[planet]]. It is part of [[physical geography]]. The oceans, rivers, and lakes are all part of the hydrosphere. Some [[electricity]] is made by the hydrosphere. 
 
 The total mass of the [[Earth]]’s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 10 < sup > 24 < /sup >  [[gram]]s, which is about 0.023% of the Earth’s total mass. Around 2 × 10 < sup > 19 < /sup >  grams of this is the Earth’s [[atmosphere]]. In addition, 71% of the Earth’s surface, an area of 361 million square kilometers, is covered by [[ocean]]. < ref > World Water Resources: a new appraisal and assessment for the 21st century (Report).
