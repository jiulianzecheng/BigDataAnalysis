 '''Hororata''' is a village in the [[Selwyn District]], [[New Zealand]]. It is situated 5 kilometers east of [[Glentunnel]], 15 kilometers southwest of [[Darfield, New Zealand|Darfield]], 50 kilometers west of [[Christchurch]] and is on the banks of the [[Hororata River]]. It has a primary school which opened in 1870 and amalgamated with Te Pirita in 1963. In 2010 an earthquake struck the surrounding region and in May 2021 the golf course located in Glentunnel became unrecognisable following the flooding hit the Canterbury area. It is the home of the [[Hororata Highland Games]] since 2011.
