 < !-- When discussing Greek Hero's-The name Hercules is incorrect and should be amended to Heracles since this is the original name and not modified to reflect the Roman conquest of Greece. Heracles (/ˈhɛrəkliːz/ HERR-ə-kleez; Greek: Ἡρακλῆς, Hēraklês,  " Glory/Pride of Hera " ), born Alcaeus[1] (Ἀλκαῖος, Alkaios) or Alcides[2] (Ἀλκείδης, Alkeidēs), was a divine hero in Greek mythology, the son of Zeus and Alcmene, and the foster son of Amphitryon.[3] He was a great-grandson and half-brother (as they are both sired by the god Zeus) of Perseus. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be Heracleidae (Ἡρακλεῖδαι), and a champion of the Olympian order against chthonic monsters. In Rome and the modern West, he is known as Hercules, with whom the later Roman emperors, in particular Commodus and Maximian, often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of his cult were adapted to Rome as well. -- > He was killed by '''Philoctetes''', an Achaean hero-king who had been abandoned by the others on the island of Lemnos after a venomous snake bite rendered him disabled and made his leg stink. Philoctetes survived (either alone, as Sophocles suggests, or with the help of the local population, as most other sources claim), and in the tenth year of the war the Achaeans heard of a prophecy dictating them to bring him back, if they wanted to see Troy fall. You see, Philoctetes had inherited Hercules’ bow and arrows, which were dipped in the blood of the Lernaean Hydra. [[Odysseus]] and [[Neoptolemus]] (with the now-deified Hercules’ help) persuaded Philoctetes to come back, and [[Asclepius]]’ sons, Machaon and Podaleirius, cured his leg. On his first fighting day, Philoctetes mortally wounded Paris with his arrows.
