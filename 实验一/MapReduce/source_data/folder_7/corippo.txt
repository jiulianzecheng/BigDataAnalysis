 '''Corippo''' is a former [[municipality]] of the district [[Locarno (district)|Locarno]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Ticino]] in [[Switzerland]]. 
 
 With a population of just 17 [[As of 2004|as of December 2004]], it is the smallest municipality in Switzerland{{fact|date=April 2009}}. It has many of the things that communities many times its size has: an official website ([http://www.corippo.ch www.corippo.ch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516083225/http://www.corippo.ch/ |date=2006-05-16 }}), its own [[coat of arms]], a village [[church]], a [[restaurant]], and a [[mayor]] who leads a town council made up of three local citizens. The village has remained independent since 1822. 
 
 On 17 October 2020 the former municipalities of [[Brione (Verzasca)]], Corippo, [[Frasco]], [[Sonogno]] and [[Vogorno]] merged to form the new municipality of [[Verzasca, Switzerland|Verzasca]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.agvchapp.bfs.admin.ch/de/home |title=Applikation der Schweizer Gemeinden |year=2021 | work=bfs.admin.ch | publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |accessdate= 16 December 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Description== 
 Corippo lies in the [[Valle Verzasca|Verzasca valley]] about 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) from [[Locarno]] at the north end of the [[reservoir]] [[Lago di Vogorno|Lake Vogorno]], and 20 & nbsp;km from the border with [[Italy]]. The houses are built from the local Ticino [[granite]] with slate roofs and have changed little for several hundred years, leading the Italian writer Piero Bianconi to describe Corippo as  " Verzasca's gentlest village " .{{fact|date=April 2009}}
