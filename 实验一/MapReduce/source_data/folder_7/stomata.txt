 In [[botany]], a '''stoma''' ([[plural]] = ''stomata'') is a tiny opening or [[pore]]. It is found on plant leaves and stems, and any other green parts of the plant. It is used for [[gas]] exchange. Stomata are mostly found on the ''under-surface'' of [[plant]] [[leaf|leaves]]. < ref > Swarthout, Debbie and Hogan, C. Michael 2010. Stomata. ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC. [http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156262/] < /ref >   all  plants have stomata. 
 
 Stomata have two main functions. First is gaseous exchange i.e. intake of [[carbon dioxide]] and release of [[oxygen]]. The second is the process of [[transpiration]] in plants. 
 
 Air enters the plant through these openings. The [[carbon dioxide]] is used in [[photosynthesis]], which also produces [[oxygen]]. The plant uses some of the oxygen but the rest is waste that exits through these same openings. Also, [[water vapor]] goes into the atmosphere through these pores in [[transpiration]]. 
 
 The pore is formed by a pair of cells known as '''guard cells'''. These adjust the size of the opening by opening or closing. To open a guard cell, [[proton]]s  (hydrogen ions, H < sup > + < /sup > ) are pumped into the guard cells. Water enters into them, the cells gets filled, and they open.
