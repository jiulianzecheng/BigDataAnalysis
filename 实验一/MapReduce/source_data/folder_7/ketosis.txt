 '''Ketosis''' is when there are greater levels of [[ketone]] bodies in the [[blood]] or [[urine]]. It comes when [[ketone]] bodies are released into the bloodstream due to low [[glycogen]] levels in the [[liver]]. Ketone bodies are made by a process called [[ketogenesis]]. Ketosis can be understood as the use of body fat as a source of energy. Ketosis has 3 main sources of energy, also known as ketone bodies: [[acetoacetate]], [[acetone]], and [[beta-hydroxybutyrate]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ketone Body - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/ketone-body|access-date=2021-05-03|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref >
