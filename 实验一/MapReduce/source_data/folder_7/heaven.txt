 '''Heaven''', also known as '''[[Paradise]]''', the '''Garden''' or '''Kingdom Come''', is a place where good people go when they die. It is a [[concept]] of the [[afterlife]] (what happens after somebody [[death|dies]]) in many [[religion]]s. Some [[people]] who believe in heaven say it is a [[perfect]] place. They believe heaven is where people go after they die if they have been good in life. Some people also believe in [[Hell]], a place bad people go when they die if they have been bad in life. Ideas of Heaven and [[Hell]] are not the same in all [[religion]] < nowiki/ > s. 
 
 ==In Christianity== 
 According to the [[Bible]], there are different meanings for the word: 
 *''[[Sky]]'' – the [[atmosphere]] that covers the [[Earth]]. The first time that it rained, it says, God opened  " the windows of heaven. " < ref > {{bibleverse||Genesis|7:11,12}} < /ref > 
 *''[[Outer space]]'' – the [[sun]], [[moon]], [[stars]], [[planet]] < nowiki/ > s, etc. < ref > {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:1}} < /ref > 
 *The place where [[God]] lives and rules [[eternal]]ly. < ref > {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:34}} < /ref >  The people called [[prophet]]s in the Bible, like [[Isaiah]], often spoke of a physical Kingdom of Heaven that will occupy a new Earth, and ruled by God ([[Messiah]]) in the flesh himself, where we will have physical bodies that do not die. 
 
 The Bible does not have a lot to say about what it looks like. The [[Paul the Apostle|apostle Paul]] tells about a [[vision]] he had of being taken up to  " the third heaven, "  where he saw and heard things too wonderful to describe. < ref > {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:1–4}} < /ref >  But, much of what Christians believe Heaven to be like comes from the vision that John saw in a vision while praying, < ref > {{bibleverse||Revelation|22}} < /ref >  including: 
 *The glory of God is the light (no sun) 
 *Heaven is where all the true believers go.  
 *You never sleep because of your purified new body 
 *Has 12 gates made of [[pearl]] 
 *Walls made of [[jasper]] 
 *Streets made of pure [[gold]] 
 *A [[river]] of life 
 *Trees on each side of the river < ref name=ABF > {{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=978-1603207782|pages=104–105}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Catholic]]s believe [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] is the [[Queen of Heaven]], < ref > [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/ Pius XII: Encyclicals] < /ref >  officially defined by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1954. However many [[Protestant]]s see this as not in the [[Bible]]. 
 
 ==In Islam== 
 {{main|Jannah}} 
 According to the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], Heaven is a place of reward for those believers who accept the true faith and practices the teaching of Prophet Muhammad. The eternal life will be perfect, with thousands of types of food and clothing more beautiful than humans could ever imagine. There will also be no sad feelings, stress or pain and related problems of life. < ref > {{qref|13|35|b=yl}}, {{qref|18|31|b=y}}, {{qref|38|49-54|b=y}}, {{qref|35|33-35|b=y}}, {{qref|52|17-27|b=y}} < /ref > 
 
 ==In Bahá'í Faith==

The [[Aqdas]], the holy book of Baha'is, along with other Baha'i books, describe heaven as a  " spiritual condition "  where being close to [[God]] is called heaven. [[Hell]] is seen as being separated from God. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, said that the [[afterlife]] is beyond human understanding. < ref name= " lafd " > {{cite book | title = Life After Death: A study of the afterlife in world religions | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeafterdeathst0000masm | last = Masumian | first = Farnaz | publisher = Oneworld Publications | location = Oxford | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-85168-074-8}} < /ref >
