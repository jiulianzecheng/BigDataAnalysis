'''Cambium''' is a tissue in [[Plant|plants]] which is made of dividing cells. In trees it is found between [[phloem]] and [[xylem]] tissue. 
 
 There are several types of cambium depending on where it is in a tree or plant. Usually we only see the [[cork cambium]], which makes the tough outer layer, the [[bark]]. Unlike the bark, cambium is made of living cells. They are one of the ways in which trees can go on growing for many years.
