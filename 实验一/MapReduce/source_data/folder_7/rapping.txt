That stands for Master of Ceremonies. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Rap: description of the genre, popular tracks|url=https://muzzona.info/music/rap/|access-date=|website=}} < /ref > 
 
 Rapping can be done over music of many types (or [[Musical genre|genres]]), including [[jazz]], [[House music|house]], [[reggae]] and many more.

People would talk over [[Disco|disco music]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] < nowiki/ > s at parties, and this gradually evolved into rapping. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Birth of Rap: A Look Back|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7550286|access-date=2020-11-23|website=NPR.org|language=en}} < /ref >  But, the start of the art of rapping is even older.
