 '''Kami''' (神) is a [[Japan]]ese word for the [[spirit]]s that are [[worship]]ped in the [[Shinto]] religion. Not all of Kami are [[Deity|gods]] of the [[personification|personified]] type. Instead, they have to do with [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and [[event]]s like the growth of [[tree]]s, or [[rain]], or [[wind]], or other aspects of [[Nature]]; it is believed that these kami live in those natural things.  
 
 It is usually said that there are {{nihongo| " yaoyorozu-no-kami " |八百万の神|eight-million Kami}}. In Japanese the number  " eight-million "  is normally used to mean [[infinity]]. 
 
 Though the word ''kami'' can be translated multiple ways into [[English language|English]], no English word expresses its full meaning.
