 '''Pinball''' is a type of [[arcade game]]. In pinball, the player tries to score points by [[wikt:manipulating|manipulating]] one or more [[metal]] balls on a [[playfield]] inside a [[glass]]-covered case called a '''pinball machine'''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460818/pinball-machine |title=pinball machine (game) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2011-11-01}} < /ref >  The main [[wikt:objective|objective]] of the game is to score as many points as the player can. Other objectives are to play as long as possible (by earning ''extra balls'' and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn free games (known as ''replays''). 
 
 From the 1940s through the 1970s pinball was banned in many American cities because it was thought to be a game of chance and therefore was considered [[gambling]]. < ref > Porges, Seth.
