 '''Panamarenko''' (pseudonym of '''Henri Van Herwegen'''; 5 February 1940 â€“ 14 December 2019) was a famous [[Assemblage (art)|assemblagist]] in [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[sculpture]]. He is famous for his work with airplanes as theme. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.galeriejamar.be/panamarenko.php|title=Panamarenko|website=www.galeriejamar.be|access-date=2014-09-21|archive-date=2018-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914140935/http://www.galeriejamar.be/panamarenko.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   None of the airplanes are able to actually leave the ground. 
 
 Panamarenko studied at the academy of Antwerp. Before 1968, his art was inspired by [[Pop art]].  Early on he became interested in [[fixed-wing aircraft|plane]]s and human powered flight.  This interest is also shown in his name.  It is supposed to be an [[acronym]] for  " Pan American Airlines and Company " . 
 
 Starting in 1970, he developed his first models of imaginary vehicles, planes, [[balloon]]s or [[helicopter]]s. Many of his sculptures are modern versions of the myth of [[Icarus]]. 
 
 In [[2003]] Panamarenko married the 34 year younger Eveline Hoorens. At the opening of a large-scale overview exhibition of his work in [[Brussels]] in 2005, Panamarenko said he was retiring as an artist.  He has since had his own coffee brand PanamaJumbo. 
 
 On 24 April 2009, [[VLM Airlines]] named one of its [[Fokker 50]] aircraft in his honour.
