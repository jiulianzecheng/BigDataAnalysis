 '''Lipopolysaccharides''' ('''LPS'''), also known as lipoglycans, are large [[molecule]]s made of a [[lipid]] and a [[polysaccharide]] joined by a [[covalent bond]]. 
 
 They occur in the outer membrane of [[Gram-negative]] [[bacteria]], and  act as triggers for the [[innate immune system]]. Their presence is sensed by [[toll-like receptor]]s on [[dendritic cell]]s. This causes a strong [[immune response]] in animals.
