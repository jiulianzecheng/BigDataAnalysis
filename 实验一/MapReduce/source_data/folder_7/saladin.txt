 '''Yusuf ibn Ayyub ibn Shadhi''' (25 December 1138–1193), better known as '''Saladin''', was a famous [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Islam|Muslim]] Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] during [[the Crusades]]. < ref > Sultan is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word from old [[Assyrian]] means power, rule, government, later as a kings title. < /ref >   
 
 A [[Islam|Muslim]] of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] origin, < ref name= " Minorsky " > A number of contemporary sources make note of this. The biographer Ibn Khallikan writes,  " Historians agree in stating that [Saladin's] father and family belonged to Duwin [Dvin]. & nbsp;... They were Kurds and belonged to the Rawādiya (sic), which is a branch of the great tribe al-Hadāniya " : Minorsky (1953), p. 124. The medieval historian Ibn Athir, who is a Kurd and therefore his credibility is questionable, relates a passage from another commander:  " ... & nbsp;both you and Saladin are Kurds and you will not let power pass into the hands of the Turks " : Minorsky (1953), p. 138. < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |first=R.

At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Hejaz]], [[Yemen]] and other parts of [[North Africa]]. 
 
 His father, who worked for the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] governor, decided to raise him in [[Syria]] where he received his education. Another influential figure in his life was his uncle Shirkuh who was a military leader and later commanded for Saladin during the wars. < ref > " Saladin and Richard the Lionhearted. "  World History: Ancient and Medieval Eras. ABC-CLIO, 2013. Web. 27 Feb. 2013. < /ref >  The [[Muslim world]] consider him a [[hero]] for defeating the [[Crusaders]] over 20 years of battles and capturing their capital, [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Crusades]] were a series of battles between Christian Europe and Islamic Middle East over holy land in what is now known as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Saladin’s army protected [[Egypt]] from the Crusaders in 1168.   
 
 The ruler of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of Egypt made him Vizier, meaning [[prime minister]], even though he was not a [[Shia]]. Just before the Caliph died, Saladin was crowned Sultan of Egypt and Syria. < ref > Giacumakis, George , Jr.  " Saladin. "  World Book Advanced. World Book, 2013. Web.  27 Feb. 2013 < /ref >  His greatest victory was at the Horns of [[Hattin]] in July 1187 AD, after which [[Jerusalem]] fell to the Muslim army (October 1187) and was never again recovered by the [[Crusader]]s. He is also remembered for his series of battles and wins and losses against King [[Richard I of England]]. These were inconclusive and in the end resulted in a moral victory for Sultan Salah ad-Din, when Richard's Crusade failed and returned to Europe. < ref > Philip K Hitti, ''History of the Arabs'', London, 1949 ed, pp.650-651 < /ref > 
 
 He founded the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] of Egypt, [[Syria]], [[Yemen]] (except for the Northern Mountains), [[Iraq]], [[Mecca]] [[Hejaz]] and [[Diyarbakır]]. Salah ad-Din is a title which translates to ''The Righteousness of the Faith'' from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. 
 
 Many books were written about Saladin, the things he did and the battles he won. ''Daastaan Imaan Farooshoon Ki'' is one book in [[Urdu]] written by [[Althamash]] that says very good things about Saladin and compares and contrasts him to other kings and princes, in a favourable light.
