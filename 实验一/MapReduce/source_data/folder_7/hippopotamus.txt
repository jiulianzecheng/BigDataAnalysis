 < /gallery > The '''hippopotamus''' (''Hippopotamus amphibius''), or '''hippo''', [[ancient Greek]] for  " river horse "  (''Ιπποπόταμος''), is a large [[mammal]] from [[Africa]] that usually eats [[herbivore|plants]]. It is one of only two [[species]] in the [[scientific classification|family]] [[Hippopotamidae]] that are still alive. The other is the [[pygmy hippopotamus]]. 
 
 The hippopotamus is the second largest land animal in size and the third largest land animal in weight. The [[elephant]] is the heaviest and the [[white rhinoceros]] is the second heaviest, but a bit smaller than the hippo. The hippo is also the heaviest [[Even-toed ungulate|artiodactyl]]. 
 
 The hippopotamus is semi-aquatic. This means that even though it usually lives on the land, it spends a great amount of time in [[rivers]] and [[lakes]] where males lead groups of 5 to 30 females and young. In the daytime, they keep cool by staying in the [[water]] or [[mud]]. They give birth to baby hippos in the water, too. At [[dusk]], they come out to [[grazing|graze]] on [[grass]]. Hippopotamuses rest together in the water, but they like to graze by themselves. 
 
 The hippopotamus has: a [[torso]] that is shaped like a [[barrel]], a very big mouth and teeth, an almost hairless body, short legs and great size. It is the third largest land mammal, judging by its weight, which is between between 1½ and 3 [[tonne]]s. The white rhinoceros weighs 1½ to 3½ tonnes and the three species of elephant weigh 3 to 9 tonnes. Even though it has short, fat legs, it can run more quickly than a human. Some hippos have run at 30 [[kilometer|km]]/[[hour|h]] (19 & nbsp;mph) for short distances. The hippopotamus is one of the [[wikt:fierce|fiercest]] animals in the world. It is often called one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. There are about 125,000 to 150,000 hippos in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. [[Zambia]] (about 40,000) and [[Tanzania]] (20,000–30,000) have the most hippos. They are [[wikt:threat|threatened]] because they are losing their habitats and being [[poaching|poached]] for their meat and [[ivory]] teeth. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The word  " hippopotamus "  comes from the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|ἱπποπόταμος}}, ''hippopotamos'', from {{Polytonic|ἵππος}}, ''hippos'',  " horse "  and {{polytonic|ποταμός}}, ''potamos'', which means  " river " . So,  " hippopotamus "  means  " horse of the river " . < ref > [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hippopotamus Hippopotamus] from Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary] < /ref >  [[Plural|More than one]] hippopotamus are called ''hippopotami'', and 'hippopotamuses' or 'hippos' is also used. < ref > [http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/plurals?view=uk Plural of hippopotamus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013041855/http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/plurals?view=uk |date=2008-10-13 }} from the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] < /ref >  Hippopotami are social. About 30 hippos live together in groups. A male hippopotamus is known as a bull. A female hippopotamus is called a cow and a baby hippo is called a calf. The species is also known as the common hippopotamus or the [[Nile]] hippopotamus. 
 
 == Description ==

 [[File:Mouth of a hippo.jpg|thumb|Inside the mouth of a hippopotamus]] 
 
 Hippopotami are the fourth largest mammals in the world (after [[whales]], elephants and rhinoceroses). The Egyptian hippopotamus is smaller than the others. They can live in the water or on land. They can walk or even run along the bottom of a river. 
 
 Because hippos are so large, it is difficult to weigh them in the wild. Most adult male hippos weigh between {{cvt|1500|–|1800|kg}}. Females hippos are smaller and usually weigh between {{cvt|1300|–|1500|kg}}. Older males can get even bigger. They are at least {{cvt|3200|kg}} and sometimes even weigh {{cvt|4500|kg}}. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://whozoo.org/Intro98/herrick/sethherr.htm |title=Hippopotamus: WhoZoo |publisher=Whozoo.org |accessdate=2008-11-03}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Hippopotamus_amphibius.html |title=ADW: Hippopotamus amphibius: Information |publisher=Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu |accessdate=2008-11-03}} < /ref > 
 
 Male hippos seem to keep on growing for their whole lives. Females hippos, though, become the heaviest when they are about 25 years old. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Marshall P.J. |author2=Sayer J.A. | title = Population ecology and response to cropping of a hippopotamus population in eastern Zambia | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | year = 1976 | journal = The Journal of Applied Ecology | pages = 391–403 | doi = 10.2307/2401788|jstor=2401788 }} < /ref > 
 
 Hippos have big and heavy bodies, dark gray skin and short legs. A hippo's main defence is their extremely strong mouth. They can grow to be 15 & nbsp;feet long and weigh 3,000 & nbsp;pounds. < ref name= " hippo " > {{cite book |title= LIFEPAC|last= History and Geography|date= March 2001|authorlink= Theresa K.

 == Life == 
 Hippopotami are [[herbivore]]s which live in groups. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom. < ref name= " Estes " > {{cite book| last = Estes| first = Richard| title = The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_0520080858| year = 1991| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-08085-0| page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_0520080858/page/222 222] }} < /ref >  They usually stay in the mud and water during the day and come out to eat grass or leaves at night. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotami can gallop at 30 & nbsp;km/h (19 & nbsp;mph) on land but normally trot. < ref name=Estes/ > 
 
 ==Distribution== 
 Many hippos lived in [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]] < ref > {{cite journal |last=van Kolfschoten |first=Th. |authorlink= |year=2000 |title=The Eemian mammal fauna of central Europe |journal=Netherlands Journal of Geosciences |volume=79 |issue=2/3 |pages=269–281 |doi=10.1017/S0016774600021752 |s2cid=234349144 |id= |url=http://www.njgonline.nl/publish/articles/000099/article.pdf |accessdate= |quote= }} < /ref >  until about 30,000 years ago. They used to be common in [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile]] region from long ago, though they are not there now. [[Pliny the Elder]] writes that, in his time, the best place in Egypt for finding this animal was in Sais. < ref name= " Pliny " > {{cite book | title = [[Naturalis Historia]] | author = [[Pliny the Elder]] | chapter = Chapter 15, Book VIII |id=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny8.html English translation] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/8*.html Latin]}} < /ref >  The animal could still be found around there after the Arab Conquest in 639. Hippos are still found in the rivers and lakes of: [[Uganda]], [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]], west through [[Ghana]] to [[Gambia]] and also in [[Southern Africa]] ([[Botswana]], [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]]). Some hippos also live in [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]]. They like to live in places with water that is not too deep. 
 
 ==Hippos and humans==

 === Aggression === 
 Hippos are very aggressive towards humans, whom they commonly attack whether in boats or on land with no apparent provocation. This aggression by the hippopotamus is caused by humans coming too close to their children. Hippopotami are very protective of their young and they often fear that humans pose a large threat to their young. < ref name= " straightdope2006 " > {{cite news |url = http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mhippo.html |title = Are hippos the most dangerous animal? |work =  |date = 2006-12-06 |accessdate = 2008-08-09 |archive-date = 2008-05-15 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515130931/http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mhippo.html |url-status = dead }} < /ref >  They are widely considered to be one of the most dangerous large animals in Africa. < ref > [http://www1.natgeochannel.co.uk/explore/hippoundercover Dangerous Encounters: Undercover Hippo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217092401/http://www1.natgeochannel.co.uk/explore/hippoundercover |date=2008-12-17 }}.

 === Archaeology === 
 The earliest proof that humans were involved with hippos comes from [[butcher]]y cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation from around 160,000 years ago. < ref name= " Clark " > Clark J.D. ''et al'' 2003. Stratigraphic, chronological and behavioural contexts of Pleistocene ''Homo sapiens'' from Middle Awash, Ethiopia. ''Nature''. '''423'''(6941):747-52. PMID 12802333 < /ref >  Later rock paintings and engravings showing hippos being hunted. They have been found in the mountains of the central [[Sahara]] from 4,000 to 5,000 years ago near Djanet. [[Ancient Egypt]]ians also knew much about hippos. They knew the hippo was a fierce, wild animal that lived in the [[Nile]]. In Egyptian [[mythology]], [[Tawaret]], a goddess of protection in pregnancy and childbirth, had the head of a hippo. This was because ancient Egyptians saw how protective female hippopotami could be about their young. < ref > {{cite book| last = Hart| first = George| title = A Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses| url = https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofegyp0000hart| year = 1986| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-05909-1 }} < /ref >
