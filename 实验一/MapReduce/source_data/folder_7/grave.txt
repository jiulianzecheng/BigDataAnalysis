 A '''grave''', or '''burial spot''' is where somebody or something is [[Burial|buried]] after they have [[death|died]]. Graves are usually placed in a [[graveyard]], with a [[headstone]] used to identify the dead person. A [[funeral]] will occur if the family has enough money. If they do not, there will not be a proper funeral. The name on the grave is of the dead person. For example, [[William Shakespeare]] was buried in [[England]].
