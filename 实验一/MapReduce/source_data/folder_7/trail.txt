 A '''trail''' is a [[pedestrian]] path or [[road]] mainly used for [[walking]], but often also for [[cycling]], cross-country [[skiing]] or other activities.  Some trails are off-limits to everyone other than [[hiking|hikers]], and few trails allow motorized [[vehicle]]s. In wilderness areas where no roads suitable to wheeled vehicles exist, pedestrian trails are the main way of going places. For example in 1942 in New Guinea, the Japanese and Australian armies fought for control of the Kokoda Track, a rugged foot trail that was a main route across eastern New Guinea. 
 
 == Nomenclature == 
 In the [[United States]], the word '''footpath''' is also used to mean a trail; however in [[Australian English]], [[New Zealand English]], [[Indian English]], and [[Irish English]] this word means  " [[sidewalk]] "  ([[American English]]) or  " [[pavement]] "  ([[British English]]). 
 
 In [[Australia]], the word '''track''' can be used interchangeably with '''trail''', and can refer to anything from a [[dirt road]] to a pedestrian walkway (generally also unpaved). The term  " trail "  gained popularity during [[World War II]], when many [[servicemen]] from the [[United States]] were stationed in Australia, which probably influenced its being adopted by elements of the Australian media at the time. In [[New Zealand]], the word '''track''' is used almost exclusively except in reference to [[cross-country skiing]], where '''trail''' is used. 
 
 == Trail types and use == 
 === Walking trails ===

 Trail use has become very popular for a wide variety of users. Some trails are meant as '''nature trails''', and are used by people learning about the natural world. Many trails are '''day trails''', what means that they are generally used by people out for a short hike, less than a day. Some trails are '''backpacking trails''', or [[long-distance trail]]s, and are used by both day [[Hiking|hikers]] and by [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]]. Some of the trails are over a thousand miles (1,500 km) long and may be hiked in sections by backpackers, or completed in one trip by dedicated hikers. Some trails are specifically used by other outdoor enthusiasts to gain access to another feature, such as good [[climbing]] sites. Many [[Running|runners]] also favor running on trails rather than pavement, as giving a more vigorous work-out and better developing agility skills, as well as providing a more pleasant exercise environment. See [[trail running]]. 
 
 ==== Stairway Trails ====

 [[Stairs|Stairway]] is another way to ascend higher slopes. Stairway trails are usually for walking only. The stairs are constructed using cuts in dirt, rocks or concrete. Popular stairway trails include Stairway Trails in [[Bernal Heights]] East - [[San Francisco]], Stairs at many hill top [[Hindu temple]] ([[Tirumala]], [[Palani Murugan Temple|Palani]]) used during [[Pilgrimage#Hinduism|Pilgrimage]]  &  [[Machu Picchu]]. 
 
 === Bicycle trails === 
 
 Recent decades have seen an explosion of interest in [[bicycling|cycling]], both street-type and [[Mountain biking|off-road]] type. A common term for these facilities is simply  " bike trail " . These trails may be built to a different set of standards than foot trails, requiring more stable, harder surfaces, less strenuous [[grade (slope)|grade]]s, longer sight visibility, and less sharp changes in direction. On the other hand, the cross-slope of a bike trail may be significantly greater than a foot trail, and the actual treadway may be narrower in some cases. 
 
 === Equestrian trails === 
 
 [[Horseback riding]] has continued to be a popular activity for many trail users. Again, '''horse trails''' are built to different standards than other trails.  Sight distance is an important issue with horse trails, as is overhead and side clearance.  While trail surface types are a relatively unimportant issue with hikers, they may be an important issue with horses.  
 
 === Cross-country skiing === 
 
 In [[cross-country skiing]], a trail (also called a 'track' or 'piste') refers to the parallel [[groove]]s cut into the [[snow]], one for each [[ski]]. 
 
 === Motorized trails === 
 
 Motorized trail use also remains very popular with some people. Such terms as ''ORV'', ''four-wheeling'', ''all-terrain vehicle'', and others actually have highly specific meanings.
