 A '''Troll''' is a Nordic mythological [[creature]], may be: [[elf|elves]], [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], or [[monster]]s. Is a usually a giant that lives in caverns or undergrounds. It is also a well known internet meme. 
 
 They are quite short in stature and are violent in nature as their name suggests. Their appearance is similar to that of a [[goblin]]. They tend to live in caves and under bridges. Some say they are huge others say they're dwarves. These monsters live under bridges, in burrows underground or in caves. They rarely leave their lairs during the day because sunlight turns them into stone. Water trolls are agile in water but clumsy on land. But they all have strong teeth and jaws.
