'''Pneumoconiosis''' is a form of occupational [[lung]] [[disease]] that is not [[Infection|infective]]. It is a progressive (gets worse with time) degenerative disorder. It is caused by [[air pollution]] in the form of tiny particles. It was common among [[coal]] [[miner]]s, who inhaled coal dust regularly. 
 
 Another type of pneumoconiosis is '[[asbestosis]]', caused by inhaling [[asbestos]] fibers. A third type is caused by inhaling very small [[silica]] particles, called '[[silicosis]]'. All forms of pneuomoconiosis shorten life, and have no cure. 
 
 Indications: 
 #Having worked at an occupation with dust risks 
 #Shortness of breath 
 #Chest [[X-ray]] may show typical signs
