People in the comic often [[time travel]] to the [[past]] or the [[future]]. This creates many possible or imagined stories that all happen at the same time. < ref name= " Atlantic "  / > 
 
 At first, Hussie wanted his [[Fan (person)|fans]] (people who are interested in something) to make the choices for the story. He later decided that this was too complicated, so he made more of the choices himself. Many fans wrote their ideas for Homestuck on [[blog]]s and [[internet forum]]s. Hussie sometimes added these ideas to the story. < ref name= " Faircloth " > {{cite news |first1=Kelly |last1=Faircloth |title=Stuck on Homestuck: How Andrew Hussie Turned a Tumblr Craze Into a Teenage Empire |url=http://betabeat.com/2012/10/tumblr-andrew-hussie-homestuck-kickstarter-game-adventure-text-teens-young-adult/ |newspaper=The New York Observer |series=Betabeat |date=October 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005192003/http://betabeat.com/2012/10/tumblr-andrew-hussie-homestuck-kickstarter-game-adventure-text-teens-young-adult |archive-date=October 5, 2012 |language=en}} < /ref >  Fans also made a lot of the artwork and music for the comic. In 2012, Hussie said that he was in control of the comic, but he was not in control of the  " [[movement]] "  of Homestuck. < ref name= " Atlantic "  / > 
 
 Homestuck was very popular, especially among [[teenager]]s. About a million people came to the website each day. Fans gave over 2 million dollars on [[Kickstarter]] to make a video game for the story. < ref name= " Faircloth "  / >
