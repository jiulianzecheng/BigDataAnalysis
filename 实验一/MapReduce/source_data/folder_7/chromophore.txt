A '''chromophore''' is the part of a [[molecule]] responsible for its [[colour]]. < ref > [[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01076.html Chromophore] < /ref > 
 
 The colour is caused when a molecule [[Absorption|absorbs]] certain [[wavelength]]s of [[visible spectrum|visible light]]. It transmits or reflects only other wavelengths, which causes the colour we see. 
 
 In biological molecules that capture or detect light energy, the chromophore is the [[Functional group|part of the molecule]] which responds when hit by light.

 Chromophores make the colour in [[chromatophore]]s, which are the [[pigment]]-containing and light-reflecting cells found in many animals.
