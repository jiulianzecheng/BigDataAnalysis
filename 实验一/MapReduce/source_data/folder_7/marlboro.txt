 == Motorsport sponsorship == 
 === Formula One === 
 [[File:BRM P180.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marlboro's motorsport sponsorship started with the BRM Formula One team in 1972.]] 
 Marlboro is also known for its sponsorship of [[auto racing]]. This started in {{F1|1972}} with its sponsorship of [[Formula One]] teams [[BRM]] and [[Frank Williams Racing Cars|Iso Marlboro]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. 
 
 For {{F1|1974}} season Marlboro ended its sponsorship of both teams. Marlboro became associated with the [[McLaren]] team. Marlboro ended their sponsorship of McLaren in {{F1|1996}}, which ended the famous red and white McLaren livery. 
 
 Marlboro also sponsored [[Scuderia Ferrari]] as secondary sponsor starting in 1980s Ferrari company president [[Enzo Ferrari]] refused to allow  " outside "  sponsor brands to appear on his team cars. After Enzo Ferrari's death in 1988, Marlboro began to take over as the primary sponsor. Later the team was officially named Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro.[[Image:Marlboro-Ferrari.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Prominent Marlboro branding on [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] Formula One car and team at the {{F1|2006}} [[Bahrain Grand Prix]].]] 
 
 In September 2005, Ferrari signed an extension of their sponsorship arrangement with Marlboro until 2011. This came at a time when tobacco sponsorship was being banned in many location. It had become illegal in the European Union, including F1 races. Other major teams have withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies. In April 2008, the Marlboro logo was displayed on the Ferrari for the last time. 
 
 Marlboro then replaced the logo with a variety of barcodes. Leading health officials called for a review of the barcode advertising. < ref > http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/29042010/58/ferrari-spotlight-subliminal-tobacco-ads.html ''Eurosport Yahoo News'', April 29, 2010 < /ref >   The Ferrari team claims the barcode is part of the car design, not an advertising message. < ref > http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article7111124.ece ''The Times'', April 29, 2010 < /ref >  The controversial barcode designed was recently removed by Ferrari for the start of the {{F1|2010}} [[Spanish Grand Prix]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2010-05-07-1751651542_x.htm|title=Ferrari removes bar code design from car - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}} < /ref >

 Marlboro sponsorship in [[Champ Car]] (also known as 'CART' and 'IndyCar' at that time) dates back to 1986. The [[Penske Racing|Penske]] cars in the [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) currently run in Marlboro's distinctive red and white colors. In 2006, a Marlboro-sponsored car won the [[Indianapolis 500]]. For the 2007 season, Marlboro had ended their sponsorship of the Penske Cars. The Penske team will retain the color scheme. Where 'Marlboro Penske' appeared on the side of the cars, 'Team Penske' replaced it.  Although Marlboro does not sponsor Team Penske, Philip Morris USA is still Team Penske's main sponsor. 
 
 Marlboro also sponsored the Australian Marlboro [[Holden Dealer Team]] from 1974 through to 1984. The Marlboro branding gave rise to some of Australia's most prominently recognizable race cars such as the L34 and A9X [[Holden Torana|Torana]], as well as the VK Group C  " Big Banger "  [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]]. 
 
 In Motorcycling Grand Prix, Marlboro sponsored the [[Yamaha]] team in 500cc and 250cc class. Marlboro currently sponsors the [[Ducati]] [[MotoGP]]. As of the 2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, they are only allowed to put the Marlboro brand the bikes in [[Qatar]]. 
 
 Marlboro also has a long history in rallying sponsorship, including with the factory [[World Rally Championship]] teams of [[Toyota Team Europe|Toyota]], [[Mitsubishi Ralliart|Mitsubishi]], and [[Peugeot#Rallying|Peugeot]]. During the [[2007 GP2 Series Season]], [[ART Grand Prix]] was also sponsored by Marlboro. 
 
 Marlboro are generally credited as being among the most important of sponsors to the world of Formula 1 (and motor racing in general) in terms of the amount of financial backing given to various competitors.
