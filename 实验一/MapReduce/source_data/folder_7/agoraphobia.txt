 # One more phobia. 
 # A history of agoraphobia in the family. 
 # Maltreatment or trauma in the past. 
 # Cognitive chemistry. 
 # Depression or low self-esteem. 
 
 * Moreover, learned associations may contribute to the emergence of agoraphobia. 
 * The concern that a panic attack may happen again in the future can develop after having one in a particular circumstance or place. 
 * In some circumstances, agoraphobia can be exacerbated by '''post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).''' 
 * Following a traumatic experience, PTSD can develop and cause feelings of '''anxiety and hypervigilance,''' which can trigger the development of agoraphobia. 
 * The risk of acquiring agoraphobia may be increased by prolonged solitude. 
 * For instance, the terror brought on by the '''COVID-19 pandemic''' paired with the isolation brought on by social exclusion and quarantines has made many Americans more anxious. 
 * According to mental health professionals, the effects of these incidents could continue for years and affect both grown-up and children's well-being.
