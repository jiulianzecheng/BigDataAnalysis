 == History == 
 === Founding === 
 Ramla was founded in around 705 to 715 AD by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] (modern-day [[Syria]]) prince Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, replacing ''Lydda'' (Lod), the original provincial capital of the Muslims. He saw the city as an advantage for economics due to it's strategical location, thus being attacked many times by the Muslims, while they only succeeded twice. A few centuries later, in the Fatimid period it served as the capital of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It's role as a capital was shortly ended after the [[First Crusade]] came in 1099. The city got it's name through the word ''ramil'' (Arabicː رمل) which means 'sand', from the sandy terrain it was located in. 
 
 === Abbasids === 
 In 750, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] conquered many parts of the [[Middle East]], including mainland Israel, thus getting control of the city. They demolished many properties of the Umayyads. They ruled during the golden age of Ramla, when they took control of Jeruslaem as a trade center. The golden age also existed during the previous Umayyad dynasty. However reconquered the city a second time between 905 and 969, which 10 years later in 979 the city was demolished by the [[Jarrahids]], a branch of the ancient [[Banu Tayy|Banu Tayy]] tribe. 
 
 === Crusades === 
 In 1101, the Crusades took control after the First ''Ramla'' War against the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]], making the Muslim population leave. They made Ramla a city of major economic importance and an important station for [[pilgrims]] traveling to [[Jerusalem]]. They identified it with the [[Hebrew Bible|bibical]] city of Ramathaim, thus naming it ''Arimathea''. One year later, in 1102, the ''Second'' Ramla War occurred and the Fatimids won the war, having much more strength than the Crusades, thus taking control of the city in the same day the battle occurred. Later, in 1105 the Crusades won thus retaking the city. The Malmuk unsuccessful wars led to the War of Yibneh (Modern day [[Yavne]]) in 1123, which the Crusades won again. 
 
 === Modern Era === 
 In 1889, 31 Jewish families migrated to Ramla, thus making them the first Jews in Ramla, which didn't have them until this timeline. When the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate]] came, they made the ''Ramle'' subdistrict (Southeast part in the Central District today), which was located near the ''Jaffa'' subdistrict. After the 1948 Palestine War the Ramle subdistrict became part of the [[Central District (Israel)|Central District]] which exists to this day. 
 
 Before the [[Arabs]] were expulsed because of the wars in 1948, Ramla had a major Arab demographic, thus after the explusion the [[Jew|Jews]] claimed the major demographic. Today, there are around 76% Jews and 24% Arabs in Ramla, being one of the mixed cities in the center and all Israel, which is more common in the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]] and [[Galilee]] which has Arab majority demographics. Examples are [[Ka'abiyye-Tabbash-Hajajre]], [[Sakhnin]] and [[Nazareth]].
