 '''Bermuda''' (/bɜrˈmjuːdə/  " Ber-myu-dah " ; officially, '''the Bermudas''' or '''Somers Islands''') is a [[British]] overseas [[territory]] in the North [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The land has one main [[island]] and 180 smaller islands. Bermuda is a popular [[Tourism|tourist]] place, with mild [[weather]] during the winter months. 
 
 Off the east [[coast]] of the [[United States]], Bermuda's nearest landmass is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], about 1,030 kilometres (640 & nbsp;mi) to the west-northwest. It is about 1,373 kilometres (853 & nbsp;mi) south of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], and 1,770 kilometres (1,100 & nbsp;mi) northeast of [[Miami, Florida]]. Its [[capital (city)|capital]] city is [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:HamiltonStreet.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Street in Hamilton (the [[capital (city)|capital]] city).]] 
 {{nowrap|Bermuda was discovered}} in 1505 by Spanish navigator [[Juan de Bermúdez]] (who said it to be inhabited only with [[pig]]s), after whom the islands are named. Bermúdez claimed it for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Unoccupied, the island was settled by England in 1609, making it the oldest and most [[population|populous]] remaining British overseas territory. Its first capital, St George's, was founded in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the [[Americas]]. < ref name= " SM " > " Bermuda – History and Heritage " . Smithsonian.com. 6 November 2007, webpage:[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination- < !-- 
    -- > hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html SM-Bermuda]. < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 The country is in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], near the western edge of the [[Sargasso Sea]].  It is about 580 [[nautical miles]] (1070 & nbsp;km, 670 & nbsp;mi) east-southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]] on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] and about 590 nautical miles (1100 & nbsp;km, 690 & nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. The island is due east of [[Fripp Island]], [[South Carolina]]. It has 103 & nbsp;km (64 & nbsp;mi) of coastline. 
 
 The territory has 181 islands.  The total area is 53.3 square kilometres (20.6 & nbsp;sq & nbsp;mi). The largest island is ''[[Main Island]]'', sometimes itself called ''Bermuda''. 
 
 ==Climate== 
 Bermuda has a subtropical [[climate]]. < ref > Forbes, Keith.  " Bermuda Climate and Weather " .   The Royal Gazette, 2008, webpage: 
    [http://www.bermuda-online.org/climateweather.htm B-clim]. < /ref >  The weather is [[humid]] and, as a result, the [[summer]]time heat index can be high, even though mid-August [[temperature]]s rarely exceed {{nowrap|30 °C}} {{nowrap|(86 °F).}} Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around {{nowrap|20 °C (68 °F).}} The temperature rarely drops below 10 & nbsp;°C {{nowrap|(50 °F).}} 
 
 Bermuda is very likely to be affected by [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]].  The island's small size means that direct [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 3]] [[Hurricane Fabian]] on 5 September 2003. 
 
 The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall.  It is collected on roofs and catchments and stored in tanks. Each home usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation. 
 
 == Flora and fauna == 
 When discovered, Bermuda had no people.  It was mostly covered by forests of [[Juniperus bermudiana|Bermuda cedar]], with [[mangrove]] [[marsh]]es along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1000 [[vascular plant]] [[species]] are considered [[indigenous (ecology)|native]]. Of those 15, including the cedar, are [[endemism|endemic]]. 
 
 Many species of palm trees have been introduced to Bermuda.  [[Coconut palm]]s grow there, making it the furthest north place for the natural growth of this species.  While coconuts grow on Bermuda, the lack of heat does not usually let them properly set fruit. 
 
 The only [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] [[mammal]]s of Bermuda are five species of bats.  All of these bats are also in the eastern United States — ''[[Lasionycteris noctivagans]]'', ''[[Lasiurus borealis]]'', ''[[Lasiurus cinereus]]'', ''[[Lasiurus seminolus]]'' and ''[[Perimyotis subflavus]]''. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Grady, F.V. and Olson, S.L. |year=2006|title= Fossil bats from Quaternary deposits on Bermuda (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae)|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-mammalogy_2006-02_87_1/page/148 |journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume= 87|issue=1|pages=148–152|doi=10.1644/05-MAMM-A-179R1.1|s2cid=86831675}} < /ref >  Other commonly known [[fauna]] of Bermuda includes its national bird, the [[Bermuda Petrel]], and the [[Bermuda Rock Skink]]. The skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land [[vertebrate]] of Bermuda. It has recently been discovered, however, that a species of [[terrapin]] predated the arrival of humans on the archipelago. 
 
 == Parishes and municipalities == 
 [[File:Bermuda-divmap.png|thumb|left|200px|Parishes of Bermuda]] 
 
 Bermuda is divided into nine [[parish]]es and two [[municipality|municipalities]]. 
 
 Bermuda's nine parishes: 
 * [[Devonshire Parish, Bermuda|Devonshire]] 
 * [[Hamilton Parish, Bermuda|Hamilton]] 
 * [[Paget Parish, Bermuda|Paget]] 
 * [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke]] 
 * [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's]] 
 * [[Sandys Parish, Bermuda|Sandys]] 
 * [[Smith's Parish, Bermuda|Smith's]] 
 * [[Southampton Parish, Bermuda|Southampton]] 
 * [[Warwick Parish, Bermuda|Warwick]] 
 
 Bermuda's two municipalities: 
 * [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]] (city) 
 * [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] (town) 
 
 Bermuda's two informal villages: 
 * [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts Village]] 
 * [[Somerset, Bermuda|Somerset Village]] 
 
 Despite their names, Jones Village (in Warwick), Cashew City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke) and [[Tucker's Town]] (St. George's) are merely neighborhoods. Dandy Town and North Village are sports clubs and Harbour View Village is a small [[public housing]] development. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 Bermuda has a [[wealth]]y [[economy]], with [[finance]] as its largest sector, followed by [[tourism]]. < ref name=SM/ > < ref > " Bermuda's Tourism Industry " , Tayfun King, Fast Track,   [[BBC]] World News (3 Nov. 2009), webpage:   [http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_8330000 < !--   -- > /newsid_8339800/8339850.stm?bw=bb & ;mp=wm & ; < !--   -- > news=1 & ;nol_storyid=8339850 & ;bbcws=1  BBC50]. < /ref >  In 2005, Bermuda was even claimed to have the world's highest [[GDP]] [[person|per capita]], yet these [[statistics]] are hard to verify as Bermuda is not classified as a country but rather as a [[territory]] of the U.K. 
 [[File:Bermuda topographic map-en.png|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of '''Bermuda''', showing many of the islands (''right-click map to enlarge'').]] 
 
 == Main sights == 
 [[File:BDA Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|One of Bermuda's pink sand beaches, at Astwood Park]] 
 Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, [[cerulean]] blue ocean waters are popular with tourists. Many of Bermuda's hotels are  along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers can explore many [[shipwreck|wrecks]] and [[coral reefs]] in  shallow water (typically {{convert|30|-|40|ft}} in depth) with nearly unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are easy to access from shore by [[snorkeling|snorkellers]], especially at [[Church Bay, Bermuda|Church Bay]]. 
 
 Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is the Royal Naval Dockyard.  It includes the Bermuda Maritime Museum. Other attractions include the [[Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo]], < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.bamz.org 
  |title=Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo 
  |publisher=Bamz.org |access-date =20 June 2010}} < /ref >  Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with its impressive [[stalactite]]s and underground saltwater pools. 
 
 It is not possible to rent a car on the island.  However, visitors can hire motor [[scooters]] for use as private transport, or use public transport. 
 
 == Arts and culture == 
 Bermuda has produced, or been home to, actors such as [[Oona O'Neill]], [[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]], [[Diana Dill]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Will Kempe (actor)|Will Kempe]], and most famously, [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]. Other movie and television personalities who were born, or have lived, in Bermuda include producer [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], and cartoonist and [[Muppet]] man [[Michael Frith]]. 
 
 Music and dance are important in Bermuda. Noted musicians have included local icons [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], who performed for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and were on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s televised variety show.  Other musicians are jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]], singer-songwriter [[Heather Nova]] and her brother, [[Mishka]], [[tenor]] [[Gary Burgess]], classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]], and more recently, dancehall artist [[Collie Buddz]]. 
 
 In 1979, [[Gina Swainson]] was crowned  " [[Miss World]] " . 
 
 == Sports == 
 [[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] was in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is [[Dwayne Leverock]]. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]]. The yearly  " Cup Match "  cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the time for a popular national holiday. 
 
 In 2007 Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. The event returned to Bermuda again in 2008 and 2009. Bermudian Quinn Talbot was once the World one-armed golf champion. 
 
 The Government said in 2006 that it will provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and [[Bermuda national football team|football]] teams. Bermuda's most famous footballers include [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Ralph Bean (footballer)|Ralph Bean]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team. The team plays in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]]. 
 
 [[Sailing]], [[fishing]], and [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The [[Bermuda Race|Newport–Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition.  A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also started in Bermuda. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |access-date =20 June 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's [[Katura Horton-Perinchief]] made history by becoming the first black female diver in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, [[Clarence Hill (boxer)|Clarence Hill]],. Hill won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also was in Men's [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. [[Jillian Teceira]] was in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Bermuda also competes in the biennial [[Island Games]].  It will host in 2013. 
 
 Bermuda has a proud [[Rugby Union]] community. The Bermuda Rugby Union team won the 2011 Caribbean championships – defeating [[Guyana]] in the final. 
 
 ==Bermuda Triangle== 
 Bermuda is the easternmost point of the so-called  " [[Bermuda Triangle]] " – a region of sea in which a number of [[aircraft]] and [[ship]]s have allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Some people think there is a [[pattern]] to the disappearances, while other people think it is only [[coincidence]].
