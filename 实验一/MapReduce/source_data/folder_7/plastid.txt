 A '''plastid''' is a self-reproducing [[organelle]] of [[plant]]s and [[algae]]. A '''plastome''' is the [[DNA]] [[genome]] of a plastid. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p341 < /sup >  They are like tiny [[machines]] inside [[cells]]: each makes or stores important chemicals used by the plant.  
 
 Examples of plastids are:  
 * [[Chloroplasts]]: photosynthesis; other plastids may have developed from chloroplasts. Etioplasts are chloroplasts which have not been exposed to light. 
 * Chromoplasts: [[pigment]] synthesis and storage.  
 * Leucoplasts: colourless, make terpenes such as [[resin]]. Sometimes they develop into more specialized types of plastid: 
 ** Amyloplasts: [[starch]] storage 
 ** Elaioplasts: [[fat]] storage. 
 ** Proteinoplasts: store  &  modify [[protein]]. 
 *** Statoliths: detect [[gravity]]. 
 
 ==Plastids in algae== 
 Plastids in [[algae]] and [[hornwort]]s  may differ from plant plastids. In algae, the term  " leucoplast "  is used for all unpigmented plastids and their function differs from the leucoplasts of plants.  
 
 [[Glaucocystophyte|Glaucocystophytic]] algae contain muroplasts, which are similar to chloroplasts except that they have a [[cell wall]], similar to that of [[prokaryote]]s. [[Rhodophyte|Rhodophytic]] algae contain rhodoplasts, which are red chloroplasts which allow the algae to [[photosynthesis]]e to a depth of up to 268 metres. < ref name=wise > Wise, Robert R. 2006.

 == Genetics and evolution == 
 Plastids are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell. In [[endosymbiont theory]], plastids originated as [[cyanobacteria]]. This was first suggested by Mereschkowsky in 1905. < ref > {{cite journal | author= Mereschkowsky C. 1905 | title= Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche | journal= Biol Centralbl | volume=25 | pages=593–604}} < /ref > < ref > Khakhina L.N. 1992. ''Concepts of symbiogenesis: a historical and critical survey of the research of Russian botanists''. Yale, New Haven CN. < /ref >  Schimper in 1883 had said chloroplasts closely resembled cyanobacteria. < ref > {{cite journal | author= Schimper A.F.W. 1883 | title= Über die Entwicklung der Chlorophyllkörner und Farbkörper | journal= Bot. Zeitung  | volume=41 | pages=105–14, 121–31, 137–46, 153–62}} < /ref >   
 
 Almost all chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] event. < ref > {{cite journal | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Keeling, Patrick J. 2004  | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | issue = 10 | pages = 1481–1493 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1481| pmid = 21652304 | s2cid = 17522125 }} < /ref >  [[Mitochondria]] also derive from [[symbiosis]], but chloroplasts are found only in [[plant]]s and [[protist]]a. The chloroplast is surrounded by a double-layered composite membrane with an intermembrane space; further, it has reticulations, or many infoldings, filling the inner spaces. The chloroplast has its own [[DNA]], which codes for [[redox]] proteins involved in [[electron]] transport in photosynthesis. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Krause K. 2008 |title=From chloroplasts to  " cryptic "  plastids: evolution of plastid genomes in parasitic plants |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_current-genetics_2008-09_54_3/page/111 |journal=Curr.
