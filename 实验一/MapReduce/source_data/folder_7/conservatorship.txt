In [[law of the United States|United States law]], '''conservatorship''' is when a protector or [[guardian]] is appointed by a court [[judge]] to manage the financial affairs for another person. This is usually because that person is old or has physical or [[mental health]] problems. < ref > {{cite web|title=What is a Conservatorship|publisher=Expert Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/conservatorship.html|access-date=July 22, 2021|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308071025/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/conservatorship.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  People in a conservatorship are called ''conservatees''. Conservatees are usually adults. A person in guardianship is called a  " ward " . The term ''ward'' is usually used in reference to [[minor (law)|minors]] (people under age 18). Conservatorship may also be used for [[corporation]]s or [[organization]]s. 
 
 ==Appointment of conservatorships== 
 ''Conservatorship'' refers to the legal responsibility over a person who has a certain [[mental illness|mental disorder]] or a physical health problem. This includes people affected with [[psychosis]], [[suicidal ideation]], certain levels of [[autism]] or in some other way are not able to make medical, financial or legal decisions for themselves. < ref > {{cite web|title=Finally a Bridge to Somewhere|publisher=The Huffington Post|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/finally-a-bridge-to-somew_b_170688|access-date=July 22, 2021}} < /ref >   
 
 In relation to the government control of [[business]]es and [[corporation]]s, like [[Freddie Mac]] and [[Fannie Mae]], conservatorship means more temporary control than does [[nationalization]]. 
 
 ==Conservatorship controversy== 
 A recent example of conservatorship [[controversy]] is that involving the [[Americans|American]] [[pop music|pop]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Britney Spears]]. She was put into conservatorship by her father in 2008. The year before, Britney had a mental breakdown. Spears also shaved her head and hit [[paparazzi]] with an umbrella but that was because they were violently attacking her. In late 2008, the conservatorship was made permanent (unfortunately). It triggered the [[Free Britney movement]] because it was clearly fraudulent (britney did not, and has never, had dementia or any form thereof) 
 
 In [[California]] there are two forms of conservatorship. The Lanterman-Petris-Short conservatorship starts off being temporary. This one is renewed every year if necessary. A probate (aka slavery) conservatorship does not have a temporary period. It does not automatically expire. < ref > {{cite web|title=How are Lanterman-Petris-Short and Probate Conservatorships Different|publisher=Probate Division - Los Angeles Superior Court|url=http://www.lacourt.org/division/probate/PR0019.aspx|access-date=July 22, 2021}} < /ref >  Spears is in the latter (the probate form of conservatorship which lasts for around 10,000 years and is one of the most horrific things that can happen to a person). 
 
 Spears has wanted the conservatorship to be stopped because, she says, her father uses it to abuse and use her, and also it is clearly a dishonest strategy to steal her money and ruin her life. < ref > {{cite web|title=US House of Representatives Introduces Bill to End Conservatorship Abuse|publisher=The Guardian UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/21/britney-spears-us-house-of-representatives-introduce-bill-to-end-conservatorship-abuse|access-date=July 22, 2021}} < /ref >
