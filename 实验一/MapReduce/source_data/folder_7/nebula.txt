 == Origin == 
 A nebula is usually made up of [[hydrogen]] [[gas]] and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. It may be the first stage of a [[Star|star's]] cycle, but it may also be one of the last stages. 
 
 Many nebulae or stars form from the [[gravitation]]al collapse of gas in the [[interstellar medium]] or ISM. As the material contracts, massive stars may form in the center, and their [[ultraviolet radiation]] [[ion]]ises the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical [[wavelength]]s. 
 
 The size of these nebulae, known as [[H II region]]s, varies depending on the size of the original cloud of gas.  These are sites where star formation occurs.  The formed stars are sometimes known as a young, loose cluster. 
 
 Some nebulae are formed as the result of [[supernova]] explosions, the death throes of massive, short-lived stars.  The materials thrown off from the [[supernova]] explosion are ionized by the energy and the compact object that it can produce.  One of the best examples of this is the [[Crab nebula]], in [[Taurus]].  The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labelled [[SN 1054]].  The compact object that was created after the explosion lies in the center of the Crab Nebula and is a [[neutron star]]. 
 
 Other nebulae may form as [[planetary nebula]]e. This is the final stage of a low-mass star's life, like [[Earth]]'s [[Sun]]. [[Star]]s with a [[mass]] up to 8-10 solar masses evolve into [[red giant]]s and slowly lose their outer layers during pulsations in their atmospheres.  When a star has lost enough material, its temperature increases and the [[ultraviolet radiation]] it emits can [[ion]]ize the surrounding nebula that it has thrown off.  The nebula is 97% [[Hydrogen]] and 3% [[Helium]] with trace materials. 
 
 In the past [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[star cluster]]s were also called 'nebulae', but no longer. Nebulae can be sorted by what they look like and why we can see them. 
 
 == Star-forming regions and diffuse nebulae == 
 [[File:Rho Ophiuchi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The dark nebula [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]]]] 
 
 Large regions of ionised hydrogen gas are produced by star-forming regions. Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the [[Orion complex]]. In these regions gravitation pulls together gas and dust. Material clumps together to form larger masses, which attract further matter. Eventually this become massive enough to form [[star]]s. The material left over may form [[planet]]s and other [[planetary system]] objects.

 === Emission nebulae / H II regions === 
 [[Emission nebula]]e make their own light. They are often called [[H II region]]s, because it is the ionized hydrogen which makes them glow. Usually the gases in an emission nebula are [[ionization|ionized]]. This makes them emit light and [[infra-red]] radiation. 
 
 === Reflection nebulae === 
 [[Reflection nebula]]e [[reflection|reflect]] light from nearby stars. 
 
 === Dark nebulae === 
 [[Dark nebulae]] do not emit light or reflect light.  They block the light from stars that are far away. 
 
 == Planetary nebulae == 
 [[Planetary nebula]]e are quite common, because they are produced by [[red giant]] stars late in their lives. These stars usually become [[white dwarf]]s, leaving behind an expanding ball of ionized gas, which we see as a roughly circular bright nebula. 
 
 == Supernova remnants == 
 A [[supernova]] occurs when a high-mass star reaches the end of its life.  When [[nuclear fusion]] in the core of the star stops, the star collapses and explodes . < ref name= " shu1982 " > Shu F.H. 1982. ''The physical universe''. Mill Valley, California: University Science Books. {{ISBN|0-935702-05-9}} < /ref >   The expanding shell of gas forms a [[supernova]] remnant. The [[Crab nebula]] is a supernova remnant which probably exploded in 1054 AD. Light and [[X-ray]] emission from supernova remnants comes from ionized gas. There is a huge amount of [[radio]] emission called [[synchrotron emission]]. < ref name= " shu1982 " / >  This emission originates from high-velocity [[electrons]] [[oscillation|oscillating]] in [[magnetic field]]s.
