 '''Manticores''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''martikhoras'', meaning [[man]]-eater) were creatures in [[Greek mythology]]. They had the body of a lion, a human head, and three rows of [[teeth]] similar to [[shark]]s. Although it changes from story to story, they also often had the tail of a dragon or a scorpion. Sometimes they could shoot poisonous [[spine]]s from their tails. When early Greeks noticed that someone had gone missing, some said this as proof that manticores were real.
