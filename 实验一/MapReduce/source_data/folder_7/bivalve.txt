 The '''bivalves''' are a large class of [[mollusc]]s, also known as '''pelecypods'''. 
 
 They have a hard [[calcareous]] [[Animal shell|shell]] made of two parts or 'valves'. The soft parts are inside the shell. The shell is usually [[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetrical]]. 
 
 There are over 30,000 [[species]] of bivalves, including the [[fossil]] species. There are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 [[genera]] and 106 [[Family (biology)|families]]. All of them live in the water, most of them in the [[sea]] or in [[brackish water]]. Some live in [[fresh water]]. All are [[filter feeder]]s: they lost their [[radula]] in the course of evolution. A few are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny micro[[algae]] eaten by other bivalves. 
 
 The best known examples of bivalves are [[clam]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[scallop]]s and [[oyster]]s. < ref name=Pond > Ponder W.F.  &  Lindberg David R. 2008. ''Phylogeny and evolution of the Mollusca''. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0520-25092-3}} < /ref > 
 
 == Shell == 
 Bivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge with [[hinge teeth]]. They are made of a [[calcareous]] [[mineral]], [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]]. The valves are covered by a [[periostracum]], which is an [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[Horn (anatomy)|horny]] substance. This forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell. 
 
 The shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles. [[Scallop]]s can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://paleo.cortland.edu/tutorial/Bivalves/bivalvia.htm |title= " The shell of bivalve molluscs "  in |access-date=2011-03-03 |archive-date=2010-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228055808/http://paleo.cortland.edu/tutorial/Bivalves/bivalvia.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Food == 
 A bivalve takes in water that has [[plankton]] and other things floating in it. 
 
 Some (but not all) molluscs have a part of their [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] known as the [[siphon]] (a tube). Siphons, if they exist, come in pairs, one to suck in, one to expel. 
 
 Anything that is small enough to fit inside the hole of its incurrent siphon enters the bivalve. When the floating material comes in, it gets stuck in slimy mucus that is on the surface of the bivalve's gills. The food is moved down to the mouth, which is on the other side of the siphon. Food is digested in the bivalve's [[stomach]] and intestine, and everything that is not digested goes out through the other siphon, with water. 
 
 The siphons are an [[adaptation]] of [[burrow]]ing molluscs. Those that live above the [[substrate]] ([[sediment]]), such as scallops and oysters, do not need them. 
 
 === Feeding types === 
 There are four feeding types, defined by their gill structure:  
 *'''Protobranchs''' use their [[ctenidia]] solely for respiration, and the [[labial palp]]s to feed 
 *'''Septibranchs''' possess a [[septum]] across the mantle cavity which pumps in food. 
 *'''Filibranchs''' and '''lamellibranchs''' trap food with a [[mucus|mucous]] coating on the ctenidia; the filibranchs and lamellibranchs are differentiated by the way the ctenidia are joined 
 
 == Movement == 
 === Digging === 
 As a group, the bivalves are adapted to penetrate into, and to move along [[horizontal]]ly along, soft ground such as [[mud]] and [[sand]]. Common examples of this are [[razor shell]]s, which can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape enemies, and [[cockle]]s. 
 
 === Swimming === 
 [[Scallop]]s and [[file clam]]s can swim to escape a [[predator]], clapping their valves together to create a jet of water. Cockles can use their foot to leap from danger. However these methods quickly exhaust the animal. In the razor shells the siphons can break off only to grow back later. 
 
 == Defensive secretions == 
 The file shells can produce a noxious secretion when threatened, and the fan shells of the same family have a unique, acid-producing organ. 
 
 ==Comparison with brachiopods== 
 Bivalves are superficially similar to [[brachiopod]]s, but the construction of the shell is completely different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, they are on the left and right sides. 
 
 Bivalves appeared late in the [[Cambrian explosion]] and came to increase in the [[Palaeozoic]], and dominate over [[brachiopod]]s during the [[Mesozoic]]. So, it was thought that bivalves are better adapted to aquatic life than the brachiopods, and this caused brachiopods to be [[Competition|out-competed]] and relegated to minor [[ecological niche|niche]]s. 
 
 However, after the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] bivalves had a huge [[adaptive radiation]] while brachiopods were devastated, losing 95% of their diversity.

 The upshot was that bivalves took over the desirable [[inshore]] [[habitat]]s. Brachiopods now live in deeper waters where food is scarcer.
