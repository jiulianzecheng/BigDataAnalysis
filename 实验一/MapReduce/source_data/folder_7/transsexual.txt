 '''Transsexual''' people are people who change their appearance to more closely resemble that of the opposite [[sex]]. Transsexuals may be [[male]] or [[female]]. They typically take hormones and often undergo surgeries to support this process. They usually adopt a new name and may legally have their name changed.  
 
 People who go from male to female (MTF) are referred to as transsexual women. People who go from female to male (FTM) are referred to as transsexual men. 
 
 == Ways to go from male to female == 
 Transsexual women take female [[hormones]]. They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called [[androgen]]s. Taking estrogen pills makes [[breasts]] grow. It does not make [[beard]]s go away. It does not make [[voice]]s higher. Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back. This takes a long time and hurts. Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices. Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery. Some transsexual women also get surgery on their [[genitals]]. This is called a [[vaginoplasty]]. This is done by making a [[vagina]] from the [[skin]] of their [[penis]], which is turned inside out.  Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine. Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger. 
 
 == Ways to go from female to male == 
 Transsexual men take male [[hormones]]. This will make their voices lower. It will make a beard grow. It can also stop their [[menstruation]]. Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones.  
 
 Some transsexual men have surgery. One surgery is removal of breasts ([[mastectomy]]). Some transsexual men also get surgery on their [[genitals]]. One surgery is removal of the [[uterus]] and [[ovaries]] ([[hysterectomy]]). Some may also get surgery on their outside [[genitals]]. One way takes their [[skin]] and [[tissue (biological)|tissue]] and makes it into a penis ([[phalloplasty]]). Another way takes the [[clitoris]] (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is ([[metoidioplasty]]). The place where [[urine]] comes out ([[urethra]]) can be run through the new penis. The phalloplasty looks more like a penis. A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long. Some ways also make a [[scrotum]] from the [[labia]]. They may also have the [[vagina]] taken out or closed.
