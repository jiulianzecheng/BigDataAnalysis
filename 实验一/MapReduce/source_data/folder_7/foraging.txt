'''Foraging''' is the act of [[hunting]] or gathering food. For example, [[cattle]] forage [[grass]] to eat. The idea of animals foraging is called ''forage theory'', and was first proposed in 1966. < ref name=Emlen1966 > {{citation |year=1966 |author=Emlen J.

 Humans that forage are often called [[hunter-gatherer]]s, who find and eat ([[wikt:wild|wild]]) animals and plants without [[domestication]] of them (people who [[farm]] plants are not hunter-gatherers, as they have grown them themselves).
