 A '''quill pen''' is a [[tool]] used for [[writing]], made from a [[flight feather]] of a large [[bird]]. Quills were used for writing with [[ink]] before other [[pen]]s were invented. They are still used in [[calligraphy]] sometimes. Today, most paper is made from [[wood plulp]]. Such papers use the quill rather rapidly.  The hollow shaft of the feather (the ''calamus'') acts as an ink reservoir and ink flows to the tip by [[capillary action]].
