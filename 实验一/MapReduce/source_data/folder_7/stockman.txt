 In [[Australia]], a '''stockman''' is the name given to a person who looks after the [[livestock]] on large farms known as a [[station]]. Stations are owned by a {{broken wikt link|grazier|grazier}} or a grazing company. A stockman can also be the persons employed at [[abattoir]]s, [[feedlot]]s, on live export ships or with stock and station agencies. 
 
 People who work on station, including stockmen, are also known as “station hands”. Men learning how to become station managers are known as  " jackaroos " , while women are known as  " jillaroos " . Girls are often stockmen on farms. Some stations are now making it easier for women to work on stations by building female living quarters and putting in machinery to do some of the heavy work. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.campdraft.com.au/pdfs/ACAApril2008RuleBook.pdf |title=Campdraft Rules |access-date=2009-03-13 |archive-date=2009-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318021333/http://www.campdraft.com.au/pdfs/ACAApril2008RuleBook.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 A related job is that of the [[Drover (Australian)|drover]], who, like the [[shearer]] may be an temporary seasonal worker. Drovers are employed in looking after the livestock while they are travelling on a [[stock route]].  
 
 The word ''stockman'' was used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as meaning a person who raised livestock, mainly cattle. The word ''[[stockgrower]]'' is used now. This meaning is very different from the Australian use of the word ''stockman''.
