 '''Ullswater''' is the second largest [[lake]] in the [[Lake District|English Lake District]]. It is about nine miles (14.5 kilometres) long and 0.75 miles (1,200 m), wide with a maximum depth of slightly more than {{convert|60|m|ft|0}}. 
 
 Many regard Ullswater as the most beautiful of the English lakes, < ref name= " test1 " > [http://www.ullswater.visitor-centre.co.uk/ www.ullswater.visitor-centre.co.uk.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001030250/http://www.ullswater.visitor-centre.co.uk/ |date=2007-10-01 }} Calls Ullswater  " England's most beautiful lake and so much more " . < /ref >  it has been compared to [[Lake Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]].  
 
 It is a typical Lake District narrow  " [[ribbon lake]] "  formed after the last [[ice age]] when a [[glacier]] scooped out the valley floor. When the glacier retreated, the deepened section became a lake.Three separate glaciers formed the lake. The surrounding mountains give Ullswater the shape of a stretched 'Z' with three distinct segments (or 'reaches') that wend their way through the surrounding hills. 
 
 For much of its length Ullswater forms the border between the ancient counties of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]]. 
 
 The village of [[Glenridding]], at the southern end of the lake, is popular with tourists of all kinds. For mountain walkers, England's third highest mountain, [[Helvellyn]] and other challenging peaks are near the lake. The village has ample accommodation including two [[Hostel|Youth Hostels]] and camp sites. The village of [[Pooley Bridge]] is at the northern end of the lake. Its narrow 16th-century bridge straddles the [[River Eamont]] as it flows out of Ullswater; it is overlooked by [[Dunmallard Hill]], which was the site of an [[Iron Age]] fort. On the western side of the lake is Aira force [[waterfall]]. Near there the Brackenrigg Inn overlooks sweeping views of the dramatic landscape.
