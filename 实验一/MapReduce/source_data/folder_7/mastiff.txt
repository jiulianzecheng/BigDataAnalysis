 The '''Mastiff''', also called the '''English Mastiff''', is a large [[breed]] of [[dog]]. < ref name=AKC > {{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/mastiff/detail/ |title=Meet the Mastiff |author= |date= |website= |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=25 February 2016}} < /ref >  They have a [[Rectangle|rectangular]] body, thick [[muscle]]s and a massive [[head]] with a wrinkled [[forehead]]. < ref name=AKC/ >  They stand from {{convert|27.5|in|cm}} to {{convert|30|in|cm}} at the [[shoulder]] and typically weigh between {{convert|120|lb}} and {{convert|230|lb}}. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mastiff |title=Mastiff |author= |date= |website= |publisher=VetStreet |accessdate=25 February 2016}} < /ref >  The Mastiff is one of the largest breeds of dogs < ref > Vince Stead, ''New and Improved How to Raise and Train Your Mastiff Puppy Or Dog'' (Vince Stead, 2011), p. 7 < /ref >  who can outweigh many full-grown men. < ref name=AKC/ >  They can be gentle with family members but are also excellent [[guard dog]]s. < ref name=Case21.22 > Linda P.

 == History == 
 The early Mastiff was called a '''molosser''' or molossus. < ref name=Thornton5.6 > Kim Thornton, ''Mastiffs: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Grooming, Behavior and Training'' (Hauppauge, NY: Barron's; Enfield: Publishers Group UK, 2009), pp. 5–6 < /ref >  [[Genetics]] and breeding dogs to get certain [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s was unknown then. In 350 [[BC]], [[Aristotle]] wrote that the [[ancestor]] of the Mastiff was the Molosser. < ref name=Thornton5.6/ >  These were the [[Dogs in warfare|war dogs]] and [[guard dog]]s kept by the [[Molossoi]] people, an ancient [[Greece|Greek]] [[tribe]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.bulldoginformation.com/molossers-mastiff-breeds-history.html |title=History and Origin of the Molosser Breeds |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Bulldog Information Library |accessdate=26 February 2016}} < /ref >  Today the two names are often used to mean the same [[wikt:group|group]] or family of dogs. For [[example]], the modern [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] is sometimes described as a mastiff and sometimes as a molosser [[wikt:type|type]]. < ref name=Case21.22/ > 
 
 == Mastiff or Molosser breeds == 
 While the Mastiff is a recognized breed, there are also a number of [[working dog]] varieties that are closely [[wikt:relate|relate]]d to the Mastiff. < ref name=PH > {{cite web |url=https://pethelpful.com/dogs/Mastiff-Breeds |title=Breaking Down the Mastiff Breeds |author= |date=15 October 2015 |website= |publisher=PetHelpful |accessdate=25 February 2016}} < /ref >  Many prefer to class them as molosser breeds so as not to confuse them with the Mastiff dog breed. < ref name=BDIM > {{cite web |url=http://www.bulldoginformation.com/molossers-mastiff-type-dogs.html |title=Molosser Breeds (Molosser Dogs, Molossers, Mastiff Breeds, Molossoid Breeds, Molossian, Molossi) |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Dog Breeds of the World |accessdate=25 February 2016}} < /ref >  Currently there are about 14 different breeds in the molosser/mastiff family of dogs that are bred from or have a common ancestor with the Mastiff. < ref name=PH/ >  These include the:

 == Training and temperament == 
 When training a Mastiff, it is important to recognize they have a certain [[wikt:personality|personality]] type that needs additional time and [[wikt:patience|patience]] to learn things. < ref name=MW > {{cite web |url=http://www.mastiffweb.com/training.htm |title=Training your Mastiff |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Mastiffweb |accessdate=26 February 2016 |archive-date=9 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209162530/http://mastiffweb.com/training.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  A Mastiff is a very [[wikt:relax|relax]]ed dog and takes his or her time in doing a task. [[Ownership|Owners]] call this the  " Mastiff tempo " . < ref name=MW/ >  A Mastiff can't be trained the same as a [[Border Collie]]. < ref name=MW/ >  In [[temperament]], a modern Mastiff is a patient, sweet-tempered family [[wikt:guardian|guardian]] and [[Companion dog|companion]]. Gentle training works best. < ref name=AKC/ >  It is important to start that training early in [[puppy]]hood. < ref name=AKC/ >  They are a dog of tremendous size and strength and owning a Mastiff is a large [[wikt:responsibility|responsibility]]. 
 
 Mastiffs are very [[wikt:predict|predict]]able when they are facing a [[threat]] to their family. < ref name=faq2MCA > {{cite web |url=http://www.mcoamastiff.com/MASTIFFFAQ2.htm |title=Page Two of the Mastiff FAQ |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Mastiff Club of America |accessdate=26 February 2016 |archive-date=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306100137/http://www.mcoamastiff.com/MASTIFFFAQ2.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  If an owner and another person act in a threatening way, the Mastiff will usually get between them to protect its owner. < ref name=faq2MCA/ >  This is hard for the other person to miss and usually results in a cooling down of a heated discussion. But, if the situation does get worse, the Mastiff will usually [[wikt:growl|growl]] or snarl at the other person as a [[wikt:warn|warn]]ing. < ref name=faq2MCA/ >   
 
 Early [[wikt:socialisation|socialization]] is important so the Mastiff knows who belongs in the house and who does not. For [[example]], if a Mastiff puppy sees strangers coming and going all the time, they tend to see this as normal and might not recognize an [[wikt:intruder|intruder]] if they see one. < ref name=faq2MCA/ >  However, a properly trained and socialized Mastiff will usually corner a [[burglar]] or intruder. < ref name=faq2MCA/ >  Unless the intruder does something [[foolish]], like try to hurt the dog, he or she will probably not be hurt. < ref name=faq2MCA/ >
