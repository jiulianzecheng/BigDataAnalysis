'''Turbofolk''' or '''Pop-folk''' is a style of music from the [[Balkans]] that was invented in the early [[1990s]].  It mostly comes from [[Greece]], [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]], but it is also popular in other nearby countries.  It sounds like a mix of [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-style singing (in the [[Serbia]]n language) with [[electronic music]] and [[rock music]]. 
 
 Turbofolk is sometimes associated with the recent Balkan wars and the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]] but it is still popular.
