 ==Signs and symptoms== 
 It can take one to twelve days for a person to get sick after they get the chikungunya virus.  (This period of time is called the virus's [[incubation period]].)  Usually, people get sick in three to seven days. < ref name= " ThibervilleMoyen2013 " > {{cite journal|title=Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical syndrome, pathogenesis and therapy|journal=Antiviral Research|volume=99|issue=3|year=2013|pages=345–370|issn=0166-3542|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.06.009|pmid=23811281|pmc=7114207|last1=Thiberville|first1=Simon-Djamel|last2=Moyen|first2=Nanikaly|last3=Dupuis-Maguiraga|first3=Laurence|last4=Nougairede|first4=Antoine|last5=Gould|first5=Ernest A.|last6=Roques|first6=Pierre|last7=De Lamballerie|first7=Xavier}} < /ref >   Most people who get the virus (72% to 97%) get [[symptom]]s. < ref name= " ThibervilleMoyen2013 " / >    
 
 Chikungunya has an ''[[acute (medicine)|acute]] phase'', which lasts a short time, and a ''[[chronic]] phase'', which can last weeks, months, or years. < ref name= " BurtRolph2012 " > {{cite journal|title=Chikungunya: a re-emerging virus|journal=The Lancet|volume=379|issue=9816|year=2012|pages=662–671|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60281-X|pmid=22100854|s2cid=33440699|last1=Burt|first1=Felicity J.|last2=Rolph|first2=Micheal S.|last3=Rulli|first3=Nestor E.|last4=Mahalingam|first4=Suresh|last5=Heise|first5=Mark T.}} < /ref >    
 
 ===Acute phase=== 
 The acute phase usually begins with a sudden high [[fever]] that can last up to ten days.  The fever is usually above 39 & nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (102 & nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]]), and can sometimes get as high as 40 & nbsp;°C (104 & nbsp;°F). < ref name= " CampionWeaver2015 " / >   About half of people with chikungunya get a [[rash]], usually about two to five days after symptoms start. < ref name= " ThibervilleMoyen2013 " / >   Some people also have [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms, like [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], or [[diarrhea]]. < ref name=Powers/ > < ref name= " ThibervilleMoyen2013 " / > < ref > {{cite web|last=Powers|first=Ann|title=Chikungunya|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/chikungunya|publisher=United States [[Centers for Disease Control]] and Prevention|access-date=12 May 2014}} < /ref >   In rare cases, people may get [[conjunctivitis]] or other problems with their [[eye]]s. < ref > {{cite journal | title = Ocular manifestations associated with chikungunya | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_ophthalmology_2008-02_115_2/page/287 | journal = Ophthalmology | year = 2008 | volume = 115 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–91 | pmid = 17631967 | doi = 10.1016/j.ophtha.2007.03.085 | last1 = Mahendradas | first1 = Padmamalini | last2 = Ranganna | first2 = Shylaja K. | last3 = Shetty | first3 = Rohit | last4 = Balu | first4 = Ramgopal | last5 = Narayana | first5 = Kannan M. | last6 = Babu | first6 = Rajesh B. | last7 = Shetty | first7 = Bhujang K. }} < /ref > 
 
 The body starts to fight the virus after about a week by sending out [[immunoglobulin]] M (IgM), which [[antibody|attacks the virus]].  After this, most of the symptoms usually start to get better. < ref name= " ThibervilleMoyen2013 " / >   However, people often keep having some symptoms for about another week, like [[headache]], [[insomnia]] (trouble sleeping), and [[fatigue|exhaustion]]. < ref name=pmid18227590 > {{cite journal| title = Chikungunya fever: a re-emerging viral infection | journal = Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology | year = 2008 | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–12 | pmid = 18227590 | doi = 10.4103/0255-0857.38850 | last1 = Chhabra | first1 = M. | last2 = Mittal | first2 = V. | last3 = Bhattacharya | first3 = D. | last4 = Rana | first4 = UVS | last5 = Lal | first5 = S. }} < /ref >   After these symptoms end, the acute phase of chikungunya is usually over. 
 
 ===Chronic phase=== 
 In chikungunya's chronic phase, almost everyone with the virus (87% - 98%) gets very bad joint pain or [[wikt:stiffness|stiffness]].  This usually lasts for weeks or months.  However, it can last for years.  The joint pain can be so bad that a person cannot move the joints that hurt. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Dengue and other common causes of acute febrile illness in Asia: An active surveillance study in children.|journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|year=2013|volume=7|issue=7|pages=e2331|pmid=23936565|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002331|pmc=3723539|last1=Capeding|first1=Maria Rosario|last2=Chua|first2=Mary Noreen|last3=Hadinegoro|first3=Sri Rezeki|last4=Hussain|first4=Ismail I.

 Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell the difference between chikungunya and [[dengue fever]].  Both infections cause some of the same symptoms, like fever and very bad pain.  However, chikungunya usually does not cause [[bleeding]].  If a person [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] with chikungunya has bleeding problems, they may: < ref name= " CampionWeaver2015 " > {{cite journal |title=Chikungunya Virus and the Global Spread of a Mosquito-Borne Disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2015|volume=372|issue=13|pages=1231–1239|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1406035|pmid=25806915|last1=Weaver|first1=Scott C.|last2=Lecuit|first2=Marc}} < /ref >

 * Have both chikungunya and [[liver]] problems 
 
 ==Prevention== 
 [[Image:Mosquito Netting.jpg|thumb|{{Center|Low-cost [[mosquito net]] for a bed}}]] 
 The best way for people to protect themselves from chikungunya is to protect themselves from mosquitoes in places where the [[disease]] is common. < ref name=Cag2013 > {{cite journal| title = Chikungunya virus infection: an overview. | journal = The New Microbiologica | year = 2013 | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 211–27 | pmid = 23912863 | last1 = Caglioti | first1 = C. | last2 = Lalle | first2 = E. | last3 = Castilletti | first3 = C. | last4 = Carletti | first4 = F. | last5 = Capobianchi | first5 = M.

In places where chikungunya is common, [[government]]s can also do things to control the number of mosquitoes.  For example, they can spray [[pesticide]]s. 
 
 There is no [[vaccine]] for chikungunya. < ref name=nejm > {{cite journal| title = Chikungunya at the door--déjà vu all over again? | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | year = 2014 | volume = 371 | issue = 10 | pages = 885–7 | pmid = 25029435 | doi=10.1056/nejmp1408509| last1 = Morens | first1 = David M. | last2 = Fauci | first2 = Anthony S. }} < /ref >   [[Scientist]]s are doing [[experiment]]s to try to make a vaccine.

 There is no known treatment for chikungunya. < ref name=Cag2013 / >   No known [[anti-viral]] medicines (medicines which kill viruses) kill the chikungunya virus. < ref name= " ThibervilleMoyen2013 " / > 
 
 Medical professionals can only give  " supportive care. "   This means they can only treat chikungunya's symptoms.  For example, they may treat fever and joint pain with [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) like [[naproxen sodium|naproxen]]; [[analgesic|painkillers]] like [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen); and fluids. < ref name=Cag2013/ >   [[Aspirin]] is not given because it can make bleeding more likely to happen. < ref name= " factsheet " > {{cite web|url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/chikungunya_fever/basic_facts/pages/factsheet_health_professionals.aspx|title=Chikungunya—Fact sheet|access-date=17 December 2013|publisher=[[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]] (ECDC)|archive-date=19 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219030113/http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/chikungunya_fever/basic_facts/pages/factsheet_health_professionals.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Chronic joint pain=== 
 Scientists have not found any medication that helps everyone with chikungunya who has bad joint pain.  There is some [[evidence]] that certain medicines may help people who have bad joint pain for more than two weeks.  These medicines include: 
 * [[Ribavirin]], an anti-viral medicine < ref name=Cag2013/ > 
 * [[Chloroquine]], a medicine usually given to prevent [[malaria]] < ref name=Cag2013 / > 
 * [[Methotrexate]], a medicine used for [[rheumatoid arthritis]], which also causes very bad joint pain < ref name= " ParasharCherian2014 " > {{cite journal|title=Antiviral Perspectives for Chikungunya Virus|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2014|year=2014|pages=1–11|issn=2314-6133|doi=10.1155/2014/631642|pmid=24955364|pmc=4052087|doi-access=free|last1=Parashar|first1=Deepti|last2=Cherian|first2=Sarah}} < /ref > 
 
 These medicines do not help the symptoms of chikungunya during the acute phase. < ref name=Cag2013 / > < ref name= " ParasharCherian2014 " / > 
 
 ==[[Prognosis]]== 
 About 1 in 1000 people who get chikungunya die from the disease. < ref name=Mavalankar2008/ >   People older than 65, [[newborn]] babies, and people with other medical problems are most likely to have the most [[danger]]ous problems. < ref name= " Morrison2014 " > {{cite journal|last1=Morrison TE 2014|title=Reemergence of Chikungunya Virus|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-virology_2014-10_88_20/page/11644|journal=Journal of Virology|year=2014|volume=88|issue=20|pages=11644–11647|issn=0022-538X|doi=10.1128/JVI.01432-14|pmid=25078691|pmc=4178719|s2cid=24308414}} < /ref >   Chikungunya is especially dangerous for newborns because they can get the virus from their mothers during [[childbirth]], and because newborns' [[immune system]]s have to grow before they work as well as adults'. < ref name= " Morrison2014 " / >   This makes it much more difficult for newborns to fight off the virus.

 In the past, chikungunya existed mostly in [[developing country|developing countries]].  However, more recently, there have been [[epidemic]]s (where a very large number of people get the virus) in the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Pacific Islands]], and the Americas. < ref name= " PohSam2012 " > {{cite journal|title=Genotypic and Phenotypic Characterization of Chikungunya Virus of Different Genotypes from Malaysia|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e50476|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050476|pmid=23209750|pmc=3507689|doi-access=free|last1=Sam|first1=I-Ching|last2=Loong|first2=Shih-Keng|last3=Michael|first3=Jasmine Chandramathi|last4=Chua|first4=Chong-Long|last5=Wan Sulaiman|first5=Wan Yusoff|last6=Vythilingam|first6=Indra|last7=Chan|first7=Shie-Yien|last8=Chiam|first8=Chun-Wei|last9=Yeong|first9=Yze-Shiuan|last10=Abubakar|first10=Sazaly|last11=Chan|first11=Yoke-Fun}} < /ref > 
 
 When chikungunya was first discovered in 1952, it was uncommon and happened only in [[West Africa]].  People usually got the disease during [[rain]]y [[season]]s, because mosquitoes are more common during these times.  Beginning in the 1960s, there were sometimes outbreaks in Asia and Africa.  However, until 2005, chikungunya had been uncommon throughout the world. 
 
 Since 2005, chikungunya has become much more common.  It has caused large outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  For example, in [[India]], chikungunya re-appeared after 32 years where no Indian person had gotten the virus. < ref name=  " Lahariya2006 "  / >   Outbreaks have also happened in [[Europe]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[South America]], where chikungunya had never spread before.

 In 2005, there was a very large outbreak on [[Réunion]], an [[island]] in the Indian Ocean.  Out of about 770,000 people who lived on the island, about 266,000 (over 1 in every 3 people) got chikungunya. < ref name= " RothHoy2014 " > {{cite journal|title=Preparedness for Threat of Chikungunya in the Pacific|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2014|volume=20|issue=8|issn=1080-6040|doi=10.3201/eid2008.130696|pmid=25062306|pmc=4111160|last1=Roth|first1=Adam|last2=Hoy|first2=Damian|last3=Horwood|first3=Paul F.|last4=Ropa|first4=Berry|last5=Hancock|first5=Thane|last6=Guillaumot|first6=Laurent|last7=Rickart|first7=Keith|last8=Frison|first8=Pascal|last9=Pavlin|first9=Boris|last10=Souares|first10=Yvan}} < /ref >   In 2006, about 1.25 million people in India got the virus. < ref name =Muniaraj > {{cite journal |title=Fading chikungunya fever from India: beginning of the end of another episode? |journal=Indian Journal of Medical Research |year=2014 |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=468–70 |pmid=24820844 |pmc=4069744 |last1=Muniaraj |first1=M. }} < /ref >    
 
 Chikungunya was recently spread to the Americas.  From 2013-2014 in the Americas, 1,118,763 people have been thought to have the virus.

 Some scientists think that chikungunya has become much more common because of a change in the virus's [[genetic code]].  This change may have made it easier for the virus to make copies of itself in mosquito [[cell]]s. < ref name=PLoS > {{cite journal|title=Genome microevolution of chikungunya viruses causing the Indian Ocean outbreak |journal=PLOS Medicine |year=2006 |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e263 |pmid=16700631 |pmc=1463904 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030263 |display-authors=etal|last1=Schuffenecker |first1=Isabelle |last2=Iteman |first2=Isabelle |last3=Michault |first3=Alain |last4=Murri |first4=Séverine |last5=Frangeul |first5=Lionel |last6=Vaney |first6=Marie-Christine |last7=Lavenir |first7=Rachel |last8=Pardigon |first8=Nathalie |last9=Reynes |first9=Jean-Marc |last10=Pettinelli |first10=François |last11=Biscornet |first11=Leon |last12=Diancourt |first12=Laure |last13=Michel |first13=Stéphanie |last14=Duquerroy |first14=Stéphane |last15=Guigon |first15=Ghislaine |last16=Frenkiel |first16=Marie-Pascale |last17=Bréhin |first17=Anne-Claire |last18=Cubito |first18=Nadège |last19=Desprès |first19=Philippe |last20=Kunst |first20=Frank |last21=Rey |first21=Félix A. |last22=Zeller |first22=Hervé |last23=Brisse |first23=Sylvain }} < /ref >   It may have also allowed the virus to be spread more easily by the [[Asian tiger mosquito]] (''Aedes albopictus''). < ref > {{cite journal | title = A Single Mutation in Chikungunya Virus Affects Vector Specificity and Epidemic Potential | journal = PLOS Pathogens | year = 2007 | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e201 | pmid = 18069894 | pmc = 2134949 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030201 | last1 = Tsetsarkin | first1 = Konstantin A. | last2 = Vanlandingham | first2 = Dana L. | last3 = McGee | first3 = Charles E. | last4 = Higgs | first4 = Stephen }} < /ref >   This is important because the Asian tiger mosquito lives in many more places than ''Aedes aegypti'', the other species of mosquito that spreads chikungunya to humans.
