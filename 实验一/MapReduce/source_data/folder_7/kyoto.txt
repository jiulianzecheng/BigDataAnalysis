 '''Kyoto''' ({{lang-ja|京都}}) is a [[city]] in [[Japan]]. This city was the [[capital of Japan]] from [[794]] until [[1868]]. < ref > Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA585 & dq=  " Kyoto " ] in Japan Encyclopedia, pp. 585-587. < /ref > 
 
 Kyoto is a major city in the [[Kansai region]] of Japan. Its [[population]] is 1.5 million people. The city of Kyoto is the capital city of the [[Kyoto Prefecture|prefecture of Kyoto]]. Kyoto is one of the cultural, educational, and technology centers of Japan. In it are many universities including [[Kyoto University]], the second oldest national university of Japan. 
 
 ==History== 
 After 794, the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperor]]s lived in this city which was called [[Heian-kyō]]. < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA303 & dq=  " Heian-kyō " ] at pp. 303-304. < /ref > 
 
 In 1868, the city was called ''Saikyō'' ( " Western capital " ) in order to distinguish it from [[Edo]] (Tokyo) which was the  " Eastern capital " . < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA807 & dq=  " Saikyō " ] at p. 807. < /ref > 
 
 ==Geography== 
 There are mountains around the city on the east, north, and west sides. Some people in Kyoto believe that these mountains make Kyoto's summer especially hot and humid, and Kyoto's winter very cold. 
 
 We can see many [[temple]]s and [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] built in [[traditional]] Japanese [[architecture|architectural]] [[wikt:style|style]]s here. Some of those buildings are registered as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. On the other hand, since Kyoto was one of biggest and richest Japanese cities in the middle of the [[19th century]]; the [[citizen]]s were eager to import [[Europe]]an style, and there are many European style buildings in the center of Kyoto for company offices and schools. 
 
 Kyoto is one of oldest cities in Japan. Many tourists from all over the world come to Kyoto. Japanese people often come to Kyoto in the [[spring]] to see the [[cherry blossoms]], and in the [[autumn]] to see the leaves change color. 
 
 Traditional Kyoto food often uses vegetables. [[McDonald's]] signboards in Kyoto are brown to preserve the traditional surroundings. 
 
 The oldest novel in the world, Shikibu Murasaki's [[The Tale of Genji]] is set in Kyoto during the [[Heian Period]]. 
 
 Kyoto is famous for three festivals: [[Gion festival]], [[Aoi festival]] in the summer, and [[Jidai festival]] in the autumn.
