 '''Coalbrookdale''' is a village in the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] in [[Shropshire]], [[England]]. It is in an area of great significance in the history of [[industrialisation]]. This is where [[iron ore]] was first [[smelting|smelted]] by [[Abraham Darby]] using easily mined  " coking coal " . < ref > Thomas E. 1999. ''Coalbrookdale and the Darby family: the story of the world's first industrial dynasty''. York: Sessions/Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust. {{ISBN|1-85072-217-X}} < /ref > 
 
 The coal was drawn from drift [[Mining|mines]] in the sides of the valley. As it contained far fewer impurities than normal coal, the iron it produced was of a superior quality. Along with many other industrial developments that were going on in other parts of the country, this discovery was a major factor in the growing industrialisation of Britain. It was the [[Industrial Revolution]]. < ref > Trinder B. 2000. ''The industrial revolution in Shropshire''. 3rd ed, Chichester: Phillimore. {{ISBN|1-86077-133-5}} < /ref > 
 
 Today, Coalbrookdale is home to the [[Ironbridge Institute]], a partnership between the [[University of Birmingham]] and the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust]] offering postgraduate and professional courses in [[wikt:heritage|heritage]].
