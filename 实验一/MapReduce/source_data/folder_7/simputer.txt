 The '''Simputer''' is a small, cheap [[computer hardware|device]], similar to [[personal digital assistant]] (palmtop). The unique feature of this device is a [[smart-card]] [[interface]] which allows a single Simputer to be used by many [[user]]s. User's private [[Information|data]] might be kept on a cheap smart-card. This device was constructed by Indian company- Simputer Trust. The name stands for  " Simple computer " . 
 
 ==History== 
 
 The Simputer project was invented during the organization of the Global Village, an International Seminar on Information Technology for Developing Countries. It was conducted in October 1998. The discussion was about big need for a low-cost mass access device which will bring [[local-language]] IT to the masses. During inventing a name for new established original device, the purpose was to find complex [[acronym]] to fit the name Simputer. Thus Simputer is a Simple, Inexpensive, [[Multi-lingual]] comPUTER. Later it was expanded to Simple, Inexpensive Multi-lingual People's compUTER. Now it is also called  " [[computer]] for the masses " . 
 
 ==Features== 
 
 It is architecturally similar to the [[Linux Advanced Radio Terminal]] and the [[Intel]] [[StrongARM]] reference platform. It has [[processor]] Intel StrongARM 200+ [[MHz]], 64[[MB]] of [[RAM]], 32MB [[Flash ROM]] and may use cheap smart-cards with capacity 8[[KB]]. It has also [[USB]] connectivity and [[software]] [[modem]] so might be connect to the internet. 320x240 [[LCD]] interface in Simputer is with a [[touch panel]] [[overlay]] on [[liquid-crystal display]]. [[Operating system]] runs on a version of the [[Linux]] [[Kernel (computer science)]]. Type of the [[software]] used in Simputer is [[text-to-speech]]. This tool may use [[speaker]]s and [[microphone]] because it has special [[jack]]s. It has also built-in [[Infrared Data Association]] (IrDA) [[port]]. The device is powered by 3 [[AAA]] sized NiMH [[battery|batteries]]. 
 
 ==Licensees== 
 
 The Simputer Trust has licensed to [[manufacturer]]s to produce devices based on the Simputer. These companies are: PicoPeta Simputers and Encore Technologies. 
 
 ==Future prospects== 
 
 The [[tool]] developed is very generic and has similarities to many other countries. It is ideally suited for developing and under developed countries like: [[India]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mongolia]], [[Ghana]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bhutan]], [[Thailand]] or [[Vietnam]].
