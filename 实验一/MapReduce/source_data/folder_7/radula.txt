 The '''radula''' is the toothed [[chitin]]ous ribbon in the mouth  of most [[mollusc]]s. < ref > {{cite journal|author = Hickman Carole, S |title = Gastropod radulae and the sssessment of form in evolutionary paleontology|url = https://archive.org/details/sim_paleobiology_summer-1980_6_3/page/276 |journal = Paleobiology|volume = 6|issue= 3|year = 1980|pages = 276â€“294|doi = 10.1017/S0094837300006801| s2cid=89455588 }} < /ref >  It can be compared with the [[tongue]] of human beings but, unlike our tongue, it is used for cutting and chewing food before it enters the [[esophagus]].   
 
 The radula is present in all molluscs except [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], and only in molluscs.  For example, [[Gastropoda|Gastropods]] use it to graze and scrape [[diatom]]s and other microscopic [[alga]]e off rock surfaces and other substrata.  [[Squid]] use it for cutting up their prey.
