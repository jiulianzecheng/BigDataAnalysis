 '''Dragonflies''' are [[flying]] [[insect]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Odonata]]. There are about 5,300 [[species]] of dragonfly. The adults eat other flying insects. < ref name=Barnes/ > 
 
 Dragonflies have large [[compound eye]]s, which is their main [[Sensory system|sense]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]. They have four  strong [[transparent]] wings, and a long body. 
 
 Dragonflies are usually found around [[lake]]s, [[pond]]s, [[stream]]s and [[wetland]]s. They are [[predator]]s which eat [[mosquito]]es, and other small insects such as [[fly|flies]], [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s, and [[butterflies]]. Their [[larvae]], known as 'nymphs', are [[aquatic]]. < ref name=Barnes/ >  They are also carnivorous. 
 
 Because their legs are adapted to grab prey in the air, they are not adapted for moving on land. Once they perch, they rarely use their legs for walking.  
 
 Dragonflies have been around for 300 million years. < ref name=acrobats > {{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/Org/caer/ce/eek/critter/insect/dragonfly.htm|publisher=www.dnr.state.wi.us|title=Dragonflies, Wisconsin's aerial acrobats|accessdate=2008-07-22|archive-date=2008-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517110218/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/caer/ce/eek/critter/insect/dragonfly.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In the [[rain forests]] of the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, some species had wingspans of over {{convert|2|ft|cm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Oxygen levels were quite high at that time. 
 
 == Dragonflies and damselflies == 
 Dragonflies are in one suborder of the Odonata, and their relatives, the [[Damselfly|damselflies]], are in another suborder. Some people mistake the damselfly for the dragonfly, because they look similar. 
 
 Adult damselflies have thinner, more delicate bodies than those of dragonflies. This you can see even when they are flying. When at rest, most damselflies hold their wings together above the body. Most dragonflies hold their wings horizontally. The eyes of dragonflies are larger, and touch each other. < ref name=Barnes > Barnes, Robert D. 1982. ''Invertebrate Zoology''. Philadelphia, PA: Holt-Saunders. {{ISBN|0-03-056747-5}}. < /ref >  The eyes of damselflies are separated. Many damselflies live in groups close to a river. Taken together, these points are usually enough to distinguish the two groups. 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Female dragonflies lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in or near water, often on plants. When laying eggs, some species go under the water to lay their eggs on a good surface. The eggs then hatch into nymphs. While in the nymph stage they eat [[mosquito]] larvae and other things. 
 
 Most of a dragonfly's life is spent in the nymph form, beneath the water's surface. It is quite active. It can extend its jaws in front of its mouth to catch prey. Tiny [[vertebrate]]s such as tadpoles and fish are part of its [[diet]]. Some nymphs even hunt on land. < ref > {{cite book |last= Grzimeck |first= HC |author2= Bernard |title= Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia Vol 22 |publisher= Visible Ink Press |year=1975 |location= Detroit |page= 348 }} < /ref > < ref > [http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SO_JYKtl9A8/Rt-dP7_Z6oI/AAAAAAAABL0/Pe0EY9uxYSg/s320/dragonflyNymph.gif Head, mandibles, and unusual labium of dragonfly nymph (viewed from below)] < /ref > < ref > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StdLtePEuF0 Dragonfly Nymph Zoology] < /ref > < ref > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbUJVGsrFtk Dragonfly nymph eats guppy.] < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.luresext.edu/aquaculture/anaxattack7.gif |title=Dragon fly larvae labium extended to capture prey |access-date=2010-07-27 |archive-date=2012-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220005149/http://www.luresext.edu/aquaculture/anaxattack7.gif |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They draw water in and out of their [[rectum]].

Mill  &  R.S. Pickard|s2cid=45066664 }} < /ref >   They also have [[gills]] in their rectum. 
 
 === Larvae === 
 The larval stage of large dragonflies may last as long as five years. In smaller species, this stage may last between two months and three years. When the larva is ready to metamorphose into an adult, it climbs up a [[Reed (plant)|reed]] or other emergent plant. Exposure to air causes the larva to begin breathing. The skin splits at a weak spot behind the head and the adult dragonfly crawls out of its old larval skin, pumps up its wings, and flies off to feed on midges and flies. The adult stage of larger species of dragonfly can last as long as five or six months. 
 
 Dragonflies experience [[incomplete metamorphosis]]: the nymphs (called naiads) swim and live underwater, like fish. The female dragonfly lays her fertilized eggs near or right in the water. The naiads – which do not look much like dragonflies at all – hatch and immediately take to the water.  < br/ > 
 While living in the water, the naiads eat as many aquatic insects as possible, as well as other small creatures like tadpoles and minnows. Hidden among the plants, a naiad will lie in wait for prey to swim by. It can then squeeze water out of the rear of its [[abdomen]] like a jet stream. This moves the naiad forward very quickly, allowing it to snatch its prey with its powerful jaws. Some naiads even have a long lower jaw that can shoot out and grab prey. 
 
 Naiads live in the water for weeks (or even years in some species) and undergo a series of moults to grow. When a naiad is ready for its final moult, it finds a stick or other object sticking out of the water. It use this to crawl out of the water, and wait for its [[exoskeleton]] to dry. As the exoskeleton cracks open at the seam, the adult dragonfly crawls out. 
 
 == Adults == 
 === Eyesight === 
 [[File:Dragonfly eye 3811.jpg|thumb|right|120px|alt=See those deep, big clear eyes|Notice how this dragonfly's eyes wrap all the way over the top of its own head.]] 
 Dragonflies have tremendous eyesight. Their compound eyes are very large and have up to 50,000 individual lenses. Their eyes wrap around the top of the head. As a result, they have a wide field of vision: they can see almost everywhere at once. Sight is by far their most important [[sense]], used to catch flies and avoid birds. 
 
 === Flight === 
 In flight the adult dragonfly can move in six directions; upward, downward, forward, back, and side to side. < ref name=acrobats/ > < ref > {{cite book|last=Waldbauer|first=Gilbert|title=A walk around the pond: insects in and over the water|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2006|pages=[https://archive.org/details/walkaroundpondin00wald_859/page/n113 105]|isbn=9780674022119|url=https://archive.org/details/walkaroundpondin00wald_859}} < /ref >  They can also hover quite well in midair, and then they can take off at speeds of up to {{convert|35|mph|km/h|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Scientists discovered dragonflies can move each of their four wings independently which gives them their flying abilities. Dragonflies bend and twist their wings to cause little whirlwinds that move the air even faster over the upper part of the [[airfoil]], reducing air pressure even more than most flying animals can. This gives them a lot of lift, even in the face of powerful winds. 
 
 The flight style of different families  of dragonfly is one of their distinguishing features. It gives rise to some terms which are widely used by dragonfly observers: 
 
 '''Hawkers''' (family Aeshnidae). They are among the largest and  fastest flying dragonflies. The adults live mostly in the air, and even mate in flight. They have large and powerful wings, and can fly forwards or backwards or hover like a helicopter. The wings are always extended [[horizontal]]ly. 
 
 '''Skimmers''' or '''perchers''' are the very large family Libellulidae. There are several flight styles amongst its [[genera]]. The genus ''Sympetrum'' lives in the [[northern hemisphere]] and has 50 species. It breeds in ponds and searches over [[meadow]]s. There are at least 100 other genera. 
 
 '''Cruisers''' ([[Family (biology)|family]] Macromiidae). They usually fly over bodies of water (and roads) straight down the middle. They have green eyes which just barely meet at the top of the head. Females of this family lack an [[ovipositor]] at the end of the abdomen and lay their eggs by dipping the abdomen in the water as they fly over. 
 
 === Thermoregulation === 
 [[File:Halloween-pennant-obelisk.jpg|thumb|right|''Celithemis eponina'' in the obelisk posture.]] 
 
 Some dragonflies adjust their resting position to prevent overheating. They may use a [[handstand]]-like position to prevent overheating on sunny days. The [[abdomen]] is raised until its tip points at the sun, minimizing their surface area exposed to the heat. The position is called the '''obelisk posture'''. < ref > {{cite journal | last = May | first = Michael L. | title = Thermoregulation and adaptation to temperature in dragonflies (Odonata: Anisoptera) | journal = Ecological Monographs | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–32 | date = 1976 | doi = 10.2307/1942392 | jstor = 1942392 | url = http://jstor.org/stable/1942392 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |last= Corbet |first= Phillip S. |title= Dragonflies: behavior and ecology of Odonata |url= https://archive.org/details/dragonfliesbehav00corb |publisher= Cornell University Press |date= 1999 |location= Ithaca, NY |isbn= 0-8014-2592-1 |pages= 285–287 }} < /ref >  The [[species]] that do this are called 'perchers'; they are  " sit and wait "  predators which spend much of their time keeping still. 
 
 == Predation == 
 There are predators which eat dragonflies. The birds known a [[bee-eater]]s do regularly take dragonflies. Also, despite their good eyesight, dragonflies apparently cannot see spiders' webs, so they get caught there.
