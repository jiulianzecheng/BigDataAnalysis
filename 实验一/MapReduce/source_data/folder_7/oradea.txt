 == Quarters (parts of the city) == 
 [[File:Oradea Districts EN.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the 30 quarters]] 
 The city is made up of several areas. They are called quarters (''cartiere'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]):  
 * Centru Oradea (city centre) 
 * Vie 
 * Nufărul 
 * Rogerius 
 * Velenţa 
 * Cantemir 
 * Ioşia 
 
 === Vie === 
 The name ''Vie'' means [[vine]] in Romanian. It is the part of the city where the richest and most important people live. Vie is on the hills overlooking Oradea. Vie is popular with the elite (the powerful people) for two main reasons: it is close to Oradea, within walking distance of the [[railway station]] and the city centre; and it is peaceful and has fresh air. Vie has many mansions (big houses). In the north of Vie, at the top of the hills, there are also [[farm]]s that grow [[grape]]s for making [[wine]]. 
 
 Vie also has the County [[Hospital]] of Oradea (Spitalul Judetean), the [[tuberculosis]] hospital (Spital TBC), and the mental ([[mind]]) hospital. In [[communism|communist]] times, blocks of flats were built at the bottom of the hills. 
 
 The border between Vie and the city centre of Oradea is the railway station and railway tracks. Everything above the main railway station of Oradea is considered to be part of Vie. Despite its nearness to the railway station and Oradea, Vie is not easy to reach by [[public transport]] (except of course the part near the station), because many of its roads are unpaved (have a bad surface), and very steep. Some parts of the quarter are within walking distance of the railway station and the main [[supermarket]]s and [[shop]]s of Oradea, but others are more only easy to get to by car. There is a bus service that serves the three hospitals in the region, and the houses among them. 
 
 === Nufărul === 
 Like [[Rogerius]], Nufărul is like a mini-[[city]], with supermarkets, large blocks of flats and more. It is on the eastern outskirts (the edge) of Oradea, and is near to Băile Felix, the famous [[spa]] [[resort]]. It is possible to get to Nufărul by [[tram]] and [[bus]]. It is perhaps the fastest growing area, because of its position: many highways and national roads lead from Oradea to other Romanian cities and pass through Nuf & atilderul. For example, Nufărul was home to the second [[McDonalds]] (now there are many more) in Oradea, as well to many [[supermarket]]s that were not in central Oradea. Even though Nufărul has a lively market and excellent [[transport]], [[education]] and [[shopping]], it is not as nice as central Oradea, because it was planned and rebuilt in communist times. 
 
 The name Nufărul means [[water lily]] in Romanian. It has this name because there are many water lilies in the area. 
 
 === Rogerius === 
 Rogerius is located at the western end of the city, near Borş, on the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] border. It is the city's largest district other than the city centre, and is home to many communist-era housing estates, as well as a large [[market]]. You can get to Rogerius by [[tram]] from the city centre and other parts of Oradea, as well as by [[bus]]. It is also the first part of Oradea visitors will see when coming from Western [[Europe]] or [[Hungary]] through via Borş. The western part of Rogerius has factories from Communist times, including a chemical factory called ''Sinteza''. 
 
 === Iosia === 
 Unlike many of the other outer quarters of Oradea, Iosia does not have many large apartment blocks and is still fairly rural (like being in the country). It is located in the city's far southwest. The quarter is one of the most beautiful in Oradea, and has most of the facilities and amenities of the city. For tourists, it shows what Romanian country life is like while still being in the city close to all the excellent facilities that Oradea is home to. 
 
 == Transport (getting around) == 
 There is a [[public transport]] system run by ''Regia Autonomă Oradea Transport Local''. There are three [[tram]] lines and some [[bus]] routes. The city has three [[train station]]s: central, Vest and Est. Vest Station is in the quarter of Ioşia, and the central station (called simply Oradea) is in the city centre, near the quarter of Vie. 
 
 == Architecture (buildings) == 
 The city has many [[Baroque]] buildings. It was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] many times in [[history]]. 
 
 == Attractions == 
 [[File:Theater in Oradea-Nagyvárad.JPG|thumb|Building of the theater]] 
 The city centre is beautiful and worth visiting, as well as many other sites: 
 * Muzeul Ţării Crişurilor – a baroque [[museum]] famous for its windows. 
 * Catedrala barocă – the biggest baroque cathedral in Romania 
 * Cetatea Oradea – Oradea's [[Fortress]], in the shape of a [[pentagon]] 
 * Biserica cu Lună – a [[Church (building)|church]] with a [[clock]] which shows the phases of the [[moon]] 
 * Pasajul  " Vulturul Negru "  – the  " Black [[Eagle]] "  Passage 
 * Muzeul  " Ady Endre "  – the house of one of the best [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[poet]]s 
 * Teatrul de Stat – the State Theatre, designed by two [[Austria]]n architects who built around 100 [[theatre]]s and [[opera]] houses in Europe in the [[19th century]] 
 There are around 100 churches in Oradea, and three [[synagogue]]s ([[Judaism|Jewish]] places of worship). Only one of the synagogues is still being used. Oradea also has the biggest [[Baptist]] church in Eastern Europe
