'''Malocclusion''' is when the [[teeth]] in a person's upper [[jaw]] do not meet the teeth in the lower jaw correctly. 
 
 Edward Angle, the  " father of modern [[orthodontics]], "  was the first to use the word.  It is a [[portmanteau|combination word]] of ''occlusion'' and ''mal'' meaning  " bad. "
