 5,000 years ago, ancient [[Sumer]]ians made [[bowl]]s out of gold.  People have long used gold for making [[jewelry]] or sacred objects used in [[religion|religious]] worship.  
 In [[medieval]] Europe goldsmiths often acted as [[banker]]s. 
 
 Goldsmiths use methods such as [[soldering]], [[saw]]ing, [[forging]], [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], and [[polishing]] to make things out of gold. Goldsmiths traditionally teach their trade to [[apprentice]]s.  Today, jewelry arts schools teach goldsmithing and other similar skills.
