'''Freyja''' ([[Old Norse]]: “[the] Lady”) is the goddess of love, beauty, sex, fertility, seiðr, war, and death in [[Norse mythology]]. A member of the [[Vanir]], Freyja is the daughter of [[Njord|Njörðr]], and twin sister of [[Freyr]]. The most beautiful and refined of the goddesses, she owns the necklace Brísingamen, and rides in a chariot pulled by two cats, accompanied by a giant boar named [[Hildisvíni]]; in addition to this, Freyja possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. She is married to the god [[Óðr]], by whom she is the mother of the twin goddesses [[Hnöss]] and Gersemi. Freyja rules over the heavenly field(s) of [[Folkvang|Fólkvangr]], where she receives half of those that die in battle, as the other half go to [[Valhalla]]. The minor goddesses Gefjon, [[Skaði]], Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa ([[Old Norse]]: literally “Þorgerðr, Hǫlgi’s bride”), and Menglöð all serve as her handmaidens.  
 
 Her name is often translated into English as '''Freya''' when used nowadays, but the original Norwegian name is spelt ''Freyja.'' 
 
 ==Receiver of the slain== 
 The [[Valkyries]], having chosen who is to live and die in battle, collect the souls of those slain and bring them to [[Valhalla]], where they will feast and make revelry with [[Odin]]; Freyja herself shares half of these heroes with [[Odin]]. Her sacred realm is the field of [[Folkvang|Fólkvangr]], wherein lies her great hall [[Sessrumnir|Sessrúmnir]]. There, Freyja decides where her warriors shall sit. 
 
 This is what is written in the original myth: 
 
 ''The ninth hall is [[Folkvang]], where bright Freyja decides'' 
 
 ''Where her warriors shall sit,'' 
 
 ''Some of the slain belong to her,'' 
 
 ''Some belong to Odin.'' 
 
 ==Bride of the Odr== 
 Freyja married a god called [[Odr|Óðr]]. She loves her husband deeply, but he often went away on long journeys, and Freyja cried red golden [[tear]]s for him. Her tears become [[gold]] and [[amber]] when they fall to [[Earth]], therefore gold was called  " Freyja's tears " . They have two beautiful daughters called Hnoss and Gersemi. 
 
 ==Owner of Brisingamen== 
 Freyja often rides in a [[chariot]] pulled by big silver tabby [[cat]]s (her sacred animal) or on a golden boar named Hildisvíni, who accompanies her in battle. Freyja was renowned for her loveliness and beauty, as the myths tell of three giants who wanted to marry her, but they were all killed by [[Thor]], the god of thunder. 
 
 Freyja also has a precious necklace called Brísingamen. The god [[Loki]] once stole this necklace, and Freyja had to ask the guardian [[Heimdall]] for help. Heimdallr engaged Loki in combat and won against the Trickster, giving the necklace back to Freyja. For this, Loki is also called  " Thief of Brisingamen " , and Heimdall is also called  " Seeker of Brisingamen " .

 Thrymr, the king of the [[Jötnar|jǫtnar]], once stole Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir|Mjölnir]]. When Loki went to [[Jotunheim|Jötunheimr]] to retrieve the hammer, he found Thrymr, who revealed that he planned to give Mjölnir to Freyja as a wedding gift, as he requested her hand in marriage. When Loki returned to Asgard to deliver the news, Freyja was so angered that the heavens shook, and the necklace Brisingamen broke. When it was decided that [[Thor]] would go to Thrymr posing as Freyja (Loki disguised himself as one of the goddess' maidservants), he borrowed the necklace. Upon their arrival, Thrymr threw a huge feast in celebration of the marriage, as he presented Mjölnir to  " Freyja "  as a wedding gift; Thor then took his hammer, killing Thrymr and all who attended the wedding. 
 
 ==Jobs== 
 Freyja is a warrior goddess. Whenever she rides into battles, she gets half of the souls of dead heroes. She is also a practitioner of magic, otherwise known as seiðr, and is highly proficient in using it. She has a magical cloak made of falcon feathers which allows her to fly between different worlds. 
 
 Freyja is the patron goddess of [[crops]] and [[childbirth]]s. She is also a goddess of love, whom lovers may send prayers to. 
 
 Frigg and Freyja were two of the most revered goddesses in Norse mythology. They were especially worshipped by [[Viking]]s. Freyja is said to be the kindest among goddesses. In a poem in the [[Poetic Edda]], a young man called [[Ottar]] always trusted in the goddesses; he built a rock [[shrine]] for the goddesses, and Freyja answered his prayers. She disguised Ottar as her golden boar, and went on a trip to help him find his ancestors. 
 
 ==After Ragnarok== 
 In final battle of [[Ragnarok|Ragnarök]], Odin, and [[Freyr]] will die. Freyja is not stated as having died during Ragnarök or surviving. 
 
 ==Names== 
 Freyr's name means  " the Lord " , and Freyja's name means  " the Lady " . 
 
 The day of the week, [[Friday]], is named either after her, or after Odin's wife [[Frigg]].  Before Christianity became the dominant religion of the region, the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion constellation]] was called Frigg's [[distaff]] or Freyja's [[girdle]]. Frigg and Freyja may be one and the same goddess. 
 
 Freyja is also widely known as '''Vanadis''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: Vanadís -  " [[Lady]] of the [[Vanir]] " ). The metallic element [[Vanadium]] was named after her. The Vanir are close relatives of elves. Freyr is the Lord of the elves, and his sacred realm is Alfheim, home of the elves. 
 
 Another well-known name of Freyja is Gefn, which means  " Giver " , a suitable name for the [[fertility]] goddess. 
 
 Freyja represents the Norse women of the [[Viking]] Age, whose husbands often went away to war. From Freyja's name, noble [[Norse]] women were called Fru, and wives were called house-fru. Frau means  " woman "  in [[German language|German]]. 
 
 Freya and Freja are now common [[Scandinavian]] female names.
