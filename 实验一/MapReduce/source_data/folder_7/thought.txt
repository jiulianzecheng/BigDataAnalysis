'''Thought''' is the operation of the brain in [[conscious]] activity. It may or may not be goal-directed, aimed at solving specific problems. It is not the only way brains operate. Behaviour may occur as a result of [[instinct]], and the [[adaptive unconscious]] may solve problems without a person being aware. 
 
 Other animals can use their brains to solve problems, but there is no way of telling whether they do so consciously. Thought is investigated by four or five academic disciplines, each in its own way. The disciplines include [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[sociology]]. 
 
 == Philosophy == 
 [[Philosophy of mind]] is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the [[mind]], mental events, functions, properties, and [[consciousness]]. The mind-body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, especially the brain, is a central issue in philosophy of mind. < ref name =  " Kim1 " / > 
 
 === The mind-body problem === 
 The mind-body problem has to do with the explanation of the relationship that exists between [[mind]]s, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. < ref name= " Kim1 " > {{cite book| last = Kim J. 1995. ''Problems in the Philosophy of Mind''| editor = In Honderich, Ted| title =  Oxford Companion to Philosophy | year = 1995| url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond| publisher = Oxford University Press}} < /ref >  The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body. 
 
 Our perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulus|stimuli]] which arrive at our various [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a hat, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how someone's beliefs and desires can cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]]. < ref > Kim, Jaegwon 2009.
