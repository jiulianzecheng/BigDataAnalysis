 '''Conodonts''' are an [[extinct]] [[Class (biology)|class]] of the [[phylum]] [[Chordata]]. They are now regarded as [[vertebrate]]s, though the issue is still a live one. 
 
 For many years conodonts were known only from their feeding apparatus, which fossilises well. This is because most of the conodont animal was soft-bodied, so everything but the teeth were not fossilised in normal circumstances. 
 
 It was not until early 1980s that the conodont teeth were found with trace fossils of the host organism. < ref name= " Briggs-Lethaia " > {{cite journal|last=Briggs D.E.G; Clarkson E.N.K.  &  Aldridge R.J. 1983|year=1983|title=The conodont animal|journal=Lethaia|volume=16|issue=|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1983.tb01139.x}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1502-3931.1983.tb01993.x/abstract;jsessionid=405D1A58AD568895A907C0DB048F4030.d01t03] < /ref >  It came from the Lower [[Carboniferous]] [[lagerstätte]] near [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. 
 
 == Conodont elements == 
 The 'teeth', called '''conodont elements''', are very common in the fossil record, and have been used in bio[[stratigraphy]]. 
 
 They are also used as palaeo[[thermometer]]s. This is because under higher temperatures the [[phosphate]] undergoes colour changes, which are measured with the ''conodont alteration index''. This has made them useful for [[petroleum]] [[exploration]] in rocks dating from the [[Cambrian]] to the Upper [[Triassic]]. 
 
 == Description of the animal == 
 Eleven [[fossil]] imprints of conodont animals are known. They depict an [[eel]]-like creature with 15 or, more rarely, 19 elements forming a bilaterally symmetrical array in the head. This array was a feeding apparatus different from the jaws of modern animals.   
 
 There are three forms of teeth, ''coniform'' cones, ''ramiform'' bars, and ''pectiniform'' platforms, which may have performed different roles. 
 
 The organisms range from a centimeter or so to the giant ''Promissum'', 40 & nbsp;cm in length. < ref name=Gabbott1995 > {{cite journal|title=A giant conodont with preserved muscle tissue from the Upper Ordovician of South Africa|journal=Nature |last=Gabbott S.E; Aldridge R.J.  &  Theron J.N. 1995 |year=1995 |volume=374|issue=6525 |pages=800–803|doi=10.1038/374800a0|s2cid=4342260 }} < /ref >  It is now widely agreed that conodonts had large eyes, fins with fin rays, [[chevron]]-shaped muscles and a [[notochord]]. 
 
 The entire class of Conodonts, or at least what was left of them at the time, were wiped out by the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], which occurred roughly 200 million years ago. < ref > [http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/geo/16986180/articulos/JIGE9696120347A.PDF The extinction of conodonts – in terms of discrete elements – at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary] < /ref >
