It may or may not involve using [[number]]s; the computation of numbers and [[arithmetic]] is generally called ''[[wikt:calculation|calculation]]''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7536/Calculation-Computation.html|title=Calculation and Computation - Premodern, Early Modern, Non-western, Late Modern Period, Contemporary Period, Bibliography|publisher=Net Industries|access-date=25 January 2014}} < /ref >  The study of computation is called [[computer science]].
