 '''Shaka kaSenzangakhona''' (sometimes spelled '''Tshaka''', '''Tchaka''' or '''Chaka'''; ca. 1787 – ca. 22 September 1828) was the most important leader of the Zulu Empire. He joined the [[Zulu]] tribal groups together into the beginnings of a nation. This Zulu nation ruled a large area of [[southern Africa]], between the [[Phongolo River|Phongolo]] and [[Mzimkhulu River|Mzimkhulu]] rivers. His leadership and his energy make him one of the greatest Zulu chieftains. < ref > J.D. Omer-Cooper, The Zulu Aftermath, Longman: 1965, pp. 12-86 < /ref >  He has been called a military genius for his changes and new ideas. However, there were also brutal and cruel things that happened when he was in charge. < ref > See ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' article (Macropædia Article  " Shaka "  1974 ed.) < /ref > < ref > Donald Morris, The Washing of the Spears, Touchstone: 1965, p. 17-69 < /ref >   
 
 == Zulu leader == 
 Shaka maintained a good relationship with the [[Europe]]ans in Africa, including the [[Colonial]] leaders. He was disliked by other Africans, including his own people, who hated his constant wars.  
 
 Ten years of  warfare placed incredible strains on the Zulu nation. Shaka, unstable and worried about being replaced by an [[heir]], finally snapped into madness after the death of his mother in 1828. He imposed a year of [[Involuntary celibacy|celibacy]] on his people. He killed anyone who did not show enough sadness at the death of his mother. He was killed within the year by his half-brother, [[Dingane]], who succeeded him as ruler.  
 
 Even though he created brutal conditions for his subjects, he created the powerful Zulu Kingdom.
