 '''Flatworms''' ('''Platyhelminthes''', Greek  " platy " ': flat;  " helminth " : worm) are a [[phylum]] of [[invertebrate]]s. They are relatively simple [[animal]]s. They have [[wikt:soft|soft]] bodies.  
 
 With about 25,000 known [[species]], they are the largest phylum of animals without a [[body cavity]].  Flatworms can be found in [[ocean|marine]], [[freshwater]], and even damp [[Land|terrestrial]] [[environment]]s. < ref > Walker J.C.  &  Anderson D.T.(2001. The Platyhelminthes. In Anderson D.T. (ed) ''Invertebrate Zoology''. Oxford University Press. pp. 58â€“80. ISBN 978-0-19-551368-4 < /ref >   
 
 A troublesome terrestrial example is the New Zealand flatworm, ''Arthurdendyus triangulatus''.  It is an [[invasive species]] which colonized large areas of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]]. It was brought there by accident in the 1960s. Since then, it has destroyed most of the [[indigenous]] [[earthworm]]s. 
 
 Most free-living flatworms found in Britain are very small ranging from 5mm to less than 1 & nbsp;cm. They are usually black and can easily be mistaken for debris. These are mostly found in freshwater rivers or streams and are of the Turbellaria class. 
 
 Most flatworms (over 50%) are [[parasite|parasitic]] on other animals. There are four [[class (biology)|class]]es:  
 *[[Trematoda]] (Flukes): internal [[parasite]]s. 
 *[[Cestoda]] (Tapeworms): internal parasites. 
 *[[Monogenea]]: external parasites. 
 and  
 *[[Turbellaria]]: free-living flatworms, sometimes called 'Planarians'. ''[[Planaria]]'' is actually a [[genus]]. 
 
 Flatworms are one of the invertebrate groups which are studied in school biology. The main reason for this is that they may infect humans, [[pet]]s and [[domestication|farmyard]] animals. Some do enormous harm to humans and their livestock. [[Schistosomiasis]], caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by [[malaria]].  Effective [[treatment]]s are now available for these [[infection]]s. Also, in [[First World|first-world]] countries, regulations on domestic cattle prevent infected meat from reaching the human hosts.
