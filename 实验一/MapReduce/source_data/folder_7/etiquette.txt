 '''Etiquette''', one [[:wikt:aspect|aspect]] of [[decorum]], is a code that rules how everyone is expected to behave, according to the [[society|social]] [[:wikt:convention|conventions]] and [[:wikt:norm|norms]], in [[society]], in a [[social class]], or [[group]]. It is usually unwritten, but it may be put in written form. Because they are a product of the society's culture and history, the rules of etiquette are very different from time to time, and from one place and social group to another.
