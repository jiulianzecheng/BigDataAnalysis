[[File:Scientific classification.svg|right|100px|The hierarchy of scientific classification]] 
 
 A '''phylum''' ([[plural]]: '''phyla''') is the third highest rank used in the [[Biology|biological]] [[taxonomy]] of all [[organism]]s. The second rank is [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] and the highest is [[Domain (biology)|domain]]. Usually biologists count about 32 phyla of [[animal]] < nowiki/ > s, about 14 of [[plant]] < nowiki/ > s, and about 8 phyla of [[fungus]], but definitions vary. 
 
 With [[genome analysis]], groups of phyla have been put together based on [[evolution]]ary relationships. These are informal, not part of the standard [[Biological classification|classification]]. 
 
 [[Botanist]]s usually prefer the word ''[[division (botany)|division]]'' instead of ''phylum''.
