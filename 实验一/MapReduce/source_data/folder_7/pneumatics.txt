 '''Pneumatics''' is the use of [[compressed air]] for mechanical motion.  It has many uses. < ref > In [[dentistry]] applications, pneumatic drills are lighter, faster, and simpler than an electric [[drill]] of the same power rating (because the [[compressor]], is separate from the drill and pumped air is capable of rotating the drill bit at extremely high rpm). < /ref >   
 
 Pneumatic transfer systems are employed in many industries to move powders and devices. Pneumatic devices are also used where [[electric motor]]s cannot be used for [[safety]] reasons, such as deep in a mine where explosive dust or [[gas]]es may be present. 
 
 == Examples of pneumatic tools == 
 
 * [[Pneumatic drill]] (jackhammer) used by road workers 
 * [[Nailgun|Pneumatic nailgun]] 
 * [[Switch|Pneumatic switches]] 
 * [[Pneumatic actuator]]s 
 * [[Gas compressor|Air compressors]] 
 * [[Vacuum pump]]s 
 * [[Barostat]] systems used in [[Neurogastroenterology]] and for researching 
 electricity 
 * [[Cable Jetting]] - a way to install cables in ducts 
 * [[Pneumatic_tube#Pneumatic_Post|Pneumatic mail systems]] 
 * [[Air brake]]s on buses, trains, and trucks 
 
 ==Comparison to Hydraulics== 
 
 Both pneumatics and [[hydraulics]] are applications of [[fluid power]]. Pneumatics uses air, which is [[Physical compression|compressible]], while [[hydraulics]] uses relatively incompressible [[liquid]] media such as oil or water.   
 
 === Advantages of pneumatics === 
 
 * The working fluid is very light in weight so supply hoses are not heavy. 
 
 * Because the working fluid is (mostly) just air, there is usually no need for a return line for the working fluid and leaks of the working fluid tend not to be messy. 
 
 * Because air is compressible, the equipment is less likely to be damaged by shock.  The air in pneumatics absorbs excessive force, whereas the fluid of hydraulics directly transfers force. 
 
 === Advantages of hydraulics === 
 
 * Higher [[energy density]] owing to the much higher working pressures usually employed. 
 
 * The hydraulic working fluid is basically incompressible, leading to a minimum of [[Spring (device)|spring]] action. When hydraulic fluid flow is stopped, the slightest motion of the load releases the [[pressure]] on the load; there is no need to  " bleed off "  pressurised air to release the pressure on the load...
