 The '''Basters''' are a [[Southern Africa|Southern African]] ethnic group descended from Europeans and [[Bantu people|Bantu]] peoples, many are of [[Khoisan]] origin. Basters are closely related to Afrikaners, Cape Coloured and Griqua peoples of [[South Africa]], who share the [[Afrikaans]] language. 
 
 == History == 
 Since the 18th century, the Basters lived in the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] [[Cape Colony]]. Since the 1850’s, the Baster community mainly lives in central [[Namibia]], around the town of Rehoboth.  
 
 The name ''Baster'' is derived from ''{{ill|bastaard|nl|Buitenechtelijk kind}}'', the Dutch word for  " bastard " . Some people consider this term disrespectful and inappropriate. The Basters reappropriated it as a proud name, part of their ancestry and history, despite of the negative meaning. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|title=A Concise History of the Rehoboth Basters until 1990|last1=Britz|first1=Rudolf|last2=Lang|first2=Hartmut|last3=Limpricht|first3=Corenlia|publisher=Klaus Hess Publisher|year=1999|isbn=9991674713|location=Rehoboth|pages=12}} < /ref >   
 
 == Population == 
 The current population of Basters is unclear, around 35,000 < ref name= " UNPO 2015 "  / >  and 40,000 are estimated. Baster culture and identity might disappear. Modern Namibia's politics and public life is largely dominated by the ethnic Owambo people, nearly half of the Namibian population, and their culture. Baster politicians and activists have called Owambo policies oppressive towards their minority. < ref > {{cite news|last=Nunuhe|first=Margreth|date=18 February 2013|title=Rehoboth community in danger of extinction|work=[[New Era (Namibia)]]|url=http://www.newera.com.na/articles/50491/-Rehoboth-community-in-danger-of-extinction-|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130413155926/http://www.newera.com.na/articles/50491/-Rehoboth-community-in-danger-of-extinction-|archive-date=13 April 2013}} < /ref >
