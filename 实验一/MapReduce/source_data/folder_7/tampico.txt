 '''Tampico''' is the main [[city]] in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. 
 
 It was the site of an incident called the [[Tampico Affair]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the early 20th century that led to armed conflict between Mexico and the [[United States]]. About 80 years earlier Tampico was part of a less serious conflict between the two countries, called the [[Tampico Expedition]].
