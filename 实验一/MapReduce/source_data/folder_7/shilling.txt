 The '''shilling''' is a unit of [[currency]] used in some current and former British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. The word ''shilling'' comes from ''scilling'', an [[accounting]] term that dates back to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] times where it was said to be the value of a cow in [[Kent]] or a sheep elsewhere. The word is thought to derive from the base ''skell-'',  " to ring/resound "  and the [[diminutive]] [[suffix]] ''-ling''. < ref > [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shilling shilling - Definitions from Dictionary.com < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >  The slang term for a shilling as a currency unit was a  " bob " . 
 
 The abbreviation for shilling is '''s''', from the [[Latin]] ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', the name of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[coin]]. Often it was informally represented by a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], standing for a [[long s|long '''s''']]: ''e.g.,''  " 1/6 "  would be 1 shilling and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]], often pronounced  " one and six "  (and equivalent to 18[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]; the shilling itself was valued at 12[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]). A price with no [[pence]] would be written with a slash and a dash, ''e.g.,''  " 11/- " . Quite often a triangle or ([[serif]]) [[apostrophe]] would be used to give a neater appearance, ''e.g.,''  " 1'6 "   and  " 11'- " . In [[Africa]] it is often abbreviated '''sh'''. 
 
 During the Great Recoinage of 1816, the mint was instructed to coin one [[troy pound]] (weighing 5760 grains) of standard [[sterling silver|(0.925 fine) silver]] into 66 shillings, or its equivalent in other denominations. This effectively set the weight of the shilling, and its subsequent decimal replacement 5 new pence coin, at 87.2727 grains or 5.655 & nbsp;grams from 1816 to 1990, when a new smaller 5p coin was introduced.
