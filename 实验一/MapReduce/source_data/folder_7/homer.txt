 '''Homer''' is the name of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] poet who wrote the [[epic poem]]s the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/MINOA/HOMER.HTM|publisher=wsu.edu|title=Homer|access-date=2010-05-01|archive-date=2010-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527174651/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/MINOA/HOMER.HTM|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  These are the earliest works of Greek literature which have survived to the present day, and are among the greatest treasures of the ancient world. They are a product of [[Mycenaean culture]]. The Iliad tells the story of the [[Trojan war]], which took place around 1190 BC. The manuscripts of Homer were written much later, probably later than 800 BC. 
 
 ==The history== 
 What makes the history of this period so difficult is that the Mycenaean civilization was followed by several hundred years of decline, from which little or no writing has survived. This period, the [[Greek Dark Ages]], ended around 800 BC, when once again we find Greek writing, though this time in their newly developed [[alphabet]]ic script. Therefore, there is a distinct possibility that the Homeric epics had a life, perhaps a long life, as oral literature, spoken by story-tellers. 
 
 We know little about Homer, and the later Greeks also knew little about him. Some have doubted he was a real person; others think he was a [[woman]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.atrium-media.com/rogueclassicism/Posts/00004001.html|title=rogueclassicism: Homer a Woman?|website=www.atrium-media.com}} < /ref >   
 A [[legend]], has it that he was a [[blind]] poet who lived in [[Ionia]]. There is no definite evidence for any of these ideas. 
 
 There is [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that Troy existed. The site of Troy has been discovered, and excavated. Therefore, it is a fair guess that the epic began as a long oral poem based on the siege of Troy, but with details added and changed as time went on. < ref > E. Bakker 1997.

 ==The date of Homer, and the transcription== 
 The date of Homer's existence is not known. [[Herodotus]] said that Homer lived 400 years before his own time, which would place him at around 850 BC; < ref > [[Herodotus]] 2.53. < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://controversialhistory.blogspot.com/2008/03/date-of-homer.html|title=Controversies in History: Date of Homer|publisher=}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.gradesaver.com/author/homer|title=Homer Biography - List of Works, Study Guides  &  Essays - GradeSaver|last=GradeSaver|website=www.gradesaver.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/841/000087580/|title=Homer|website=www.nndb.com}} < /ref > < ref > http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NtFnt7Nod-0J:www1.pu.edu.tw/~bmon/Literature/Iliad.doc & cd=9 & hl=en & ct=clnk & gl=us{{Dead link|date=December 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.greeka.com/cyclades/ios/ios-history/Homer-ios.htm|title=Homer buried in Ios island - Greeka.com|website=Greeka}} < /ref >  but other ancient sources gave dates much closer to the time of the [[Trojan War]]. < ref > {{cite journal|author= Graziosi, Barbara|title=The invention of Homer|location=Cambridge|date=2002|pages=98–101}} < /ref >  The date of the Trojan War was given as 1194–1184 BC by [[Eratosthenes]]. 
 
 Today,  " the date of Homer "  means the date of the writing down the oral poems, rather than the life of Homer. This is called the ''transcription date''. The language suggests that the earliest possible date for the transcription is 800 BC, and the latest possible date is 600 AD. < ref > {{cite journal|author= Nagy, Gregory|title=Homeric poetry and problems of multiformity: the Panathenaic Bottleneck|publisher=Classical Philology|volume=96|date=2001|pages=109–119}} < /ref >
