 A '''vuvuzela''' is a blowing [[horn (musical instrument)|horn]] commonly used in [[soccer]] games in [[South Africa]]. They are also called '''lepata'''s or a '''stadium horn'''. To blow this horn, the [[lip]] and [[lung]] strength of the blower has to be strong to make a sound like a [[foghorn]] or an [[elephant]]. < ref name=fifa > {{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/destination/southafricafromatoz/letter=v/index.html|title=V is for Vuvuzela|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=9 September 2008|archive-date=14 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614093632/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/destination/southafricafromatoz/letter%3Dv/index.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Origin == 
 The ''vuvuzela'' was [[wikt:origin|originally]] made out of [[tin]]. It became very popular in [[South Africa]] in the [[1990s]]. A fan of the [[Kaizer Chiefs FC]] named Freddie  " Saddam "  Maake says that he invented the vuvuzela. He got the idea from the [[aluminium]] [[1965]] [[bicycle]] horn, and after taking off the black [[rubber]], he blew it. After that, he thought it was too short, and so he joined a [[pipe]] to make it longer. He has kept [[photo]]s of himself in South African soccer games holding the aluminium vuvuzela. He says the instrument was not allowed to be used because it was thought of as a dangerous weapon. Because of this, he tried to find a plastic company that could make it safer. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-01-08-vuvuzela-creator-blown-off|publisher=Mail  &  Guardian|title=Vuvuzela Creator Blown Off|first=Phathisani|last=Moyo|date=8 January 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2001, South Africa-based company Masincedane Sport began to sell the [[plastic]] version. < ref name=boogieblast > {{cite web|url=http://www.boogieblast.co.za/|title=The Boogieblast Vuvuzela|accessdate=9 September 2008|archive-date=20 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620002615/http://www.boogieblast.co.za/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Neil van Schalkwyk, the co-owner of Masincedane Sport, won the [[South African Breweries|SAB]] KickStart Award in 2001. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/SAB-moves-to-protect-vuvuzela-20040519|title=SAB moves to protect vuvuzela|date=19 May 2004|publisher=Fin24}} < /ref > 
 
 Vuvuzelas have been said to be rooted in African history, but this is argued between many historians. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.blatant.co.za/2009/06/pop/confederations-fu-cup/|title=The Real Vuvuzela Story|date=19 June 2009|access-date=11 June 2010|archive-date=15 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615012225/http://www.blatant.co.za/2009/06/pop/confederations-fu-cup/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  South African people used to blow on a [[kudu]] horn to call villagers to a meeting. Also, there is a South African saying that  " A [[baboon]] is killed by a lot of noise. "   Similar horns have been made for a long time by many people.  A horn that looks identical to a vuvuzela is seen in [[Winslow Homer|Winslow Homer's]] woodcut  " The Dinner Horn "  from the 1870s. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/brooklynmuseum-o2502-the-dinner-horn|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=The Dinner Horn}} < /ref >

 In the [[2010 World Cup]], vuvuzelas were in the news all over the world because it was normal in South Africa for them to be blown at football matches.  The world football governing body, [[FIFA]], did not want to allow the use of vuvuzelas. This was because they were afraid that [[hooligan]]s might use the instrument as a [[weapon]] and that [[business]]es could put [[advertisement]]s on vuvuzelas. However the [[South African Football Association]] (SAFA) said that vuvuzelas were important for South African games, and FIFA decided in July 2008 to let the instruments be used. < ref > {{cite news|title=Fifa gives Vuvuzelas thumbs up|date=11 July 2008|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/SWC_2010/0,,2-9-2188_2356051,00.html|access-date=11 June 2010|archive-date=6 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806050046/http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/SWC_2010/0,,2-9-2188_2356051,00.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Some football players and audiences did not like the vuvuzelas. The Lee Dixon of the [[BBC Three]] said that the sounds were  " quite [[wikt:irritate|irritating]] " . The European broadcasters also complained to the FIFA that they could not hear the [[commentator]]s because of the sound. 
 
 == Problems == 
 Vuvuzelas have also caused problems. With a Vuvuzela, high [[sound pressure]] levels can be reached. These are about 120 [[Sound pressure|dB(A)]] at a distance of one metre, and about 191 db(A) next to the instrument. < ref name= " Swanepoel " > De Wet Swanepoel, James W.

In [[Britain]] [[Tottenham Hotspur]] was the first football team to ban them in July 2010, and many other football teams have since followed.  They were banned because of [[health and safety]] reasons, especially because it was said that people might not hear any safety announcements. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/|title=Yahoo UK  &  Ireland - Sports News - Live Scores - Results|website=Yahoo Sports}} < /ref >
