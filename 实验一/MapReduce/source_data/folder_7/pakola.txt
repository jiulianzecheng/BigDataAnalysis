 '''Pakola''', derived from '''Pakistan-Cola''', is a line of flavoured carbonated soft drinks from [[Pakistan]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/653387/the-story-which-left-us-thirsting-for-more/ | title=The story which left us thirsting for moreâ€¦ | date=9 January 2014 }} < /ref >  Since the company's founding, many [[beverages]] have been introduced in the local as well as the international market, but none have overtaken the original '''Pakola drink'''. 
 
 == Varieties == 
 Several of the variants that have been introduced by Pakola: 
 
 *Pakola Ice Cream Soda (1950) 
 *Pakola Orange (1985) 
 *Pakola Raspberry (1985) 
 *Pakola Lychee (1991) 
 *Pakola Fresh Lime (2006) 
 *Pakola Water (2015)

 == Production == 
 Pakola is currently produced by Mehran Bottlers.  
 
 == Distribution == 
 Pakola is now available in the [[America]]s, [[Africa]], [[Australasia]], [[Canada]], [[Middle East]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. It is the only carbonated beverage manufactured in [[Pakistan]] that is exported globally. 
 
 == Glass bottles == 
 Due to the introduction of the capacity tax in 2013, Pakola discontinued the production and distribution of all glass-bottled products. The tax was levied on the overall production and distribution of the machinery instead of output, which was detrimental for companies with lower productions or smaller markets. After the collapse of this system, Mehran Bottlers quickly set up their PET lines to grasp the market once again.
