 A '''brocket deer''' is any species of [[deer]] in the genus '''''Mazama'''''. Medium to small in size, and are found in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and the island of [[Trinidad]]. Most species are primarily found in forests. They look similar to the African [[duiker]]s and the Asian [[muntjac]]s, but they are not related. About 10 species of brocket deer are described. 
 
 The [[genus]] name ''Mazama'' is derived from [[Nahuatl]] ''mazame'', the plural of ''mazatl''  " deer " . < ref > {{cite book | title=Native American Placenames of the United States | first=William | last=Bright | page=274 | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-8061-3598-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C & q=mazama+Nahuatl+deer & pg=PA274}} < /ref >

 ==Physical description and habitat== 
 Depending on species,  brocket deer are small to medium-sized with stout bodies and large ears. The head-and-body length is {{convert|60|-|144|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the shoulder height is {{convert|35|-|80|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and the typical weight {{convert|8|-|48|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, though exceptionally large ''M. americana'' specimens have weighed as much as {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. < ref name=walker/ > < ref name=Trolle > Trolle, M., and L.

 * ''M. americana'' and ''M. temama'' are usually found in forest. They are relatively large to medium brocket deer with a reddish to reddish-brown pelage. The head, neck, and legs are often grayish or blackish. 
 * ''M. gouazoubira'', ''M. nemorivaga'', and ''M. pandora'' are found in forest, woodland, and [[shrubland]].

 * ''M. nana'', ''M. bricenii'', ''M. chunyi'',  and ''M. rufina'' are found in forest and high-altitude grassland (''M. nana'' in [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic forest]]; the remaining species in [[Andean]] cloud forest, [[elfin forest]] and [[páramo]]). They are medium to small in size, and the pelage is reddish. In most, a part of the legs and the upper part of the head are blackish or dark gray, but in ''M. chunyi'', the foreparts and neck are also blackish or dark gray. < ref name=Trolle/ > 
 * ''M. bororo'' is found in Atlantic forest in southeastern Brazil.

 ==Behavior== 
 In addition to being small and [[nocturnal]], ''Mazama'' species are shy and are thus rarely observed. They are found living alone or in mated pairs within their own small [[territory (animal)|territory]], the boundaries usually [[urine marking|marked with urine]], feces, or secretions from the eye glands. When threatened by predators (primarily the [[cougar]] and the [[jaguar]]), they use their knowledge of their territory to finding hiding places in nearby vegetation. As [[herbivore]]s, their diet consists of leaves, fruits, and shoots. 
 
 ==Reproduction== 
 Mated pairs that live together remain [[monogamous]]. Single male deer usually mate with nearby females. When males compete for a mate, they fight by biting and stabbing with their short antlers. Brocket species that live in tropical areas have no fixed mating season, but those in temperate areas have a distinct [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]]ting period in the autumn. 
 
 The [[gestation]] period is roughly 200 & ndash;220 days and females bear only one fawn at a time. The young stay with the mother, keeping concealed until large enough to accompany her. They are normally weaned around six months of age and reach sexual maturity after a year.
