[[Image:King James II from NPG.jpg|thumb|right|The name of the movement derives from deposed Stuart monarch, [[James II of England|James II and VII]].]] 
 '''Jacobitism''' was (and, to a much smaller extent, is) the [[politics|political]] movement that tried to put the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings back onto the thrones of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. The movement took its name from the [[Latin]] form ''Jacobus'' of the name of King [[James II of England|James II and VII]]. 
 
 Jacobitism began after the deposition of James II and VII in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] jointly with her husband and first cousin [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. The Stuarts lived on the [[European mainland]] after that, sometimes trying to get back the throne with the help of [[France]] or [[Spain]]. The most important places of Jacobitism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the [[Scottish Highlands]]. In England, Jacobitism was strongest in [[Northern England|the north]], and some support was also in [[Wales]]. 
 
 A great number of [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] people liked Jacobitism. They hoped the Stuarts would end bad laws. Lots of different helped the military campaigns for all sorts of reasons. In Scotland the Jacobite cause became a lasting [[Romanticism|romantic]] memory.
