 '''Infrared''' ('''IR''') radiation is a type of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (a [[wave]] with [[electricity]]) . The wave is longer than [[light]] which humans can see and shorter than [[microwave]]s. The word ''infrared'' means ''below red''. It comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''infra'' (meaning ''below'') and the English word ''red''. (Infrared light has a frequency ''below'' the frequency of red light.) Red light has the longest wavelength that human eyes can see. Infrared waves cannot be seen by the eye. 
 
 Near-infrared waves are between [[1 E-7 m|800]] & nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] and 1.4 & nbsp;[[micrometre|'''µm''']]. Most infrared from the Sun is near-infrared. Thermal imaging is mostly done with [[thermal radiation]] waves between 8 and 15 '''µm.''' 
 
 People sense infrared as heat. 
 
 Most [[remote control]]s use infrared to send the control signals. Many [[missile]]s for [[anti-aircraft warfare]] find their target by infrared.

 Before [[Bluetooth]] was invented, some [[computers]], [[personal digital assistant]]s, and [[Cellphones|cell phones]] used infrared technology to send files to other devices. Bluetooth replaced infrared in the early 2000s. Infrared is limited by the need to have both devices in a  " line of sight "  with each other. < ref > {{cite news |title=Electronics unplugged - Bluetooth radio technology becoming reality in cellphones, printers, PDAs, headsets ... |first=Doug |last=Bedell |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |format=NewsBank |date=2002-08-29 |page=3D |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004 & rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:DMNB & rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx & rft_dat=0F5BDC0337F96215 & svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5 & req_dat=0EAD847D4966C8AF |accessdate=2010-12-13}} < /ref > 
 
 Infrared [[lasers]] are used to provide the light for [[optical fiber]] communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330 & nbsp;nm (least dispersion) or 1,550 & nbsp;nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard [[silica]] fibers.
