 A '''mongoose''' (plural mongooses, alternatively mongeese) is a member of the family '''Herpestidae''', a family of small [[cat]]-like [[carnivore]]s. Mongooses are widely distributed in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] the [[Caribbean]], and southern [[Europe]]. 
 
 == In popular culture == 
 A well-known mongoose written in [[fiction]] is [[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]], who has a [[short story]] of the same title in ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894) by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In this story set in India, the young mongoose saves his family from a [[Common Krait|krait]] and from two [[cobra]]s, named Nag and Nagaina. This story was later made into several [[movie]]s, and also a song by [[Donovan]]. 
 
 There is a Mongoose [[fictional character]] in [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[novel]], ''The Lair of the White Worm.'' The main character, Adam Salton, buys one to hunt [[snake]]s.  
 
 Game Freak's [[Pokémon]] [[media franchise]] has a Pokémon named [[Zangoose]], named after the mongoose.
