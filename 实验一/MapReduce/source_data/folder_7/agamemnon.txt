 '''Agamemnon''' ({{lang-el|Ἀγαμέμνων}}) was a legendary king of [[Mycenae]], as told in ''The [[Iliad]]''. The son of [[Atreus]] and Aerope, he was the brother of [[Menelaus]], and the commander of the unified Greek forces in the [[Trojan War]]. His wife was [[Clytemnestra]], with whom he sired [[Iphigenia]], [[Elektra|Electra]] or Laodike, [[Orestes]] and [[Chrysothemis]]. [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' tells the story of his quarrel with [[Achilles]], the greatest of the Greek warriors, in the final year of the war. Upon his return home from Troy, Agamemnon is murdered by [[Aegisthus]], the lover of Clytemnestra. The story of his return home and subsequent murder is featured in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (5.266).
