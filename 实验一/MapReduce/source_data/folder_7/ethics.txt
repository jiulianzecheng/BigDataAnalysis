'''Ethics''' is the [[study (field)|study]] of [[good and bad]] [[behaviour|behavior]]. It is [[one]] of the main parts of [[philosophy]]. Ethics tries to answer [[question]]s like: 
 
 * What [[action]]s are [[good]]? What actions are [[evil]]? 
 * How can we tell the [[difference]]? 
 * Are good and evil the same? 
 * How should we make hard [[decision]]s that might help or hurt other people? 
 * How do our actions affect others? 
 
 == Ideas about ethics == 
 When discussing ethics, the philosophy is generally separated into: 
 * [[thinking]] about [[morality]], 
 * the involvement of [[science]],  
 * the [[freedom]] of people to decide for themselves how to [[act]] within their own [[belief]]s. 
 
 ''Morality'' is what someone [[think]]s or feels is good or bad.  There are many [[different]] moralities, but they share some things.  For example, most people think that [[murder]] (killing somebody) is [[wrong]]. (compare [[Exodus]] 20:13)  Some philosophers hope to find more things that moralities [[share]].  They think that ethics should use the [[scientific method]] to [[study]] things that people think are good or bad.  Their work can be used to [[test]] the fairness of a situation, such as how people should [[treat]] each other.  An [[example]] of this [[kind]] of thinking is the [[categorical imperative]].  Many countries have laws based on this [[idea]] of fairness. 
 
 == What is ethics used for? == 
 Understanding ethics can [[help]] people decide what to do when they have [[choice]]s. Many [[mwod:philosopher|philosophers]] think that doing anything or making any [[choice]] is a part of ethics. 
 
 Ethics is part of other [[field]]s of study in many ways. Here are some ways: 
 
 * Ethics is part of the study of [[religion]]. In religion, people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about [[God]] (or gods). Some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion. See [[Ten Commandments]]. 
 * Some theories of [[economics]] say ethics has to do with [[money]]. Money is a big part of most people's lives. Thinking about morality can be important in economics. For example, there is a saying about ethics taken from the [[Bible]] that 'the [[love]] of money is the root of all kinds of [[evil]]' (1 Timothy).The philosophy of [[Marxism]] also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people. 
 * Government policy can be affected by what [[politics|politicians]] think is ethical. Politicians try to create [[laws]] that help everyone do what is right. Political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right. 
 * In [[work]], thinking about ethics can help with hard questions. Work can be like both economics and politics. Workers have to make money and follow laws. But the best way to do both is not always easy to know. The study of this is called business ethics 
 * People like [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[nurse]]s have to make [[wikt:hard|hard]] choices about how to [[health care|care]] for people. Sometimes the person being cared for, their [[family]] or the doctor do not agree what is best for them. Also, choices have to be made if there are enough [[resource]]s to help all. The study of this is called [[medical ethics]]. [[Similar]] studies for specific professions include [[bioethics]] and legal ethics. 
 * Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war. By talking about ethics, people hope to get what they want without being [[violent]]. This works when all people [[agree]] that [[peace]] is very important. But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong. So, sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without [[fighting]]. 
 
 Along with [[aesthetics]] ethics forms part of axiology, the philosophy of what people like.
