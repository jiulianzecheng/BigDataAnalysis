A '''bunkhouse''' is a simple [[building]], often with only one or two [[room]]s for lodging relatively large numbers of people, usually sleeping in [[cot]]s or [[bunk bed]]s lined up in rows. Bunkhouses are frequently used in camp settings like [[military base]]s, [[labour camp]]s, certain remote [[ranch]]es, childrens summer camps, and [[hostel]]s. Each room in a bunkhouse sleeps at least four people.
