 The '''bilby''' (also known as the '''rabbit-eared bandicoot''') is a [[rabbit]]-like [[marsupial]]. It lives in [[deserts]], dry [[forests]], dry [[grasslands]], and dry [[shrub]]by areas in [[Australia]]. The bilby's pouch faces backwards. These big-eared, burrowing mammals were in danger of [[extinction]], but now they are back living in [[New South Wales]]. < ref > Bilbies back in New South Wales.

 The bilby, like all [[bandicoot]]s, is a [[nocturnal]] animal (most active at night). Digging with its strong, clawed feet, this solitary mammal excavates long, complex burrows. Its underground dens are up to 5 feet (1.5 m) long. 
 
 Bilbies have the usual long bandicoot muzzle and big ears. They are about {{convert|29–55|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Compared to bandicoots, they have a longer tail, bigger ears, and softer, silky fur. The size of their ears allows them to have better hearing, and to radiate heat. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/wildlife/threatened-species/endangered/endangered-animals/bilby.html|title=Greater bilby|date=2003-08-08|website=Department of Environment and Science - Queensland Government|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-04-23}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/nature_conservation/wildlife/threatened_plants_and_animals/endangered/bilby/|title=Bilby - Australia's Easter bunny|date=24 November 2005|website=Environmental Protection Agency/Queensland Park and Wildlife Service|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323122123/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/nature_conservation/wildlife/threatened_plants_and_animals/endangered/bilby/|archive-date=2006-03-23|url-status=|access-date=2019-04-23}} < /ref >  They are nocturnal omnivores that do not need to drink water.  They get their moisture from food, which includes insects and their larvae, seeds, spiders, bulbs, fruit, fungi, and very small animals. Most food is found by digging or scratching in the soil, and by using their very long tongues.
