 A '''carbonate''' is a [[chemical]] [[chemical compound|compound]] that has the '''carbonate ion''', {{chem|CO|3|2-}}.  This [[ion]] is made of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]]. The name may also mean an [[ester]] of carbonic acid, an organic compound containing the '''carbonate [[functional group|group]]''' C(=O)(Oâ€“) < sub > 2 < /sub >  of carbon and oxygen.  They have a [[valency]] of 1. 
 
 When added to an acid, a carbonate will produce carbon dioxide, water and a chemical salt. [[Sedimentary rock]]s containing [[calcite]] and other carbonates are plentiful in the earth.
