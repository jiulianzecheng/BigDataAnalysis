 == History == 
 Words like  " alum "  and  " potash "  were used before modern chemistry developed. The word 'alumen' occurs in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''Natural History'' (23{{ndash}}79 [[AD]]). In the 52nd chapter of his 35th book, he gives a detailed description. Different substances were distinguished by the name of 'alumen', but they were all astringents, < ref > Astringent: causes body tissue to shrink or contract. < /ref >  and were all used in [[dye]]ing and medicine.
