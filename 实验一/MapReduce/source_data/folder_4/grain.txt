 '''Grain''' is the [[seed]]s of some special kinds of [[grass]]. The main types of commercial grain crops are [[cereal]]s. People grow different kinds of grain as [[food]]. The different kinds of grain are perhaps one of the most important foods in the [[world]].  
 
 Some kinds of grain are: 
 *[[Barley]] 
 *[[Maize]] ''or Indian corn (or simply as  " corn " )'' < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=corn|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition|access-date=2020-08-07|quote=Later, in the 17th century, another term for maize appears, Indian cornâ€”the word Indian here meaning  " native to the Americas. "  The American word corn in the specific meaning  " maize "  is simply a shortening of Indian corn.}} < /ref > 
 *[[Millet]] 
 *[[Oat]]s 
 *[[Rice]] 
 *[[Wheat]] 
 
 87% of all grain grown by farmers around the world is [[maize]]. Grains contain [[carbohydrate]]s that people can eat. In poorer countries, grains are a large part of the food supply. In richer countries, they are still important as food, but not as important as in poorer countries. Growing grain uses a lot of water. About 1,000 [[ton|tons]] of [[water]] is needed to grow one ton of grain. < ref > {{cite news|last=Knickerbocker|first=Brad|date=20 March 2008|title=Water shortages affect food, transit, security|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2008/0320/p17s01-sten.html|access-date=31 May 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 Many different foods are made from different types of grain. The part of the grain that people can eat is called the [[grist]], and the part they can not eat is called [[chaff]]. The grist is often ground into a powder called [[flour]]. Flour can be made into breads, cakes, or [[noodle|noodles]]. 
 
 Different kinds of [[beer]] are made from barley [[malt]], wheat, and other grains. 
 
 [[Tortilla]]s are made from a special flour of dried maize (corn) called ''masa''.
