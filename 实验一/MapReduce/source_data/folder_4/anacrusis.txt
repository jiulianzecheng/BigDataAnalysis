In [[music]] and [[poetry]], an '''anacrusis''' (plural ''anacruses'') is a very short introduction.  The word comes from the {{Lang-gr|ἀνάκρουσις}} (anákrousis), which means literally,  " pushing up " . It is a set of notes or syllables, perhaps just a single one. It comes before the first beat of a musical phrase, or a  line of poetry. It is not part of any musical phrase, or line of poetry which might have come before it. The word is sometimes used in publishing. It is very short, and not the [[introduction (writing)|literary]] or [[introduction (music)|musical]] introduction, [[foreword]], or with a [[preface]]). In music it is often called a  " pick up "  note. < ref > {{cite book|editor1-last=Randel|editor1-first=Don Michael|title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music|date=2003|publisher=Belknap Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-674-01163-5|page=42|edition=4th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC & pg=PA42|access-date=1 January 2015}} < /ref >
