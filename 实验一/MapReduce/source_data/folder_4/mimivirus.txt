 '''Mimivirus''' is an extra-large [[virus]]. It was discovered in 1992. 
 
 APMV was found accidentally inside the [[amoeba]] ''Acanthamoeba polyphaga''. < ref > {{cite journal|author1=Richard Birtles |author2=TJ Rowbotham |author3=C Storey |author4=TJ Marrie |author5=Didier Raoult |title=Chlamydia-like obligate parasite of free-living amoebae|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_the-lancet_1997-03-29_349_9056/page/925 |journal=The Lancet|date=29 Mar 1997|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)62701-8|volume=349|issue=9056 |pages=925â€“926|pmid=9093261|s2cid=5382736 }} < /ref >  The virus was seen in a [[gram stain]] and mistakenly thought to be a [[gram-positive]] [[bacterium]]. 
 
 It is either a [[virus|viral]] [[genus]] with a single [[species]], '''''Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus''''' (APMV), or it is a group of [[phylogenetic]]ally-related large viruses (MimiN). < ref > Ghedin E.  &  Claverie J. 2005. Mimivirus relatives in the Sargasso sea. ''Virology'' '''2''': 62. [http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/62] < /ref >   
 
 In speech, APMV is usually referred to as  " mimivirus " . Until October 2011, when an even larger virus ''[[Megavirus chilensis]]'' was described, it was the largest ([[capsid]] [[diameter]]) of all known viruses. < ref > {{cite news|title=World's biggest virus found in sea off Chile|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/8819432/Worlds-biggest-virus-found-in-sea-off-Chile.html|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=11 November 2011|location=London|date=11 October 2011|archive-date=11 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111065952/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/8819432/Worlds-biggest-virus-found-in-sea-off-Chile.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >    
 
 Mimivirus has a large and complex [[genome]] compared with most other viruses. Mimivirus, short for  " mimicking microbe " , is so called for its large size and [[Gram-positive|Gram-staining]] properties. < ref name='nature' > {{cite journal | title = Discovery of the giant mimivirus | journal = Nature Education | year = 2010 | first = D R | last = Wessner | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 61| id = | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-the-giant-mimivirus-14402410 | accessdate = 2012-01-07}} < /ref >
