 '''Bean''' is the name used for the seeds of plants. Most of these plants are known as [[legume]]s. Their scientific name is [[Fabaceae]]. [[Common bean]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s are some types of beans.  Beans contain a lot of [[fibre]]. They are also high in [[protein]]. [[Vetch]]es and [[lupin]]s are all in that group of plants but not all legumes are edible. [[Laburnum]]s for example are very [[poison]]ous as are some lupins.   
 
 The seeds of other plants (which are not Fabaceae), are sometimes also called beans. This is mostly because they look like true beans. Example for such beans are [[Coffee]] beans, [[Cocoa]] beans, and [[Vanilla]] beans.
