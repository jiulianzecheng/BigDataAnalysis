 '''Shoham''' ({{lang-he|שֹׁהַם}}, ''lit.'' [[onyx]]) is a town ([[Local council (Israel)|local council]]) in the [[Central District (Israel)|Central District]] of [[Israel]].

 == History == 
 A plan to establish a town in the area that is now Shoham was first proposed in the 1960s, as an idea to establish a town for immigrants from [[South America]]. < ref > {{cite news|last=Doketz|first=T.|date=August 25, 1965|script-title=he:הסוכנות תדון בקשיי קליטתם של העולים מדרום אמריקה|language=he|trans-title=The Agency Will Discuss the Difficulties of Absorbing Immigrants from South America|newspaper=[[Herut (newspaper)|Herut]]|url=http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=XqrnZgbJ1O4HIeDvAc4HdML6cPNrxDaF9FgmdTha7GNVw%2BwEjNArFvCU3N%2B3iqHjYw%3D%3D & mode=image & href=HRT%2f1965%2f08%2f25 & page=2 & rtl=true|access-date=April 26, 2019|archive-date=August 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816194431/http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=XqrnZgbJ1O4HIeDvAc4HdML6cPNrxDaF9FgmdTha7GNVw%2BwEjNArFvCU3N%2B3iqHjYw%3D%3D & mode=image & href=HRT/1965/08/25 & page=2 & rtl=true|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It was again proposed in the 1970s. However, residents of nearby [[Moshav|moshavim]] wanted to build a rural community for the adult children of farmers in cooperative communities. In the early 1990s, Israeli Housing Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] put forward a new plan to create a town in the area. Construction began in 1993, when the first 300 homes were built. From then on, the town grew rapidly. By 1995, it had 3,100 residents, and by 2014, had reached a population of 20,000. < ref name= " haaretz " > {{cite news|last=Bousso|first=Nimrod|date=April 22, 2016|title=As It Grows, Shoham is at Risk of Losing Its Small-town Flavor|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-as-it-grows-shoham-is-at-risk-of-losing-its-small-town-flavor-1.5439003|access-date=April 26, 2019}} < /ref >

 Shoham is a middle-class town, and residency there is considered a [[status symbol]] in Israel. In terms of average wages and the rate of high school students who complete their matriculation, Shoham residents rank well above the national average. < ref > {{cite news|last=Azoulay|first=Yuval|date=January 7, 2010|title=Shoham Residents Fight Shas Minister's Plan to Establish 'Superfluous' Religious Council|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5082867|access-date=April 26, 2019}} < /ref >  Its residential areas primarily have single-family homes with yards and [[Duplex (building)|duplexes]], although there are a few apartment complexes. According to ''[[Haaretz]]'', it has a small-town, community-oriented feel, but offers most of the services found in bedroom communities, including shopping centers, a high school, and a middle school. < ref name= " haaretz "  / >  The environment is considered a top priority in Shoham, and each neighborhood has municipal gardens and green spaces. The town's parks and gardens cover over 400 [[Dunam|dunams]], and are dotted with sculptures. The town has a performing arts center, sports facilities, a public library, and a retiree center and activity club. < ref > {{Cite web|title=מועצה מקומית שוהם|url=http://www.shoham.muni.il/?CategoryID=160 & ArticleID=93|access-date=2023-03-01|archive-date=2023-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230301101203/https://www.shoham.muni.il/?CategoryID=160 & ArticleID=93|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
