 '''''Notaden''''' is a [[genus]] of frogs.  They live in central and northern [[Australia]]. They are a digging frog. 
 
 == Description == 
 Its body is very round in shape with a short neck.  Its pupils are horizontal slits.  It has long arms and short, stubby legs.  Its fingers do not have webbing and its toes may have little to no webbing.  The skin is slightly warty.  Because it looks like some species of toads it is often incorrectly called a toad.  It lets out a poisonous sticky fluid from its skin when picked up.  It lays eggs in chains like some toad species.
