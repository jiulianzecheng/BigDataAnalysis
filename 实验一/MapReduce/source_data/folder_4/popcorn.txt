 '''Popcorn''' is a [[snack]] [[food]] made by heating certain kinds of [[corn]]. There is a small amount of water inside the seeds, which causes them to [[explosion|explode]]. When the seed shell breaks a sharp noise is made. The name  " pop "  is because of this noise. After it pops it is white and fluffy. 
 
 Salt and melted butter are often added to popcorn. Sometimes caramel and other flavors are melted and mixed into the popcorn. 
 
 Popcorn is a popular food to eat at the [[cinema]]. 
 
 == Kernel choking == 
 Many accidents of choking on popcorn kernels were reported. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/news/a41598/two-year-old-dies-after-choking-on-popcorn/ | title=2-Year-Old Chokes on Popcorn, Family Begs World to Take Warning | date=23 November 2016 }} < /ref >  This is because the popcorn kernel does go into the [[Respiratory tract|airway]] and [[throat]], and gets stuck. Many people want other people to take kernels out of the popcorn for children. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.today.com/health/popcorn-safe-young-children-eat-toddler-aspirates-kernels-t150742 | title=Mom warns about dangers of popcorn after toddler accidentally inhales kernels }} < /ref > 
 ==Pre-popped and home popped== 
 Popcorn that is [[already]] popped when you [[buy]] it is usually tastier and puffyer than just [[buying]] popcorn kernals and popping them with a [[microwave]]
