 Usually an injury is when the [[human body|body]] or a part of the body is damaged by something outside of the body. Another word for injury to a body is ''trauma''. 
 
 Injury can be by: 
 *Environmental – [[Burn]]s from heat or injury from cold 
 *Penetrating injury – when a sharp object like a knife pierces the body 
 *Blunt injury – when something hits the body (like punching someone or falling from a tree) 
 *Chemical – being hurt by [[chemical]]s like burns from [[acid]] 
 
 Injury can be ''accidental'' or ''intentional''. In an intentional injury a person ''tries'' to hurt another. (Intentional injury is also called ''non-accidental'' injury). [[Accident]]al injury is without meaning to hurt someone. A [[traffic collision]] for example may injure someone accidentally.
