'''Deutschlandlied''' ({{IPA-de|das ˌliːt dɛːʁ ˈdɔʏtʃn̩}};  " Song of Germany " ), officially known as '''Das Lied der Deutschen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃlantˌliːt|-|de-Deutschlandlied.ogg}};  " The Song of the Germans " ), is a song written by [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Hoffmann von Fallersleben]]. Part of this song is the [[national anthem]] of [[Germany]] ([[Deutsche Nationalhymne|German National Anthem]]). 
 
 A line from this song,  " Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit "  ( " [[Unity]] and [[:wikt:justice|Justice]] and Freedom " ) is the considered to be the unofficial [[:wikt:motto|motto]] of Germany. 
 
 ==History== 
 The [[music]] was written by Haydn in [[1797]] as the personal anthem of [[Francis I of Austria|Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was called  " Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser "  ( " God protect our [[Emperor]] [[Francis I of Austria|Franz]] " ). The words which are used today were written by the poet August Heinrich Hoffman von Fallersleben in [[1841]].  
 
 Today, the first line  " Germany, Germany above all "  sounds too strong for some people, and is often misunderstood. Fallersleben wanted a united Germany when he wrote it. At that time, Germany was not one [[country]], but many small [[country|countries]]. So  " Germany above all "  meant that the most important thing to do was to have a unified Germany. Also, the poet was written in [[Heligoland]], where people spoke German but were ruled by the [[Great Britain|British]]. 
 
 Fallersleben's music was very popular in Germany during the second part of the 19th century. This song was not a [[national anthem]] then, but a patriotic song supporting a united German state. On 11 August 1922, after 4 years of the end of the First World War and the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II, German Emperor,]] it replaced the previous anthem  " Heil Dir im Siegerkranz "  ( " Hail Thee in the Victor's Crown " ). In 1921, a  " fourth [[stanza]] " , a new part or verse, was written by poet Albert Matthai with words about the difficult life in Germany at that time.  This verse was rarely used. 
 
 During the time of [[Adolf Hitler]], only the first stanza of the song was used. This offended the international audience as the first stanza supports Germany holding colonial powers in non-consenting nations. This was often followed by Horst-Wessel Lied, the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]]. 
 
 After the [[Second World War]], Germany was divided into two countries. In 1949, the new [[West Germany]] tried to get a new song for the national anthem. Another song was chosen, written by poet [[Rudolf Alexander Schröder]]. It was not very popular. Finally, on 2 May 1952, President Theodor Heuss approved the decision to make Das Lied der Deutschen the national anthem of Germany. However, only the third stanza was used. 
 
 In the other part of Germany, known as [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]], the words of poet [[Johannes R. Becher]] ( " Auferstanden aus Ruinen "  -  " Risen from Ruins " ) were used with a song written by [[Hanns Eisler]]. It was not very popular, and from the 1970s the words were not sung, because of the line  " Germany, [our] unified fatherland " . 
 
 After East and West Germany united in 1990, the song again became the national anthem of Germany but only the third stanza is used. Today, the first part of the song is popular with [[nationalist]] [[extremist]]s.
