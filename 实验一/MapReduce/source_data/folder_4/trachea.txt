 The '''trachea''', or windpipe, is the [[bone|bony]] tube that connects the [[nose]] and [[mouth]] to the [[lung]]s, and is an important part of the [[vertebrate]] [[respiratory system]]. In [[mammal]] < nowiki/ > s, the trachea begins at the lower part of the [[larynx]] and continues to the lungs, where it branches into the right and left [[bronchi]]. [[Inflammation]] of the trachea can lead to other conditions, such as tracheitis, which is the inflammation of the linings of the trachea.

 The '''invertebrate trachea''' refers to the open [[respiratory system]] of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[arthropod]]s. It consists of [[spiracles]], tracheae, and [[tracheole]]s that take [[metabolism|metabolic]] gases to and from tissues. < ref > Wasserthal, Lutz T. 1998. Chapter 25: The open hemolymph system of Holometabola and its relation to the tracheal space. In ''Microscopic anatomy of invertebrates''. Wiley-Liss. {{ISBN|0-471-15955-7}} < /ref >   The distribution of spiracles varies, but in general each segment of the body has only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. 
 
 The smallest tubes, tracheoles, penetrate cells and [[diffusion|diffuse]] [[water]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon dioxide]]. Gas may be moved actively or by passive diffusion. Unlike [[vertebrates]], insects do not generally carry oxygen in their [[hemolymph|haemolymph]]. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Westneat, Mark W. |display-authors = etal  | title=Tracheal respiration in insects visualized with synchrotron X-ray imaging | journal=Science |date=2003 | volume=299 | pages=558â€“560 | doi=10.1126/science.1078008 | pmid=12543973 | issue=5606|s2cid = 43634044 }} < /ref > 
 This is one of the factors that may limit their size. 
 
 A tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of [[taenidia]] in various [[geometry|geometries]] such as loops or [[helix|helices]]. In the [[head]], [[thorax]], or [[abdomen]], tracheae may also be connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as [[grasshopper]]s and [[bee]]s, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a [[gill]], or function as normal, via a [[Gill#Plastron|plastron]]. Despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are shed during moulting ([[ecdysis]]).
