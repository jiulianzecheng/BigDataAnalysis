 A '''proton''' is part of an [[atom]]. < ref name=cox1 > {{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/wondersuniverse00coxb_864/page/n197 108]-109|title=Wonders of the Universe|url=https://archive.org/details/wondersuniverse00coxb_864|first1=Brian|first2=Andrew|last1=Cox|last2=Cohen|publisher=HarperCollins|date=2011|isbn=9780007395828}} < /ref >  They are found in the [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] of an atom along with [[neutron]]s. < ref name=cox1 / >  The [[periodic table]] groups atoms according to how many protons they have. A single atom of [[hydrogen]] (the lightest kind of atom) is made up of an [[electron]] moving around a proton. Most of the [[mass]] of this atom is in the proton, which is almost 2000 times heavier than the electron. Protons and [[neutrons]] make up the nucleus of every other kind of atom. In any one [[chemical element |element]], the number of protons is always the same. An atom's [[atomic]] number is equal to the number of protons in that atom.  
 
 Protons are made of [[quarks]]. < ref name=cox1 / >  A proton is believed to be made up of 3 quarks, two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]]. < ref name=cox1 / >  One down quark has a [[Electromagnetism|charge]] of -1/3, and two up quarks have a charge of +2/3 each. This adds to a charge of +1. A proton has a very small [[mass]]. The mass of the proton is about one [[atomic mass unit]]. The mass of the neutron is also about one atomic mass unit. The size of a proton is determined by the vibration of the quarks that are in it, and these quarks effectively form a cloud. This means that a proton is not so much a hard ball as an area that contains quarks.
