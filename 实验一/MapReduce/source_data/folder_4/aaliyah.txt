 In 2012 music producer Jeffrey  " J-Dub "  Walker via twitter said  " Just got great news today; the smash unreleased song called  " Steady Ground "  I produced on #Aaliyah is gonna be on her upcoming album " . Walker co-wrote  " I Refuse "  and  " What if "  from Aaliyah's third self-titled album and produced the song  " Steady Ground "  for her 'One in a Million' album. This second proposed posthumous album would feature this song using demo vocals since Walker claims the originals were somehow lost by his sound engineer. However, Walker's original tweet announcing this event has since been removed, and Aaliyah's brother, via Twitter, has stated that  " no official album [is] being released and supported by the Haughton family.
