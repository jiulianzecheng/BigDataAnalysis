 A '''recloser''' is a [[circuit breaker]] which can be closed automatically after the breaker has been opened because of [[Fault (power engineering)|electric fault]]. Because many faults in power systems fix themselves after they happen, the installation of recloser ensures more continuity of power and higher availability for electricity supply to the load.
