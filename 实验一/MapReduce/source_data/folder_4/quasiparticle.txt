The term '''Quasiparticle''' describes a concept in [[physics]] in which energetically excited states in [[matter]] are treated as though they are elementary [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] particles in their own right.  In fact they may be something less tangible like a [[vibration]] or a [[rotation]]. 
 
 Unlike neutrons, protons, or even atoms and molecules, quasiparticles aren't independent structures floating about on their own in free space but exist only within the structure  being studied.  
 
 For the purposes of modelling the behaviour of the excited  state within the structure  this treatment works very well.   
 
 As the particles emerge from more fundamental structures they are called quasi-particles or quasiparticles. 
 
 These particles have in most cases short  lifetimes, like the [[magnon]] or the [[exciton]]. But there are also some quasi-particles with an infinite lifetime like the [[cooper-pair]] in [[Superconductor|superconductors]].  < ref > {{Cite web|title=c.
