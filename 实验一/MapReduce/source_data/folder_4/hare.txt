 A '''hare''' (''Lepus'') is a [[mammal]] of the order [[Lagomorpha]], in the same [[Family (biology)|family]] as the [[rabbit]]. They are larger than rabbits and have black tipped ears. Their diet (the food they eat) resembles what rabbits eat; they eat ruttabaga and lettuce. They graze on [[grass]] and leafy [[weed]]s. 
 
 Hares are very fast-running animals. The [[European brown hare]] (''Lepus europaeus'') runs at speeds up to {{convert|35|mph|disp=flip|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{cite book| publisher = National Geographic Books| isbn = 9780792259367| last1 = McKay| first1 = George| first2 = Karen|last2= McGhee| title = National Geographic encyclopedia of animals| date = 2006|page=68}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web| last = Vu| first = Alan| publisher = University of Michigan Museum of Zoology| title = Lepus europaeus: European hare| work = Animal diversity web| accessdate = 9 January 2013| url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Lepus_europaeus.html}} < /ref >  The five species of '''jackrabbit''' found in central and western North America can run at {{convert|40|mph|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, and can leap up to 3m (ten feet) at a time. < ref > {{cite web |author=USA |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/jackrabbit/ |title=Jackrabbits, jackrabbit pictures, jackrabbit facts - National Geographic |date=11 April 2010 |publisher=Animals.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=2013-01-12 |archive-date=2010-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207174802/http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/jackrabbit/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They live [[wiktionary:solitary|solitarily]] or in pairs; a  " drove "  is the name for a group of hares. 
 
 == Mating season == 
 Normally a shy animal, they change their behaviour in spring, when hares chase one another around meadows. This may be competition between males to attain [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] (and hence more access to breeding females). < ref name= " disperse " > {{cite journal |author=Bray Y. |display-authors=etal |year=2007 |title=Natal dispersal of European hare in France |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=273 |issue=4 |pages=426–434 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00348.x |url=http://sebastien.devillard.perso.sfr.fr/pdf/Brayetal2007JZool.pdf |access-date=2018-05-05 |archive-date=2016-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006151555/http://sebastien.devillard.perso.sfr.fr/pdf/Brayetal2007JZool.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  During this spring frenzy, hares can be seen  " boxing " ; one hare striking another with its paws (probably the origin of the term  " [[mad as a March hare]] " ).

 == Snowshoe hare == 
 This is a [[species]] of hare found in cold climates in [[North America]]. As with the [[Arctic fox]], its hair is white in winter, and brown in the summer. These are different [[morph]]s. This ability gives it [[camouflage]], which it needs because it is the favourite food of the [[Canadian lynx]]. < ref > Krebs C.  &  and  Myers J. 2015.
