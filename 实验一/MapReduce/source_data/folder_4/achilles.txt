 '''Achilles''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Ἀχιλλεύς, ''Akhilleus'') was a hero of the [[Trojan War]] and is the central character of [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]''. The son of the mortal hero [[Peleus]] and the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]], he is the leader of the [[Myrmidons]], and is described as the greatest of all the [[Achaean]] warriors.  The ''[[Iliad]]'', which is set in the ninth year of the Trojan War, starts with a quarrel between Achilles and [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the Greek forces. < ref name=Fagles > Fagles, Robert (transl) 1990.

 Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was his slaying the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of Troy, as revenge against Hector for killing his lover, [[Patroclus]]. < ref name=Fagles/ > < sup > p53 < /sup >    While Achilles' death is not presented in the ''Iliad'' (as the poem ends with [[Hector]]'s funeral), other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the war by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him in the heel with an arrow. 
 
 == Legend == 
 Later stories depict Achilles as being invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel, as that is where his mother [[Thetis]] held him when she dipped him in the [[Styx|River Styx]] as an infant.  As such, the term  " Achilles' heel "  has come to mean a point of fatal weakness.  Because of that, his heel was still vulnerable.  However, the ''Iliad'' does not say this. 
 
 According to the legend, Achilles was killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot his heel with a poisoned [[arrow]]. Achilles was shot many times by the arrows of Paris but the only arrow found on his body was through his heel.
