 A '''town''' is usually a place with a lot of houses, but not a [[city]]. As with cities, there is more than one way to say what a town is in different countries. In some places, it is a kind of [[local government]].  When they say  " town "  people are normally thinking of a big, important place. It may even be a [[city]]. 
 
 Generally, a town is smaller than a city and larger than a [[village]], but that is not always the case, and the [[definition]] can differ in each [[country]]. 
 
 Generally, the difference between towns and villages or [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s is the sort of [[economy]] they have. People in towns usually get money from [[industry]] ([[factory|factories]] etc.), [[commerce]] (shops etc.) and public service (working for the town), not [[agriculture]] (growing food). 
 
 The number of people who live in a place does not tell us if it is a town or a village. In many areas of the world, like [[India]], a big village can have many more people than a small town. It is also difficult to say if a place is a town because today, some towns are becoming bigger. 
 
 Sometimes a place is a city because it got the name  " city "  by [[law]]. However, people often call a place a  " town "  if it is small. 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]], a place became a town by means of a [[town charter]], which gave it [[town privileges]]. 
 
 ==United States== 
 
 In the [[United States|United States of America]], the meaning of the term ''town'' is different in each [[state]]. In some [[States of the United States|states]], a town is a town if the state says it is. In other states, like [[Wisconsin]], a town is a subdivision of a county.  In other states, like [[Michigan]], the name  " town "  has no official meaning.  People use it to describe any place where many people live. 
 
 In the six [[New England]] states, a town is a smaller part of the [[county]].  In all six, towns do things that, in most other states, the counties do.  In many of these towns, [[town meeting]]s are the main form of government, so citizens can say what happens where they live by direct [[democracy]].  In these states, the towns are really more important than the county. In [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]], counties are only on the map and have no power.  In the other four states, [[court]] < nowiki/ > s are the main work of counties.  The counties with other functions are mostly in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]]. 
 
 ===Alabama=== 
 In [[Alabama]], whether or not a place is a  " town "  or a  " city "  is based on how many people live there. A place with 2,000 people or more is a city. A place with less than 2,000 people is a town (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104014/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-6.htm Section 11-40-6]).  For legislative purposes, places are put into eight categories based on the number of people. Class 8 includes all towns, and it includes all cities with that have less than 6,000 people (Code of Alabama 1975, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130616104906/http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/CodeOfAlabama/1975/11-40-12.htm Section 11-40-12]). 
 
 ===Kansas=== 
 All incorporated places in [[Kansas]] are called cities. Once a city is incorporated in Kansas, it will continue to be a city no matter what. There are three categories for cities: 
 *3rd Class Cities - When a city incorporates, it becomes a 3rd class city. To incorporate, a city must generally have at least 300 people living there. 
 *2nd Class Cities - A city may ask to become a 2nd class city when there are 2,000{{endash}}15,000 people living there. A city that has 2,000{{endash}}5,000 people may choose to still be a city of the 3rd class. However, they must become a 2nd class city when they have 5,000 people. 
 *1st Class Cities - A city may ask to become a 1st class city when at least 15,000 people live there. A city with only 15,000{{endash}}25,000 people may choose to still be a 2nd class city. However, it must become a 1st class city when they have 25,000 people. 
 
 ===Louisiana=== 
 In [[Louisiana]], a  " town "  is a place that has a [[municipal government|city government]], and it has 1,001{{endash}}4,999 people living there. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/gc021x2.pdf |title=Individual State Descriptions: 2002 |date= |accessdate=2018-04-18}} < /ref > 
 
 ===New York=== 
 In [[New York (state)|New York]], a town is also a smaller part of the county, but it is less important than in New England.  Towns provide almost all municipal services to places, called ''hamlets'', that are not in villages, and some services to places that are in ''villages''. In New York, a town usually has some hamlets and villages. But, because villages have power without towns (they are ''independent'') they can be in two towns or even two counties. Everyone in New York State who does not live in an [[Indian reservation]] (a special place for American Indians) or a city lives in a town, and perhaps in one of the town's hamlets or villages. A city may be part of a county, but even if it is surrounded by a town that has more people than the city, it is not part of the town. 
 
 ===Utah=== 
 In [[Utah]], the terms  " town "  and  " city "  is based on the number of people living there. A place with 1,000 or more people is a city. A place with fewer than 1,000 people is a town. Cities are divided into five different categories based on the number of people. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|title=Utah Code, Title 10, Chapter 2, Section 301|publisher=Utah State Legislature|accessdate=May 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808233054/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE10/htm/10_02_030100.htm|archivedate=August 8, 2011}} < /ref >

 == England and Wales == 
 In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the name  " city "  is only for places that have a [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]] (a special [[document]]) saying they can have that name. 
 
 In the past, cities usually had a [[cathedral]].  Some English people think that a place with a [[cathedral]] must be a city, but it is not true today.  For example, [[Northampton]], [[Blackburn]] and [[Middlesbrough]] (where is the cathedral??) are all towns with a cathedral. 
 
 In the past, a place was usually a town, not a village, when it had a regular [[market]] or fair (a market, but not so often). There are some English villages (for example [[Ipswich]], [[Oxfordshire]]) larger than some small towns (e.g. [[Middleham]], [[North Yorkshire]]).
