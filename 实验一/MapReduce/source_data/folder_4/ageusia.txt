 '''Ageusia''' is the loss of [[taste]] functions of the [[tongue]], particularly the inability to detect sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami (meaning  " pleasant/savory taste " ). It is sometimes confused with [[anosmia]] – a loss of the sense of [[Olfaction|smell]]. Because the tongue can only feel texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, most of what  we think of as the sense of taste actually comes from smell. Ageusia is a lot rarer than hypogeusia – a partial loss of taste – and dysgeusia – a [[wikt:distortion|distortion]] or change of taste. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Taste Disorders|url=http://www.masseyeandear.org/for-patients/patient-guide/patient-education/diseases-and-conditions/smell-and-taste-disorders/taste-disorders/|access-date=30 November 2018|website=Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary}} < /ref > < ref name= " pmid22558054 " > {{Cite journal|vauthors=Hummel T, Landis BN, Hüttenbrink KB|date=2011|title=Smell and taste disorders|journal=GMS Current Topics in Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery|volume=10|pages=Doc04|doi=10.3205/cto000077|pmc=3341581|pmid=22558054}} < /ref >

 == Diagnosis == 
 Aguesia is diagnosed by an otolaryngologist, who can look at a patient's loss of taste. To do this, a specialist will look into any other factors that could be causing the loss of taste, such as examining the head, nose, ears, and mouth. An otolaryngologist can also do of tests to assess the how bad the loss of taste is, which includes seeing specific tastes that a person can sense or recognize. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ageusia: Causes, Symptoms And Treatment|url=https://www.netmeds.com/health-library/post/ageusia-causes-symptoms-and-treatment|access-date=2021-03-26|website=Netmeds|language=en-US}} < /ref >   < ref > {{Cite web|title=Taste Disorders: Get Facts About Causes, Treatment  &  Symptoms|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/taste_disorders/article.htm|access-date=2021-03-26|website=MedicineNet|language=en}} < /ref >
