 The '''Westfjords''' or '''West Fjords''' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Vestfirðir'') is the name of a large [[peninsula]] and [[Regions of Iceland|region]] in northern [[Iceland]]. It is next to the [[Denmark Strait]] and faces the east coast of [[Greenland]]. The Westfjords have a lot of mountains and [[fjord]]s around the coast. Because of this, the road system is complex and communicating by land is difficult. 
 
 The largest settlement is [[Ísafjörður]], with a population of 4,000 people. 
 
 Because of the [[East Greenland Current]], the Westfjords are generally the coldest area in Iceland. 
 
 In 1615, 32 shipwrecked [[Basque people|Basque]] whalers were killed by locals. This caused the government to pass a law allowing the murder of any Basque person seen in the Westfjords. This law was ended in May 2015. < ref > {{cite news|last1=Tharoor|first1=Ishaan|title=Iceland revokes 400-year-old legal right in Westfjords district to kill Basques on sight|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iceland-revokes-400-yearold-legal-right-in-westfjords-district-to-kill-basques-on-sight-10278592.html|access-date=2 June 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=28 May 2015}} < /ref >
