 '''Skuas''' are a group of [[bird]]s of the [[genus]] ''Stercorarius''. They live near the [[ocean]] and have an aggressive lifestyle. They chase other birds to steal their catches, and they do fight, kill and eat other [[seabird]]s. < ref > Harrison, Colin J.O. 1991. In ''Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds'', (ed) Forshaw, Joseph. London: Merehurst Press, p109. ISBN 1-85391-186-0 < /ref >  Their victims include [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s, [[puffin]]s, and [[penguin]]s.  
 
 Skuas nest on the ground in [[temperate]] and [[arctic]] regions. They travel a long way to [[migrate]], and have even been seen at the [[South Pole]].
