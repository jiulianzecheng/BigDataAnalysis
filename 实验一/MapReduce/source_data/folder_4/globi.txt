 == History == 
 
 Globi was created in 1932 by the Globus stores as a [[advertisement|media vehicle]] for children. They wanted to address Globi to children. < ref name=swissinfo/ >  First, the figure was named  " Kimbukku " . Because the people of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of Bale named the Globus [[warehouse]]  " Globi " , they thought would be a better name than Kimbukku. The figure was well liked by the young customers from the beginning. First  " Globi "  appeared as a [[comic strip]] in the [[magazin]]e  " der Globi " . In 1935, the first book ''Globi the Childfriend'' appeared. This book has sold over a million copies. It was only really successful in Switzerland. Until today, 79 illustrated classic books have been published. < ref name=goethe/ >  The Globi books were always successful, but in the 1970s they were [[critic]]ized because of the [[racism]], [[sexism]] and [[violence]] in books of the 1940s and 1950s. < ref name=swissinfo/ >  Today, Globi is seen as [[politically correct]]. It started to be interested in [[ecology]] and [[animal rights|animal protection]] and became more of a [[role model]]. For example, in a newer volume, Globi goes with the small [[rhino]] named Najma to [[Africa]]. The readers learn about the problems of life in the [[savanna]] of Africa for rhinos. There was also a [[movie]] with Globi in the [[movie theater|cinemas]] in 2005. 
 
 == Publisher == 
 
 Because of the big success of Globi, the costs for the warehouse became too big. Because of this, Globi Publisher AG was founded in 1944.
