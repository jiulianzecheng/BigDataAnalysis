 '''Shinto''' ({{lang-ja|神道}}) is a form of [[Japan]]ese [[animism]]. It has many ''[[kami]]'', translated as [[Deity|gods]] or nature [[spirit]]s. Some  " kami "  are just spirits of certain places, and some are the overall  " kami "  (like  " Amaterasu " , the [[Sun]] goddess). The word  " Shinto "  comes from the Japanese words  " {{lang|ja|神}} " , ''shin''—the word for [[spirit]] or [[Deity|god]], and  " {{lang|ja|道}} " , ''tō''—the word for  " the way "  or  " path " . So, Shinto means  " the way of the gods. "   
 
 State Shinto was the main religion of Japan before [[World War II]]. During the period 1868 to 1945 the Japanese government used Shinto for [[propaganda]]. All Japanese were forced to register with their local shrine. All Shinto priests worked for the government. [[War]] was seen as a sacred duty. The [[Emperor of Japan]] was seen as a god. Japanese [[Buddhism]] was also involved with the war effort (See [[Zen at War]]). 
 
 Shinto has many [[ritual]]s and [[custom]]s, and some are done every day. Festivals are frequent. Some people mix Shinto and Buddhist rituals and beliefs.  
 
 * Although [[Jinja-Honcho]] manages almost all shrines, some, such as [[Yasukuni]], are run separately. 
 
 * [[Amaterasu]], the Sun Goddess, is seen as the holiest of all Shinto kami. [[Ise Shrine|Her shrine]] is in [[Ise]], [[Japan]].
