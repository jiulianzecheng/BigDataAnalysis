'''Turbotronic''' is a [[joystick]] made by [[Camerica]] in the late 1980s. It can [[Electrical connector|connect]] to a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (7 [[Lead (electronics)|pins]]) or an Atari joystick port (9 pins), used with multiple [[Atari]] and [[Commodore Business Machines|Commodore]] [[home computer]]s, [[game console]]s and the [[Sega Master System]]. < ref name= " vizard " > {{cite journal |last=Vizard |first=Frank |year=1989 |title=Tricked-out Videogames |journal=[[Popular Mechanics]] |volume=166 |issue=10 |page=106 |publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-MDAAAAMBAJ & pg=RA1-PA106 |accessdate=26 April 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 The Turbotronic and '''Freedom Stick''', a [[wireless]], [[infrared]] version only for the Nintendo Entertainment System that came out in 1988, looks like the [[NES Advantage]], released by [[Nintendo of America]] in 1987, < ref name= " vizard "  / >  so Nintendo sued Camerica. 
 
 It later became a new product, '''Supersonic the Joystick'''. A triangular base for right-handed and left-handed use was added, and [[suction cup]]s at the bottom to keep it stable. 
 
 Freedom Stick and Supersonic the Joystick are some of the first [[game controller]]s to use [[infrared]]. [[Brøderbund]]'s [[U-Force]] does it with no hands.
