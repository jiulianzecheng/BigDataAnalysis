[[File:Guanine Molecule.png|thumb|A Guanine molecule.]] 
 '''Guanine''' is one of the five main [[nucleobase]]s found in the [[nucleic acid]]s [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. 
 
 The others are [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[thymine]], and [[uracil]]. With the formula C < sub > 5 < /sub > H < sub > 5 < /sub > N < sub > 5 < /sub > O, guanine is a derivative of [[purine]].  
 
 == Basic principles == 
 Guanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA and uracil only in RNA.
