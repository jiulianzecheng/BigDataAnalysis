 The '''Valkyries''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Valkyrjur,'' singular ''valkyrja'' - “choosers of the slain”) are female figures in [[Norse mythology]]; they are a group of female warriors of [[Odin]] who do not get married. 
 ==Profile== 
 Alternatively the Valkyries are servants to Freya.  She negotiated with One Eye that her shield maidens would sort the honourable dead on the battlefield. Freya had first choice of half the slain to come to Sessrumnir, the other half were to be delivered to One Eye at Valhall.  
 
 Freya had fierce and respected warriors, they are responsible for choosing who live and die in battle, singling out those worthy of paradise. In the aftermath of battle, the Valkyries carry those whom they have chosen off to [[Valhalla]], an enormous and majestic hall that lies in [[Asgard]]. Once there, these [[einherjar|eïnherjar]], as they are now called, are shared between Odin and [[Freyja]], with half of them going to Valhalla and the other to [[Folkvang|Fólkvangr]], Freyja's realm. In Valhalla, the eïnherjar feast and make revelry, as they are served and cared for by the Valkyries themselves.  
 
 The old Norse people thought that Valkyries rode giant wolves, and that they had black wings which correspond to ravens; these two creatures both scavenge corpses on the battlefield symbolizing death and destruction. With the spread of [[Christianity]] the idea of what a Valkyrie was like changed more and more to a  [[Romanticism|Romantic]] description of a beautiful woman.  
 ==Operas== 
 [[Richard Wagner]] composed some [[opera]]s featuring Valkyries ([[German language|German]]: ''Walküren'', singular: ''Walküre''). These operas are ''[[Die Walküre]]'', ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'', and ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''. They feature a story of a Valkyrie [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]], her [[punishment]] for disobeying her father, and her falling in love with [[Siegfried]].  The [[music]] for the opening of Act Three of ''Die Walküre'' is very famous. It is called the ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]''.
