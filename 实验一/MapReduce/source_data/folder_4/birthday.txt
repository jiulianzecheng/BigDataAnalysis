 A '''birthday''' is the [[day]] when a person was [[Birth|born]]. In many places, on a person's birthday, he or she celebrates with friends and family at a [[party]], where they eat [[cake]] or other foods, and get [[gift]]s. It is a common use to offer gifts in packages decorated for the occasion and accompanied by greeting cards.

 Not everyone celebrates birthdays, including [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. 
 
 In much of the [[English-speaking world]] people sing the [[song]]  " [[Happy Birthday to You]] "  to the person celebrating her or his birthday.  There are similar songs in other [[language]]s. 
 
 A [[birthday cake]] is usually decorated and covered with [[candle]]s.  Usually the number of candles is the same as the age of the birthday person. 
 
 == Coming of age == 
 Children usually reach their [[age of majority]] on a birthday.
