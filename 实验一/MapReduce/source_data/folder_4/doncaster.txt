 == History == 
 Doncaster is an [[Ancient history|ancient]] city that developed from a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[fort]] called 'Danum'. It was built on a Roman road [[Ermine Street]], which linked [[London]] to [[York]]. The fort was built where [[Doncaster Minster]] now stands. However in the 4th century Roman civilization declined and the last Roman soldiers left Britain in 407 AD. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-03-14|title=A HISTORY OF DONCASTER|url=https://localhistories.org/a-history-of-doncaster/|access-date=2021-07-09|website=Local Histories|language=en-GB}} < /ref > 
 
 Later Doncaster developed into a [[medieval]] cityship with a fortified [[boundary]] and historic [[gate]]s. What remains of the gates can still be seen in the city today. Conisbrough Castle was built here after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] and, following a slow building up of markets across the centuries, the city quickly became the most profitable of its size in the county. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Andy|date=2020-05-21|title=Why Visit Doncaster?|url=https://theexpertcamper.co.uk/blog/places-to-visit/why-visit-doncaster/|access-date=2022-04-26|website=The Expert Camper|language=en-GB}} < /ref > 
 
 Doncaster also has a market which has existed for over 750 years.  
 
 As the centuries passed, Doncaster became an important city post on the route between London and [[Edinburgh]]. An ancient road called the [[Great North Road]] passed straight through the very centre of Doncaster, and the city grew around and along this road. 
 
 == Trains == 
 When railways were invented, Doncaster became famous for [[Steam engine|steam trains]]. It was an important stop for trains travelling between [[Scotland]] and London. It is still an important stop today. A big factory for making trains was built in Doncaster. Some of the finest and fastest steam trains in the world were built in Doncaster. These trains include ''The Flying Scotsman'', ''The Mallard'', and ''The Sir Nigel Gresley''. The station also houses a unique Victorian themed bar on platform 3b.  
 
 == Aeroplanes == 
 Doncaster was one of the first places in the country that made [[aeroplane]]s and had an airport. The first [[airshow]] in the country was held in Doncaster in 1908. 
 
 Doncaster has an [[international airport]] which was opened in 2005. The airport is growing very fast and lots of people from across the region and across [[Europe]] now use Doncaster as a popular destination â€“ which is something that people have already been doing for the last 2000 years.
