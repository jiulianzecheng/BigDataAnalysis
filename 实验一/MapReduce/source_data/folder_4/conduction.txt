'''Conduction''' in [[physics]] is about forms of energy, namely [[heat]] or [[electricity]]. 
 
 * [[Heat conduction]] takes place between two objects in contact with each other.  Heat [[energy]] moves from one to the other.  In heat conduction, the heat energy travels from the hot point to a cold point.  Eventually, the two materials will even out in temperature as the heat keeps on transferring until the temperatures are the same.  This is [[equilibrium]].  For example, a [[pan]] of hot [[soup]] is taken off the [[oven]] and put on a [[Table (furniture)|table]].  The area of the table under the pot gets hot.  Heat from the pot moved to the table top by conduction.  
 
 * [[Electrical conduction]] is usually done through wires or cables. Something that [[electrons]] can easily move through is a good electrical conductor.  [[Metal]]s are mostly  good conductors.  An [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]] like [[rubber]] is a poor conductor.  [[Plastic]]s are insulators.  Some materials, such as [[glass]], are conductors for heat but not electricity. 
 
 Besides conduction, the other major ways of moving energy are by [[radiation]] and [[convection]].
