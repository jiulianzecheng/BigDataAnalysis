Further in their bardic traditions as well as in popular stories the Chudasamas are still commonly called Ahera-ranas. The position of Aberia in Ptolemy (A.D. 150) seems to show that in the second century the Ahirs were settled between Sindh and the Panjab. Similarly it may be suggested that Jadeja is a corruption of Jaudheja which in turn comes from Yaudheya (the change of y to j being very common) who in Kshatrapa Inscriptions appear as close neighbours of the Ahirs. After the fall of the Valabhis (A.D. 775) the Yaudheyas seem to have established themselves in Kacch and the Ahirs settled and made conquests in Kathiavada.}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.36138|title=Abhiras their history and culture|last=SurvaVanshi|first=Bhagwansingh|date=1962|quote=Hemachandra in his Dvyasrayakavya mentions Graharipu, as a mighty Abhira-Chudasama king of Saurashtra.
