 '''Stretching''' is a kind of [[physical fitness]] exercise in which a [[muscle]] (or muscle group) is stretched on purpose to its fullest length in order to help the muscle's [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and its tone. < ref > (Weerapong et al. 189–206) < /ref >  This helps a person have better control of his or her muscles and be more flexible. 
 
 Stretching, in its most basic form, is a natural and [[instinctive]] activity; it is done by many [[animals]] including [[humans]]. It may be done while [[yawn]]ing. Stretching often is done instinctively after waking from sleep, after long periods of being inactive, or after leaving small spaces and areas. 
 
 Many [[Sportsperson|athletes]] and [[dancer]]s stretch deliberately before or after exercise in order to enhance [[performance]] and reduce [[injury]].  
 
 There are three basic types of stretching: ballistic, dynamic, and static stretching.
