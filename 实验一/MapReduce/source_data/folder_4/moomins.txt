 The '''Moomins''' ({{lang-sv|Mumintroll}}) are the main characters in a series of [[book]]s and a [[comic strip]] by [[Swedish-Finn|Swedish-speaking Finnish]] illustrator and writer [[Tove Jansson]], originally published in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] by Schildts < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://schildts.asiakkaat.sigmatic.fi/mumin.html |title=Publisher's webpage about the Moomins (in Swedish only) |access-date=2016-01-02 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230719/http://schildts.asiakkaat.sigmatic.fi/mumin.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  in [[Finland]].  
 
 They are a family of white, roundish fairy tale characters with large [[snouts]] that make them look like [[hippopotamus]]es. The carefree and adventurous family live in their house in [[Moominvalley]], though in the past, their part-time residences have included a [[lighthouse]] and a [[theatre]]. They have had many adventures along with their various friends. 
 
 In all, nine books were released in the series, together with five picture books and a [[Moomin comic strips|comic strip]] being released between 1945 and 1993. 
 
 The Moomins have since been the subject for many television series, movies and even a theme park called [[Moomin World]] in [[Naantali]], [[Finland]].
