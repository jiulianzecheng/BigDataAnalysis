 '''Porridge''' is a food which is made with a [[cereal]], usually [[oat]]s.  The oats are boiled in [[water]] or [[milk]], or both. It is usually served hot in a bowl or dish.  Some people add things to their porridge such as [[sugar]] or [[syrup]]. In [[Scotland]] [[salt]] is often added. < ref >  Welch R.W. ed 1995. ''The oat crop: production and utilization''.

 Porridge is a traditional food in many countries in Northern [[Europe]].  It is usually eaten for [[breakfast]].  In some countries [[barley]] or other grains may be used.  Porridge is cooked in [[saucepan]]s or in a [[microwave]].  Traditionally, it was cooked in large metal [[kettle]]s over hot coals. Porridge was often served as food for prisoners in [[prison]]s.  This is why in [[English language|English]] there is a [[slang]] expression  " doing porridge "  which means  " being in prison " . Porridge is also given to people who are ill because it is healthy and easy to eat and digest. 
 
 [[Semolina]] and [[gruel]] are foods which are quite similar to porridge. Semolina is usually served as a [[pudding]]. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge that may be also drunk and may not need to be cooked. [[Oliver Twist]], in the famous book by [[Charles Dickens]], was given gruel to eat. 
 
 Historically, heavy foods were eaten because most work was manual. Before the [[industrial revolution]], men and women doing hard work needed more [[calories]] per day than they need today. At any rate this applies to countries which are highly mechanized. Porridge is a good example of the heavy calorie-laden food which has gradually gone out of favor.
