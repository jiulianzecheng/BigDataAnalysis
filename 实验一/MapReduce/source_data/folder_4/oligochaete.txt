 }}'''Oligochaetes''' are a [[subclass]] of worms in the [[phylum]] [[Annelida]]. 
 
 With around 10,000 [[species]] the Oligochaetes make up about a half of the phylum Annelida. These worms usually have few chaetae or  " bristles "  on the outer body surface, unlike [[polychaetes]]. The best known is the [[garden]] [[earthworm]]. 
 
 Oligochaetes are [[segment]]ed worms and most have a spacious body cavity ([[coelom]]) which is used as a hydroskeleton. They range in length from less than 0.5 millimetres (0.020 in) up to 2 to 3 metres (6.6 to 9.8 ft) in the 'giant' species such as the [[Giant Gippsland Earthworm]] and the Mekong Worm ''Amynthas mekongianus''.
