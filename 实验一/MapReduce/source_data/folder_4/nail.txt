 A '''nail''' is a [[metal]] object with a flat head and a long, sharp tip. A [[hammer]] or [[nail gun]] is used to put it into another object. It is often used to join two objects together. 
 
 The history of the nail came in three periods: 
 # Hand-wrought (forged) nail (pre-history until 19th century) 
 # Cut nail (roughly 1800 to 1914) 
 # Wire nail (roughly 1860 to the present)
