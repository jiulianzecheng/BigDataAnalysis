 '''Pentatomoidea''' is a [[superfamily]] of [[bugs]] in the [[Heteroptera]] suborder. < ref > {{cite book|last=Sexton|first=Colleen|title=Stink Bugs|publisher=Bellwether Media|date=August 1, 2008|isbn=978-1-60014-192-8}} < /ref >  They are often called '''shield bugs''' or '''stink bugs'''. They are very common, with about 7000 [[species]]. 
 
 They share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ento.csiro.au/education/insects/hemiptera.html |title=Hemiptera: bugs, aphids and cicadas |publisher=[[CSIRO]] |accessdate=2007-05-08 |archive-date=2013-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709163308/http://www.ento.csiro.au/education/insects/hemiptera.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They have a kind of tough shield on their back. It is part of the [[thorax]] which goes back over the [[abdomen]]. They also have [[glands]] between the first and second pair of legs. These glands produce a foul-smelling liquid. The shield and foul liquid work to [[wikt:deter|deter]] potential [[predators]]. Their young, called 'nymphs', also have stink glands. 
 
 There are 15 families in this group. One of them, the [[Pentatomidae]] are especially known as stink bugs. It is the largest family in Pentatomoidea, with about  900 [[genera]] and over 4700 species.
