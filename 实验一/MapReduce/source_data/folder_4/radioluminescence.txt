 '''Radioluminescence''' is a way that some [[radioactive]] materials produce [[light]]. It is seen around some very strong sources of [[Cherenkov radiation|radiation]]. Radioluminescent [[paint]] is used for clock hands and signs to make them easier to see in the dark.  
 
 == How it works == 
 Radioluminescence happens when an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] gets energy from [[ionizing radiation]]. The energy is released as a [[photon]] of light. < ref > {{cite book|first=T.|last=Lauer|date=18 June 2015|chapter=Radioluminescence (RL)|title=Encyclopedia of Scientific Dating Methods|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-6304-3_104}} < /ref >  A [[chemical]] that releases one type of light when it gets energy from ionizing radiation is called a [[phosphor]]. Radioluminescent materials are made by mixing something radioactive with a phosphor. 
 
 == Uses ==

 Radioluminescence is mostly used to make things visible in the dark. Most radioluminescent paint has [[radium]], [[promethium]], or [[tritium]]. 
 
 === Radium === 
 [[Radium]] was the first element used in radioluminescent paint. It was first used in 1908. The green light was made by mixing radium with [[zinc sulfide]] and [[copper]]. Other metals such as [[manganese]] and [[silver]] were used to make different colors of paint. Radium stopped being used in paint in the 1960s. < ref name= " Tykva " > {{cite book

 === Promethium === 
 The [[isotope]] [[promethium]]-147 replaced radium in radioluminescent paint after the 1960s. It is less dangerous than radium. However, promethium-147 has a [[half-life]] of 2.62 years, so it does not last as long as radium or tritium.{{NUBASE2020|ref}} 
 
 === Tritium === 
 Most radioluminescent materials now use [[tritium]], which is a radioactive isotope of [[hydrogen]]. It is also less dangerous than radium, but it is a gas, so it cannot be mixed in paint. Tritium is put inside of [[glass]] tubes that have phosphor on the inside.
