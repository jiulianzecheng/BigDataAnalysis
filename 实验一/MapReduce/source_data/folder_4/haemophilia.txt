 '''Haemophilia''' is a [[blood]] condition that means [[bleeding]] does not stop. The bleeding occurs because the blood does not [[blood clot|clot]]. People with hemophilia lack proteins in the blood that make scabs and blood clots. < ref name= " Green, David 2016 " > Green, David.  " Hemophilia. "  World Book Advanced. World Book, 2016. Web. 22 Feb. 2016. < /ref >  A person with a small cut or internal bleeding ([[bruise]]) could [[Exsanguination|bleed to death]]. They do not bleed more than a normal person, but they bleed for much longer. The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''haima'' ( " blood " ) and ''philia'' ( " to love " ). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hemophilia & searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|author=Douglas Harper|accessdate=2007-10-10}} < /ref >  To treat this, an affected person can get a [[blood donation]] from someone without hemophilia. The donor’s blood has clotting proteins and can temporarily make a normal scab. < ref > " HEMOPHILIA. "  SICK! Diseases and Disorders, Injuries and Infections. Online Edition. Detroit: UXL, 2008. < /ref >  30% of hemophilia A and B cases are the first person in their family to have hemophilia which is the result of an unexpected mutation (this means that there is an unexpected change in the body). < ref name= " Green, David 2016 " / > 
 
 It usually affects [[male]]s. It is passed from mother to child through [[gene]]s. 
 
 There are 3 types of haemophilia: 
 * Haemophilia A - about 90% of cases. There is no blood clotting ability. 
 * Haemophilia B - not as severe, but much less common. There is not enough blood clotting ability. 
 * Haemophilia C - caused by not one, but two [[recessive]] (weak) genes. 
 
 Haemophilia A happens in about 1 in 5,000–10,000 male births. < ref name =  " qzmtku " > {{cite web |url=http://www.hemophilia.org/NHFWeb/MainPgs/MainNHF.aspx?menuid=181 & contentid=46 & rptname=bleeding |title=Hemophilia B |accessdate=2007-11-21 |format= |work=}} < /ref >  Haemophilia B happens in about 1 in every 20,000–34,000 male births. 
 
 [[Genetic disorder|Genetic defects]] on the [[X chromosome]] affect males because they have only one X chromosome. In females, a recessive gene is usually masked by a normal gene on the other X chromosome. The [[Y chromosome]] does carry some genes, but far fewer than the X chromosome. Defects of this type are called  " sex-linked "  in [[genetics]]. There is no cure for this disease but there are different treatments available around the world. 
 
 A person with haemophilia is called a haemophiliac.
