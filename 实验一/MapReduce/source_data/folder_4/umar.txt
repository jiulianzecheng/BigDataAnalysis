 '''ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb''' ({{lang-ar|عمر بن الخطاب}}, also spelled '''Omar''', {{circa|586/589 – 644}}) was the second [[Rashidun|Rashidun caliph]]. He ruled from August 634 until his assassination in 644. He succeeded [[Abu Bakr]] ({{reign|632|634}}) as the second caliph of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] on 23 August 634. Umar was a [[Companions of the Prophet|companion]] of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. He was also a father-in-law of Muhammad. Umar was an expert [[Faqīh|Muslim jurist]]. He was known for his pious and just nature. It earned him the [[epithet]] ''al-Farooq''. This meand  " the one who distinguishes (between right and wrong) " . 
 
 At first, Umar opposed Muhammad. After his conversion to Islam in 616, Umar became the first [[Muslims|Muslim]] to openly pray at the [[Kaaba]]. Umar fought in almost all battles under Muhammad. After Muhammad's death in June 632, Umar pledged allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]] ({{Reign|632|634}}) as the first caliph. Umar served as the closest adviser to the Bakr until August 634. It was then that the dying Abu Bakr made Umar his successor. 
 
 Under Umar, the caliphate expanded. It ruled the [[Sasanian Empire]] and more than two-thirds of the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfnp|Hourani|1991|p=23}} His attacks on the Sasanian Empire resulted in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia#Conquest of Persia (642–651)|conquest of Persia]] in less than two years. [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]] says that Umar set aside the [[Christianity|Christian]] ban on [[Jews]] and let them into [[Jerusalem]] and to worship. < ref > {{cite book|last=Dubnow|first=Simon|title=History of the Jews: From the Roman Empire to the Early Medieval Period|year=1968|publisher=Cornwall Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZ2MwNzB69IC & pg=PA326|volume=2|page=326|isbn=978-0-8453-6659-2}} < /ref >  Umar was assassinated by the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Slavery|slave]] [[Abu Lu'lu'a Firuz]] in November 644.{{Efn|The date of Umar's death in the [[Islamic calendar]] is disputed. Although the sources are unanimous that Umar was stabbed in the last week of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]], he reportedly died a few days later. According to an account of the 8th-century Medinian historian [[Ibn Ishaq]] (d. 767), Umar was stabbed on the 27th of Dhu al-Hijjah and died on the 1st of Muharram. In the work of [[al-Tabari]] (d. 923), Umar is variously reported to have died on 26th of Dhu al-Hijjah, 27th of Dhu al-Hijjah or the 1st of Muharram.{{sfn|Smith|2015|93–95}}}}
