 '''Gallimimus''' ([[chicken]] mimic) was a fast-running [[dinosaur]]. It had a long, thin, flattened, toothless, horny beak, a small [[head]], and a relatively large [[brain]]. ''Gallimimus'' lived in the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 75-70 million years ago. 
 
 == Description == 
 The bottom front part of its beak was shaped like a [[shovel]]. It had large eyes positioned on opposite sites of its head, ruling out binocular vision (depth perception). It had a long neck, long tail, and long legs. Gallimimus was about 13-20 ft (4-6 m) long, was 6.3 ft (1.9 m) tall at the hips, and may have weighed about 970 pounds (440 kg). 
 
 These were probably among the fastest of all dinosaurs. < ref name= " Holtz2008 " > Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. 2012.
