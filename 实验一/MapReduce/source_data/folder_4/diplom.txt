'''Diplom''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|Δίπλωμα}} ''[[diploma]]'') is a high level [[degree (school)|degree]] awarded for learning. It is awarded in European countries such as [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Estonia]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Greece]]. It is a similar award to the [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor's]] and [[master's degree|Master's]] degrees in other countries.  
 
 The Diplom was first awarded when the ''[[Technische Hochschule]]n'' became a university.  
 
 The diplom is slowly being replaced by a system that awards Bachelor's and Master's degrees. Bachelor's degrees, sometimes called ''Bakkalaureus'' in Germany, are thought of as a  " small Diplom " .

 The Diplom may be awarded by the two types of German [[university]]. At a University of Applied Sciences ([[Fachhochschule]]), the diploma degree is called a ''Diplom (FH)'' and normally takes four years to study and gain [[work experience]]. At a ''Universität'' the degree is called a ''Diplom'' or sometimes a ''Diplom (Univ.)'' and takes four or five years.  These years are called  " regular study time "  (''Regelstudienzeit'') but study for the universität normally takes longer. 
 
 The ''Diplom'' is the first university award for many students. There has been no Bachelor's degree in the German/Austrian educational system.  
 
 To win the Diplom certificate, a student must pass the tests for the ''Hauptstudium'' (main study time) after the ''Vordiplom'', then one or more ''Studienarbeit'' (study research projects), and then write a ''Diplomarbeit'' (diploma [[wikt:thesis|thesis]]). The [[wikt:curriculum|curriculum]] of diplom studies at a University of Applied Sciences ([[Fachhochschule]]) is focused on using (applying) the science. The Universität is focused on learning. 
 
 A student must have a ''Diplom'' before studying for a [[PhD]] (''Doctorate''). The diplom qualifies a student to study for a doctorate in most other countries. 
 
 This chart is a guide to the number of years of university study needed in a diplom system to begin studying for a [[doctorate]]:

 '''Note''': For the Diplom (FH) a student has to spend two years with a [[company]] where he or she does not study before studying for a doctorate. These years are shown as  " additional work "  in the table. 
 
 '''Also note''': A Diplom student can begin the doctorate without the additional work if their work has been good enough. < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/gleichstellungsbeauftragte/promovieren/fhdiplom.html|title= Promovieren mit FH-Diplom|accessdate= 2008-02-12|archive-date= 2008-09-17|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080917053055/http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/gleichstellungsbeauftragte/promovieren/fhdiplom.html|url-status= dead}} < /ref >  Normally a Master's course is taken before a doctorate.
