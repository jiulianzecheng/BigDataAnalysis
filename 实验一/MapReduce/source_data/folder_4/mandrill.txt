 The '''mandrill''' (''Mandrillus sphinx'') are the world's largest [[monkeys]]. They are also the most colourful [[primates]]. The skin colours brighten as the animal gets more excited. Males live mostly on the forest floor, while females and young climb up into trees and bushes. This monkey looks rather like a [[baboon]], but they are in a different [[genus]]. They live in large groups, mostly in [[rain forests]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 Males have an orange/yellow beard and an unmistakable bright red and blue snout and rump. Females and juveniles have a duller blue snout and a buff beard. Mandrills can live up to 40 years in captivity. They feed on [[fruit]]s, [[Leaf|leaves]], [[root]]s, [[seed]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[green]]s and [[invertebrate]]s. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Mandrills live in [[Cameroon]], [[Gabon]] and the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. They live in dense [[rainforest]] and [[coastal]] forests, although they sometimes go onto the [[savannah]].  Mandrills live on the ground and in trees. 
 
 == Behaviour == 
 Mandrills seem to live in large, stable groups called  " hordes " . Hordes often number in the hundreds, possibly averaging around 600+ individuals and reaching as many as 845. < ref > Sabater Pí J. 1972.

''American Journal of Primatology'' '''40''' (4): 297. < /ref >  It is difficult to accurately estimate [[Group size measures|group size]] in the forest, but filming a group crossing a gap between two forest patches or crossing a road is a reliable way of estimating group size. The largest group verifiably observed in this way contained over 1,300 individuals, in [[Lopé National Park]], Gabon—the largest [[swarm|aggregation]] of nonhuman primates ever recorded. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.wcs.org/where-we-work/africa/gabon.aspx | title = Gabon | publisher = Wildlife Conservation Society | accessdate = 4 February 2012}} < /ref >  These groups are made of adult females and their dependent offspring. < ref name= " Abernethy 2002 " > {{cite journal|author=Abernethy KA, White LJT, Wickings EJ|title=Hordes of mandrills (''Mandrillus sphinx'')|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-zoology_2002-09_258/page/131|doi=10.1017/S0952836902001267|year=2002|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=258|pages=131|hdl=1893/21013}} < /ref >   
 
 Males live a solitary lifestyle, and only enter hordes when females are ready for mating, which lasts three months each year.  All-male bachelor groups are not known to exist. < ref name= " Abernethy 2002 " / > < ref > Harrison MJS 2009. The mandrill in Gabon's rain forest-ecology, distribution and status.
