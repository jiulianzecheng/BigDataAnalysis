 '''Audiobooks''' or  " talking books "  are [[book]]s that have been read aloud by someone and recorded. Nowadays, they are usually recorded onto [[compact discs]] (CDs), although some older editions remain on [[Audio cassette|cassette]] tapes. (This is why many texts in this format were first called books-on-tape.) More recently, audiobooks have been available to download from the internet (free or paid-for) and pre-recorded on special [[MP3]] players. 
 
 While audiobooks can be used by anyone, they serve as a main resource for people who are [[blindness|blind]] or cannot see well. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Moore|first=Linda C.|date=2019-09-23|title=Books That Talk to Us|url=https://maculardegeneration.net/caregiver/audiobooks|access-date=2021-05-06|website=MacularDegeneration.net|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Many popular books are often chosen to be turned into audiobooks. The original [[author]] may or may not be involved in choosing the [[Narrator (disambiguation)|narrator]] for the reading. Some authors often use the same reader for many books, so that their audiobooks have a similar sound or style.
