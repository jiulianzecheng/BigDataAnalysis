 '''Bezenye''' is a village in the north-west of [[Hungary]].  It is very close to the border with [[Slovakia]] and only 9 & nbsp;km from the Slovakian [[capital city]] [[Bratislava]]. The [[population]] is about 1600. 
 
 [[Archaeologist]]s  have found things under the ground which show that the first people to lived there were Old [[Germany|Germanic]] [[tribe]]s.  Later, Hungarian (Magyar) people lived there.  Then troops from [[Turkey]] destroyed a lot of the village and the people fled.  New people came to live in the area: [[Croatia]]ns and Germans.  The Croatians called the village  " Bizonja "  and the Germans called it  " Palersdorf " .   " Bezenye "  is the Hungarian name.  It comes from a [[Slavic language|Slav]] word  " baza "  meaning an [[elderberry]] tree. 
 
 After [[World War II]] many of the poorer Germans had to go and live in Germany.  New Hungarian families from Slovakia came to live in Bezenye. 
 
 Today Bezenye is not a typical Hungarian village.  The people speak a mixture of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[German language|German]].  The [[Roman Catholic]] church of the Blessed Virgin Mary has services in Hungarian and Croatian.
