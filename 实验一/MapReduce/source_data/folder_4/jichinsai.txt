 == Jichinsai ceremony in agriculture == 
 [[File:Jitinsai.JPG|right|thumb|240x240px| At a ground-breaking ceremony mainly attended by farmers, banners are often used to show support and encouragement.]] 
 People often pray to the land gods for a bountiful harvest and protection during farming activities. In the beginning of spring, they pray for a successful harvest and safety, while in early autumn, they express gratitude for a good harvest and pray for safety in the upcoming year. This ceremony is usually attended by farmers and is held at a nearby shrine managed by the community or at a location with a rope tied to a rock. 
 
 == Jichinsai ceremony in Buddhism == 
 In Buddhism, there is a practice called jichinho, chintaku ho, anchinho, jitenku, or jimatsuri, which is commonly known as a ground-breaking ceremony. In [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]], there is a ceremony called Chintaku Fudoho where Fudo Myo-o is the principal image. This ceremony is performed before building a hall, a Buddhist [[pagoda]], or a tombstone, where a boundary is formed on the land. The ceremony is centered on the earth and heaven, and involves the heavenly gods and death gods. It is held to prevent hindrance from the dead souls and to requisition them forever. 
 
 When constructing a hall, there is a method called chindanho, where the altar is built without laying a plank. The ground and chindan (altar) are then repaired separately. Sometimes both methods are used simultaneously. A [[kenbo]] containing five treasures and seven treasures is buried in the center of the altar, and a flat stone called chinseki is placed on it. The eight directions are then filled with rings, kui, and five balls. 
 
 In the [[Nichiren Shoshu]] sect, the ground-breaking ceremony is held as a  " construction ceremony "  to purify the land with the power of the principal image and to pray for the safety of the construction. The ceremony involves setting up an altar at the center of the construction site and raising the principal image of the temple that will be built. 
 
 == Steps of Jichinsai == 
 The general flow of Shinto groundbreaking ceremonies is as follows.

 : Before entering the venue of the Shinto ritual, wash your hands with water scooped from the wash basin to purify your mind and body. 
 ; [[Harae]] (修祓)

 ; Koshin (降神) 
 : A ceremony to welcome the gods of the land and the [[Tutelary deity|tutelary gods]] of the region to the shrine set up on the altar. A Shinto priest announces the advent by uttering “Ooo~” (saying “Keihitsu”). 
 ; Kensen (献饌) 
 : A ceremony to have the god eat the offerings of the altar. 
 ; Norito Sojo (祝詞奏上) 
 : Tell the god that you will build a building on that land, and pray for the safety of the subsequent construction. 
 ; Kiyoharai Sanku (清祓・散供) 
 : Purify the four corners of the land and sprinkle rice, salt, and [[hemp]] on them. It is also called Kirinusa or Sanmai.

 ; Withdrawal (撤饌) 
 : Lower your offerings. 
 ; Shoshin (昇神) 
 : Ceremony to send the god who descended to the shrine to the original throne. A closing ceremony will follow. 
 
 == Naorai == 
 After the Shinto groundbreaking ceremony is completed, a [[Naorai]] meeting is usually held. During the Naorai, participants share sacred [[sake]] and enjoy the leftovers from the offerings. In addition to the Shinto ritual, a casual gathering may be arranged where beer, boxed lunches, and other refreshments are provided. Alternatively, participants may rent a banquet hall at a restaurant to celebrate with a feast. 
 
 == Izumo mansion == 
 The [[Izumo-taisha|Izumo Taisha]] holds a special Shinto ritual known as  " {{Nihongo|2=出雲屋敷|3=Izumo Yashiki}} "  to honor the [[Ōkuninushi|Okuninushi]], the supreme deity of the land, and pray for the peace and stability of the land. During this ritual, the 'Goshinto', which is the soil of Izumo Taisha, is buried in the mansion, making it a place ruled by Okuninushi Okami. This is said to eliminate [[demon gates]], attacks, [[azimuths]], and obstacles, leading to prosperity. The traditional rituals of Izumo Taisha are followed, including special features such as three chanting of divine words, burial of sacred soil, and four clapping. After the Izumo mansion, the Izumo annual tribute is offered, and some first fruits are donated every year. < ref > 『出雲大社教布教師養成講習会』発行出雲大社教教務本庁平成元年9月1日全218頁中230頁 < /ref >
