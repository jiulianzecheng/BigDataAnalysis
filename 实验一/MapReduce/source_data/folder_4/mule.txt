 A '''mule''' is a [[Animal|anima]] < nowiki/ > l [[hybrid]] of a [[female]] [[horse]] (a mare) and a [[male]] [[donkey]] (a jack). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mule|title=Mule|publisher=Merriam-Webster Ditionary|accessdate=2007-05-31|archive-date=2012-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315232425/http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mule|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The horse and the donkey are different species, with different numbers of [[Chromosome|chromosomes]]; of the two possible first-generation hybrids between them, the mule is easier to obtain and more common than the [[Hinny (hybrid)|hinny]], which is the offspring of a female donkey (a jenny) and a male horse (a stallion). 
 
 A mule is generally [[sterile]]. Although it is extremely unlikely for a mule to become [[pregnant]] (less than 300 reported cases worldwide), it is possible.   
 
 Mules vary widely in size, from small miniature mules under {{convert|125|cm|-1|abbr=on}} to large and powerful mules standing up to {{convert|180|cm|-1|abbr=on}} at the [[shoulder]]s. The average weight range is between about {{convert|370|and|460|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=2|comma=off}}. 
 
 A mule is generally larger than a donkey and smaller than a horse.  A mule has the long [[ear]]s, thin [[limb]]s, small [[:wikt:hoove|hooves]] and the short [[hair]] of the donkey, while its height, the shape of the [[neck]] and body, and its [[teeth]] are more similar to those of the horse. The [[color]] of its [[coat]] can be any color seen in the horse or in the donkey, which can be white, grey, brown or black. 
 
 They are used mostly for pulling [[cart]]s and [[transportation]]. As [[truck]]s with [[four-wheel drive]] have become common, mules are little used for transport except in places without [[road]]s.
