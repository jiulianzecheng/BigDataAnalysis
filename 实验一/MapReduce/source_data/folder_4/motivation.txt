'''Motivation''' is an important part of [[psychology]]. It is the driving force by which people (or animals) get what they want. A '''motive''' is the reason for an action taken. 
 
 Motivation arouses a person to act towards a desired goal. It is a driving force which promotes action. For example, [[hunger]] is a motivation which causes a desire to eat.  " Motivation is an energizer of behavior " . < ref name=Reber/ >  It is the purpose or psychological cause of an action. < ref name=Schacter/ > 
 
 With animals, motivation is caused by basic needs: needs for food, water, warmth, safety, mating, protecting the young, defending territory, needs to escape pain and threats... The drive to do these things is [[instinct]]ive, [[inborn]], and [[trigger]]ed by circumstance. 
 
 With humans, whose mental life is much more complex, motivation is more complicated. Obviously, humans feel the need for food and water, avoid pain and so on. But they are also capable of having long-term plans which are more difficult to understand. 
 
 == Drives == 
 A drive or desire is ''a deficiency or need that activates behaviour aimed at a goal or an incentive''. < ref name= " Drive/Desire " > {{cite web|title=Drive|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/drive?s=t|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=22 March 2013}} < /ref > < ref > Morgan C.T. 1959. Psychological theory of drive. In Koch, Sigmund (ed) ''Psychology: a study of a science'', vol 1. < /ref > 
 
 Drives may arise inside or outside an organism. External drives for humans are rewards and punishments, and can be quite subtle: a [[wikt:frown|frown]] or a smile may be sufficient for a young person. 
 
 Drives often occur ''within'' the individual and may not need external [[stimuli]] to encourage the behaviour. An example is the sexual drive which is driven by our [[hormone]] system. < ref name=Schacter > Schacter D.L; Gilbert D.L. and Wegner D.M. 2011. ''Psychology'', 2nd ed. New York: Worth. < /ref >  The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. < ref name=Schacter/ >  The process is started by the brain's [[hypothalamus]], which releases pulses of [[GnRH]] (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). This starts a whole chain of reactions which we call  " [[puberty]] " . Longer term, the hormone supporting male sex drive is [[testosterone]], and for women testosterone and [[oestrogen]]. 
 
 By contrast, outside rewards and stimuli are used in training animals by giving them treats when they perform a trick correctly. The treat motivates the animals to perform the trick consistently, even later when the treat is removed from the process. Children are motivated to learn by approval of friendly adults, and by their own pleasure at success. 
 
 == Emotions and unconscious motivation == 
 Motivation and [[emotion]] are intertwined:  " Emotional states tend to have motivational properties " . < ref name=Reber > Reber, Authur S.  &  Emily S. 2001. ''The Penguin dictionary of psychology''. Penguin, p448. {{ISBN|0-140-51451-1}} < /ref > 
 
 Not all motivated behaviour is the result of conscious decisions. [[Freud]]ian psychology suggests that much behaviour is motivated by  " [[unconscious]] factors, working through a network of defence mechanisms, symbolic disguises and psychological cloaks " . < ref name= Reber/ >
