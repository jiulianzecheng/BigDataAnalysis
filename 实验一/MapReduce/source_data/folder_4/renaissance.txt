 '''The Renaissance''' is a period in European history that followed the [[Middle Ages]] and ended in the [[17th century]]. “Renaissance” is a [[French language|French]] word for “cultural rebirth.” During this period, there was a “rebirth” of [[Classical antiquity|classical learning]]. People started relearning the teachings of scholars from [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and other [[Ancient history|ancient]] societies. The Renaissance is often said to be the start of the  " [[Modern history|modern age]] " 
 
 During the Renaissance, there were many advances in [[art]], [[literature]], the [[science]]s, [[mathematics]], and [[culture]]. Many famous [[artist]]s, [[writer]]s, [[philosophy|philosophers]], and [[scientist]]s lived during this period. A person who is clever at a great number of things is sometimes called a  " [[Renaissance man]] " . The most famous Renaissance man is [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who was a [[Painting|painter]], a scientist, a [[musician]] and a philosopher. 
 
 The Renaissance started in [[Italy]], but soon spread across the whole of Europe. In Italy, the period is divided into three parts: 
 * the ''[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/early-renaissance.html Early Renaissance]'' 
 * the ''[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/high-renaissance.html High Renaissance]'' 
 * the ''[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/mannerism1/a/a-beginners-guide-to-mannerism Late Renaissance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420230812/https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/mannerism1/a/a-beginners-guide-to-mannerism |date=2016-04-20 }}  < ref > {{Cite web |title=A beginner's guide to Mannerism  & #124; Mannerism  & #124; Khan Academy |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/mannerism1/a/a-beginners-guide-to-mannerism |access-date=2016-07-26 |archive-date=2016-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420230812/https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/mannerism1/a/a-beginners-guide-to-mannerism |url-status=dead }}'' < /ref > '' (also called the ''Mannerist'' period) 
 
 Following the ''Mannerist'' period was the ''[[Baroque]]'' period, which also spread across Europe starting around 1600. Outside Italy, it can be hard to tell where the ''Renaissance'' period ends and the ''Baroque'' begins. 
 
 == Causes of the Renaissance  == 
 [[File:Press1520.png|thumb|Printers at work in 1520]] 
 === Reading and printing === 
 In the Middle Ages, most artistic, [[Law|legal]], and historical production took place in and around books. [[Monastery|Monasteries]], [[church]]es, [[university|universities]], and people who could afford them produced and owned books. Books were produced entirely by hand, which is why they were called manuscripts; [[illuminated manuscript]]s include hand-colored, drawn, and gilded pictures. 
 
 Most books at that time were written in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and Roman, which was used in the [[Catholic Church]]. Only [[priest]]s and well-educated people read Latin then. People were forbidden by [[law]] from translating the [[Bible]] into [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], French, or other  " local "  [[language]]s. 
 
 Around 1440 the first printed books were made in Europe. The [[printing press]] made it possible to print copies of large books like the [[Bible]] and sell them cheaply. It took 300 calf skins or 100 pig skins to print the Bible. [[printing|Printer]]s soon began to print everything that they thought was interesting: Ancient Greek and Roman [[writing]]s, [[poetry]], and [[Play (theatre)|plays]]; stories about the lives of the [[Canonization|saints]]; [[mathematics]] [[textbook]]s; [[Medicine|medical]] textbooks; Christian [[story|stories]]; [[eroticism|erotic stories]]; books about animals and [[monster]]s; [[map]]s of the world; and [[advice]] to [[prince]]s about how to rule their people. 
 
 Before the invention of the printing press, [[knowledge]] had belonged to priests, monasteries and universities. Suddenly many thousands of people, even [[merchant]]s, could learn far more than they ever could before.

Near it is a church tower from about 1100 in the [[Middle Ages]]. The white front of the church of St. Francesca is from the 1600s. The columns and broken walls are all from Ancient Roman buildings. The circular building to the left is now a church but was an ancient temple.]] 
 
 === Ancient Roman things === 
 From about 400 B.C. to about 400 AD, Europe experienced a [[Golden age|Golden Age]]. In Ancient Greece and Rome, there were many philosophers, writers, [[painter]]s, [[sculptor]]s, [[architect]]s and [[mathematician]]s. Things were beautiful, well-organized and well-run. 
 
 However, by the year 1400, the [[city]] of [[Rome]] was in [[ruins]]. Inside the broken [[wall]]s that had been smashed in 410 AD were the remains of huge [[temple]]s, [[stadium|sports arenas]], [[public baths]], [[apartment]] blocks and [[palace]]s. Nearly all of them were half-buried and ruined, so they could not be used. Many were pulled down to use as building [[stone]]. 
 
 Among the ruins of this once-great city, the people of Rome lived in [[cottage]]s. They still went to church in the huge churches ([[basilica]]s) built by the first Christian [[Emperor]], [[Constantine the Great]], in the [[4th century]]. They still held market day in the Ancient Roman [[market|market place]] of ''Campo dei Fiori'' ( " Field of Flowers " ). 
 
 In 1402, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and a teenage [[Donatello]] came to Rome. They were probably the world's first [[archaeology|archaeologists]]. They were fascinated by everything that they saw. They measured ancient ruined buildings, drew things, and dug around for weeks looking for bits of broken [[statue]]s and painted [[pottery]] that they could put back together. By the time they went back home to [[Florence]], they knew more about Ancient Roman [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]] than anyone had known for about a thousand years. Brunelleschi became a very famous [[architect]] and Donatello became a very famous [[sculpture|sculptor]]. 
 
 === Cash and politics === 
 [[File:FlorenceSkyline.jpg|thumb|300px|The city of Florence. Apart from the dome at San Lorenzo's in the centre of the picture, this view has not changed very much since the 1400s.]] 
 The ''Renaissance'' really began in the city of [[Florence]]. In those days, Italy was not one single [[country]]. It was made of many little [[state]]s, all governed in different ways. These states were constantly making [[alliance]]s and fighting with each other. 
 
 Rome was [[Politics|politically]] powerful, because Rome had the [[Pope]], the person in control of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Because of his very great importance as a spiritual [[leader]], most people and most cities did not want to argue with any pope. After a pope died, a new pope was elected. Everyone who was rich and powerful hoped a member of their family would be chosen. It was always a good idea to have several young men in the family trained as [[priest]]s, just in case. It also helped to be good friends with other rich families. One way to do this was to have lots of daughters and get them to marry rich powerful men from different cities. This was the way that politics worked. 
 
 There were other powerful cities in Italy too. [[Venice]] had a large and powerful [[navy]]. [[Milan]] controlled [[trade]] with [[Northern Europe]] and was very rich. [[Genoa]] was also very rich, because it controlled trade with [[France]] and [[Spain]]. Florence, where many people say the Renaissance started, was another important city. 
 
 Florence’s strength did not come from a strong [[army]], a strong [[fort]]ress, or control over trade. It came from [[finance|banking]]. The [[House of Medici|Medicis]] were an important banking family. They helped to make Florence a powerful city and the centre of Renaissance learning.
