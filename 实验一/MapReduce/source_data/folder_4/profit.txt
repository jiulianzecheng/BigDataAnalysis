'''Profit''' is how much money somebody (normally a [[company]]) makes. This is found by [[subtraction|subtracting]] how much money they have spent (''expenditure'') from how much money they have brought in ([[revenue]]). 
 
 ==An example== 
 If John spends $15 on some [[ice cream]] cones, and then sells them for $20, he has made a profit of $5. This is because he made $20 but when the $15 he used to buy the ice cream cones is subtracted, what is left is $5. In the end, he has $5 more than he had before he bought and sold the ice cream cones.
