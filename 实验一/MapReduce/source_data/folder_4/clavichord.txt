 A '''clavichord''' is a [[musical instrument]] like a small [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. It was very popular for many years, especially in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. 
 
 == Sound == 
 The clavichord is a very quiet instrument. It is not suitable for playing with other instruments because it is so quiet. But it sounds very beautiful in slow, expressive music. It is used as a practice instrument by [[harpsichord]] players, or by organists who wanted to practice at home instead of in a (often very cold) church. They were so small that they could be lifted up and put on a table. They could be put one on top of another so that an organist could practise music written for a two-manual [[Organ (music)|organ]]. Sometimes, they even had [[pedal (music)|pedals]] for organists to practice this skill. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Many [[Germans|German]] composers like [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote music for the “Clavier”. This meant any keyboard instrument: harpsichord, clavichord or organ. The player could choose which they wanted to use. 
 
 When the [[piano]] suddenly became popular – in the 1760s and 1770s – people started to forget about harpsichords and clavichords. Today a few people make harpsichords and clavichords again so that people can play [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]] - the music from when the clavichord was popular.
