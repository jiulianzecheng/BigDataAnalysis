 '''Gnathostomulids''', or '''jaw worms''', are a small phylum of [[Ocean|marine]] [[invertebrates]] which were discovered in 1956. < ref name= " Ax " / >  They are tiny worm-like marine [[animal]]s. They live in [[sand]] and [[mud]] beneath shallow [[coast]]al waters and can survive in relatively [[anoxic]] [[environment]]s.  
 
 ==Anatomy== 
 Most gnathostomulids measure 0.5 to 1 millimetre (0.02 to 0.04 in) in length. They are slender to thread-like worms, with a transparent body. The neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head. < ref name=IZ > {{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 311–312|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}} < /ref >   
 
 Like flatworms they have a [[cilia]]ted [[epidermis]], but are unique in having but one cilium per cell. < ref > Ruppert, E.E. Fox R.S. Barnes R.D. 2004. ''Invertebrate Zoology''. 7th ed, Brooks/Cole-Thomson, Belmont, USA < /ref >  The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also have muscles that allow the body to twist or contract.  
 
 They have no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is very simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region. < ref name=IZ/ > 
 
 The mouth is just behind the head, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of muscular jaws supplied with minute teeth, and a plate on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure which they use to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat. < ref name= Barnes > Barnes R.F.K. et al. 2001. ''The Invertebrates: a synthesis''. Blackwell, Oxford. < /ref >  The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes places; there is no [[anus]]. < ref name=IZ/ >   
 
 === Taxonomy === 
 There are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed. Gnathostomulids have no fossil record. < ref name= Barnes/ > 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Gnathostomulids are [[Hermaphrodite#Simultaneous hermaphrodites|simultaneous hermaphrodites]]. Each individual possesses a single [[ovary]] and one or two [[testis|testes]]. After fertilisation, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage. < ref name=IZ/ >
