 A '''ritual''' (or a '''''rite''''') is a [[ceremony|set of actions]] [[wikt:people|people]] do. In a ritual, the actions are important because every action stands for something. Each ritual of a type is done in a certain way. < ref > Turner, Victor W. 1969. ''The ritual process''. Penguin. < /ref > < ref > Bell, Catherine 1992. ''Ritual theory, ritual practice''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. < /ref >   [[wikt:danger|Danger]] might be involved in carrying out the ritual. When the ritual has been performed successfully, it is often followed by a celebration. 
 
 Rituals can mark a personal change. For example, a [[rite of passage]] may show that a child has reached the [[age of majority]]. All societies seem to have had them. < ref > Padilla, Mark William (editor) 1999. ''Rites of passage in Ancient Greece: literature, religion, society''. Bucknell University Press, 1999.

 A religious rite is a [[religious]] [[ceremony]]. Many rituals have a [[religion|religious]] significance and are part of the religion or traditions of a community. The rite signals that those who take part are [[member]]s of the religion, or [[belief|believers]] in the religion. The rite may signal [[status]], [[qualification]], [[prayer]] and [[promise|commitment]] to the god or to the [[belief]]. 
 
 A [[rite]] need not be to a religion as understood in the present day. Fervent support of a sports team, or kissing the ring of an [[organised crime]] lord, or a [[military |military enrollment]] is equally a [[ritual|rite]], because it has consequences for the behaviour of the person, and for their [[belief]]s. < ref > Hall, Richard Andrew 2007. ''The world of the Vikings''. Thames  &  Hudson. ISBN 978-0500051443 < /ref > < ref > McNab, Chris 2013. ''Hitler's elite: the SS 1939â€“45''. Osprey. ISBN 978-1782000884 < /ref > 
 
 A ritual can also be linked to [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], when a person believes that performing the ritual again and again is necessary.
