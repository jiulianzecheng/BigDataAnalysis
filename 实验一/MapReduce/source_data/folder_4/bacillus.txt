 '''''Bacillus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[rod shaped]] [[bacteria]]. They are [[Gram-positive]], meaning they have an extra outside cell layer. 
 
 Bacilli are partly or wholly [[aerobic]]. They do [[aerobic respiration]]. They are every where in nature. ''Bacillus'' includes both free-living (non-parasitic) and [[parasitic]] [[pathogen]]ic species. < ref > Turnbull P.C.B. 1996. Bacillus. In: Baron S. ''et al'' (eds) ''Barron's medical microbiology''. 4th ed, Univ of Texas Medical Branch. {{ISBN|978-0-9631172-1-2}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7699/] < /ref > 
 
 Under stressful conditions, they produce endospores. These are not true spores, but like survival pods they can stay in a dormant state for long periods. 
 
 Some species of ''Bacillus'' are worth noting: 
 
 *''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', which causes [[Anthrax (disease)|Anthrax]]. 
 *''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' is considered an [[model organism]]. It is often used in [[genetic engineering]]. < ref > Graumann P (ed) 2012. ''Bacillus: cellular and molecular biology''. 2nd ed, Caister Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-904455-97-4}} [http://www.horizonpress.com/bacillus] < /ref > 
 *''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' which is responsible for a form of [[food poisoning]]. 
 *''[[Bacillus thuringensis]]'' which is used in pest control. It produces a [[toxin]] which can kill some [[moth]]s, and certain [[butterfly|butterflies]].
