'''Thelarche''' means the [[wikt:development|development]] of [[breast]]s in [[human]] [[female]]s during [[puberty]] (sexual development). < ref > Merriam Webster defintion http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/thelarche < /ref > 
 
 ==Development== 
 Generally, the left breast is the larger of the two. < ref > Loughry C.W. ''et al'' 1987. Right and left breast volume and volume distribution comparisons in normal and tumor-containing breasts. ''Cancer Detect Prev'', '''10'''(3-4):215-21. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3568018] < /ref >   
 This usually begins when girls are about 9. < ref > Olson, Ginny Teenage Girls: Exploring Issues Adolescent Girls Face and Strategies to help them https://books.google.com/books?id=miQ5iJnXDKkC & pg=PT30 & dq=girls+breasts+start+growing+10+years < /ref >  A lump that is a bit hard appears in each breast under the areola, which is the dark ring around the nipple. The lump in one breast may grow before the other one. < ref name= " Marshall 187 " > Marshall, ''Human Growth'', p. 187. < /ref >  This is called breast budding. < ref name= " Byers 27 " > {{cite book|author=Anne Byers|chapter=How do Girls' Bodies Change during Puberty?|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Puberty|url=https://archive.org/details/frequentlyaskedq0000byer|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=Rosen Publishing|year=2007|pages=[https://archive.org/details/frequentlyaskedq0000byer/page/26 26]â€“33 at 27|isbn=978-1-4042-0966-4}}. < /ref >  Within 6-12 months, both breasts will have started growing. The swelling can be felt and seen outside the edges of the areolae. About 1 and a half to 2 years after the breasts first start growing, they are close to the shape and size of an adult woman's breasts. The nipple and areola may be on a smaller mound on each breast. This small mound usually goes away when each breast is fully grown. < ref name= " Marshall 188 " > Marshall, ''Human Growth'', p. 188. < /ref >  Breast size depends on the body's amount of fat. < ref name= " Byers 27 " / > < ref > See also {{cite web|title=Normal breast development|url=http://www.007b.com/breast_development.php|publisher=007 Breasts|accessdate=2 May 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Thelarchic stage== 
 It is the Tanner 2 stage of breast development (a scale used to analyze changes in people from childhood to adulthood). The first stage is the non-developed prepubescent state of breasts. Thelarche is usually the first sign of puberty. It usually occurs after age 8, and is the first evidence of puberty in 60% of women. It usually ends at age 13. < ref > ''Glass' Office Gynecology'', edited by Robert Glass ''et al'', page 15. < /ref >  However, it can sometimes happen earlier. When this happens, it can be by itself (called isolated premature thelarche). < ref > Isolated Premature Thelarche http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/isolated-premature-thelarche/ < /ref >  It could also be a wider pattern of precocious puberty (sexual development happening too early).  
 
 ==Hormones== 
 The process is started by [[estradiol]], the primary female [[sex]] [[hormone]]. Many young women are not prepared for thelarche, and this may result in [[Stress (biology)|stress]]. < ref > Golub, Sharon (ed) 1983. ''Menarche: the transition from girl to woman''. Lexington Books, Toronto. < /ref >  [[Teaching]] materials on breast development for [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[middle school]]s has been suggested to promote breast health by reducing [[shame]]. < ref > Sex Hysteria. https://sexhysteria.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/breast-shame-tradition-deception-and-the-money-trail/ < /ref >
