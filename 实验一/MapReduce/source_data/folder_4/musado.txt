The '''musado''' is a modern [[martial art]] which is divided into two branches: the '''traditional musado''' destined for civil persons and the '''Musado MCS''' (''Military Combat System'') destined for the army and the police. The term ''musado'' (from [[Korean language]]) means  " the way of warrior " . Nevertheless, the musado is a German martial art, based on the Korean arts. 
 
 The international centre of the musado is in [[Dortmund]].

Many of the techniques tailored more for European physical capabilities while maintaining the Korean martial arts mindset  < ref > {{cite web|url=https://tm.musadocz.cz/historie-musado/|title=KDO BYL HERBERT GRUDZENSKI? - MUSADO CZ – Tradiční styl|website=tm.musadocz.cz|access-date=2019-02-14|archive-date=2020-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805161024/https://tm.musadocz.cz/historie-musado/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  though Grudzenski himself was also a black belt in Judo  &  Jujitsu. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mpcs-musado.de/?page_id=319|title=WMA - Verband|date=5 May 2014|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 
 The beginning of the musado is dated as from 1968. 
 
 == Technical levels in the traditional musado == 
 The traditional musado has 6 levels (1.-6. ''kup'') of student which are marked by colour (see the table). Differently from the majority of the [[martial art]]s the student does not have a belt since the beginning. Only to the term of the course which lasts 2–4 months there is capacity to pass examination for the white belt.

 == Musado Military Combat System == 
 The '''Musado MCS''' is a military system of personal defence and of body-to-body combat, designed especially for training of the army, of the police and of other forces of security. 
 
 The musado also is used in training of the special units, for example of the units of aerial war, of the brigades of rapid reaction and of the brigades of the [[United Nations Organization|UNO]]. 
 
 In the [[army]] of the Czech Republic this system was introduced in 1993. 
 
 '''Musado MCS''' does not have any rules precisely given. However, with its vast extension it provides more than 4000 techniques and skills which with good mastery enable the warrior to stop an attack.
