 '''Univisión''' is one of the largest [[Hispanic]] [[television]] channels in the [[United States]].{{fact|date=January 2012}} 
 
 It was founded by the largest media company in Mexico (now known as Grupo Televisa) as a means to spread Spanish programming in the United States. Univision has grown to be the largest Spanish-language media outlet in the U.S.{{fact|date=January 2012}}  Its daily news program ''Noticiero Univisión'', co-anchored by [[Jorge Ramos]] and [[María Elena Salinas]], has in several occasions outdone (in number of ratings) major English-language network evening news programming such as [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s World News Tonight{{fact|date=January 2012}}. 
 
 Univisión and [[Telemundo]] USA have been competing for the top spot among Hispanic viewers for many years, often imitating each other's programming. 
 
 Univisión headquarters are based in [[Los Angeles]], although much of its programming is filmed in [[Miami]]. Among its shows are ''El Show De Cristina'' (talkshow hosted by [[Cristina Saralegui]]), [[Don Francisco]]'s ''[[Sábado Gigante]]'', ''Despierta América'' (morning show), ''Primer Impacto'' (newsmagazine), ''Aquí y Ahora'' (premier investigative nightly newsmagazine),  and ''Noticiero Univisión'' (news program conducted by [[Jorge Ramos]] and [[Maria Elena Salinas]]). 
 
 In 2013, Univision and [[ABC News]] announced that they were to become partners and will form a new channel called Fusion. Fusion will show English news for Hispanic audiences. The channel began broadcasting on October 28, 2013.
