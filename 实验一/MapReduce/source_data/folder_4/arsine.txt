'''Arsine''', also known as '''arsenic hydride''' or '''hydrogen arsenide''', is a [[chemical compound]]. Its chemical formula is AsH < sub > 3 < /sub > . It has [[hydrogen]] and [[arsenide]] [[ion]]s in it. The hydrogen is in its +1 [[oxidation state]]. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 Arsine is a colorless gas. It is a [[reducing agent]]. It has a weak garlic odor. It easily burns to make [[arsenic trioxide]] in excess air or [[arsenic]] in small amounts of air. It breaks down to [[arsenic]] and hydrogen when heated. It can dissolve in water. It is heavier than air. Arsine reacts violently with [[oxidizing agent]]s, such as the [[halogen]]s. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 Arsine is made by reacting any arsenic(III) compound with any [[hydride]]. It can also be made by reacting any [[arsenide]] with an [[acid]]. It was first made by reacting [[zinc]], [[hydrochloric acid]], and arsenic trioxide. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Arsine is used to make [[semiconductor]]s like [[gallium arsenide]]. It was looked at as a [[chemical weapon]]. It is almost odorless (it kills before one smells it), heavy (spreads along the ground), and colorless. It was unstable though, easily igniting. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 Arsine is extremely toxic. 0.00005% (0.5 ppm) can poison people; 0.025% (250 ppm) quickly kills people.
