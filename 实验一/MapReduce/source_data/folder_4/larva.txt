 Many animals develop in separate stages. A '''larva''' (plural: ''larvae'') develops from the [[egg (biology)|egg]] in those [[animal]]s. It is a separate life stage from the [[adult]] reproductive stage. A larva does not look like the [[adult]] animal, and changes shape (known as [[metamorphosis]]) as it grows up. There may be several larval stages before the adult form. [[Tadpole]]s, [[maggot]]s and [[caterpillar]]s are larvae. 
 
 [[Ocean|Marine]] organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of [[ovum|eggs]] and [[sperm]]s into the water column. After [[fertilisation]], the eggs develop into tiny larvae. The larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults. Most marine [[invertebrates]] and many [[fish]] have a [[pelagic]] larval stage or pelagic eggs. These live in the [[plankton]], and may be transported long distances. 
 
 == Evolutionary theory == 
 Probably the most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of larval stages is the need for ''dispersal''. [[Sessile]] organisms such as [[barnacle]]s and tunicates, and sea-floor groups like [[mussel]]s and [[crab]]s, need some way to move their young into new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have relatively long pelagic larval stages (how long a larva is in the water column). < ref >  Brothers E.B., D.M. Williams, and P.F. Sale. 1983. Length of larval life n twelve families of fishes at “One Tree Lagoon,” Great Barrier Reef, Australia. ''Marine Biol''. '''76''': 319-324. < /ref > < ref >  Scheltema R.S. 1986. On dispersal and planktonic larvae of [[benthos|benthic]] invertebrates: an eclectic overview and summary of problems. ''Bull. Mar. Sci''. '''39''': 290-322. < /ref >  During this time, larvae feed and grow, and many species move through several stages of development. For example, most barnacles [[moult]] through six ''[[nauplius]]'' larva stages before moulting to a ''[[cipris]]'', when they look to settle. The larvae eat different food from the adults, and disperse. 
 
 The other consideration is the small size of the eggs. If animals lay many small eggs (and most do), then the young stages cannot live the life the adults lead. They must live a separate life until they have the size and capability to live as an adult. This is what the larvae do. 
 
 === Origin of vertebrates === 
 A long-standing theory is that in transformed larvae of [[Sea squirt|sea-squirt]]s ([[tunicate]]s) lies the origin of vertebrates. Tunicates are sessile, but their larvae are mobile, and have some features found in early vertebrates. The process of [[paedomorphosis]], where [[juvenile]] features are retained in the adult, is the proposed mechanism. < ref > Garstang, Walter 1894.
