 '''Baguettes''' are long thin [[Wikt:loaf|loaves]] of [[bread]] popular in [[France]], but now common in many other countries. Usually, they are made of white bread. Baguettes usually have a hard [[crust]] on the outside but soft bread on the inside. 
 
 French traditions say that bread may only contain the following four things: [[flour]], [[water]], [[yeast]] and [[salt]]. Anything containing more than those things must not be called bread. 
 
 A baguette is about 5-6 cm wide, 3 to 4 cm high, and about 65 cm long. Such a baguette usually weighs about 250 grams. < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.answers.com/topic/baguette |title=baguette: Definition from Answers.com |work=answers.com |access-date=1 May 2010}} < /ref >  It is common to dip the bread into olive oil when it is eaten. 
 
 == History == 
 The baguette is thought as to have come from France, but it actually came from [[Vienna]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url= http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodbreads.html |title=Food timeline: history of bread |work=Lynne Olver 1999 |access-date=16 July 2010}} < /ref >  In the middle of the nineteenth century, steam ovens had just been brought into use. This allowed loaves to be made with a crispy crust and the white centre, similar to today's baguettes. < ref name= " france " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.francethisway.com/frenchbread.php |title=French bread and french baguette - food from france |work=francethisway.com |access-date=1 May 2010 |archive-date=3 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503090655/http://www.francethisway.com/frenchbread.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 
 Later, in 1920, a law was passed that did not let bakers work before 4am. This made it impossible to make a larger loaf in time for their customers' breakfasts. The longer, thinner baguette helped solve this problem because it could be prepared and baked much faster. < ref name= " france " / >  However, since the French had been making long thin loaves for a long time, what exactly was invented in 1920? It seems to be just the use of the word  " baguette "   for those thin loaves. 
 
 == Description == 
 Outside France, the baguette is also called a 'French stick'. It is a loaf of bread, up to a metre long but only about four to five centimetres in diameter. The baguette is a symbol of France. 
 
 Baguettes are eaten as a [[sandwich]] cut in half lengthwise. They are also eaten for breakfast (usually with jam or chocolate spread). 
 
 A loaf the same length as a baguette but thicker (about 8-10 centimetres diameter) is known as 'pain'. A thin version of the baguette is called 'ficelle'.  
 
 Even in France there is a difference between a traditional baguette and a 'supermarket' baguette. 
 
 Baguette has the same texture as the Greek bread Tsoureki. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.greekboston.com/cooking/bread/ | title=No Meal is Complete Without Greek Bread! | date=26 June 2015 }} < /ref >
