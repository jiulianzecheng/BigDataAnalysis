 [[File:Brumby.jpg|thumb|Where brumbies are found in Australia]] 
 A '''brumby''' is a [[Feral organism|feral]] [[horse]] in Australia. They are found in many areas around the country, but the best-known brumbies are found in the [[Australian Alps]] region in south-eastern Australia. Today, most of them are found in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]]. A group of Brumbies is known as a  " mob "  or  " band " .   
 
 Brumbies are the [[wikt:descendant|descendants]] of horses that escaped or were lost many years ago. In some cases, they descend from the horses that belonged to the early European settlers. They had brought horses from South Africa, Indonesia, Great Britain, as well as many [[thoroughbred]]s and [[Arabian horse|Arabians]]. 
 
 Today brumbies live in many places, including some [[national park]]s. Sometimes they are captured and [[Domestication|domesticated]]. Most are then used as working horses on [[farm]]s or [[Station (agriculture)|stations]]. Some may be used as [[Horse riding|riding horses]] or [[horse show|show horses]]. < ref > Dobbie, W. R., Berman, D. M.,  &  Braysher, M. L. (1993). ''Managing Vertebrate Pests: Feral horses''. Canberra: Australia Government Publishing Service. < /ref > 
 
 Brumbies are regarded as [[Pest (biology)|pests]] by [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] and the [[Government of Australia|government]]. They are considered a threat to native [[ecosystem]]s. < ref > {{cite news |title=Guns cocked as brumbies run wild|first=Malcolm|last=Holland|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/guns-cocked-as-brumbies-run-wild/story-e6frf7jo-1225841125272 |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=15 March 2010 |access-date=20 December 2010}} < /ref >  There are several programmes to eradicate (kill) all feral horses across Australia. < ref > {{cite book |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/KNPHorseManagementPlanFinal08.pdf|title=Kosciuszko National Park Horse Management Plan|date=December 2008|publisher=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Department of Environment and Climate Change, NSW Government|access-date=11 January 2010|isbn= 978-1-74122-831-1}} < /ref >  However, there are also many people working to stop this, as brumbies are also valued by many as part of Australia's [[history]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.guyfawkesheritagehorse.com/|title=The Guy Fawkes Heritage Horse Association Inc.|last=Foster|first=Helen and Digby|year=2010|publisher=self|access-date=4 January 2010|location=Dorrigo, NSW}} < /ref >  The Brumby also might get its name from James Brumby, a horse breeder.
