A '''clause''' is a part of a [[sentence]]. Each clause is made up of a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (who or what the sentence is about) and a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (what happens in a sentence). Each predicate has only one main [[verb]]. ''I love you'' is a sentence which has only one clause. ''I love you and I will always love you'' is a sentence which has two clauses. The two clauses are ''I love you'' and ''I will always love you''. These clauses are joined together by the word ''and'', which is a [[conjunction]]. Clauses may be independent or dependent. 
 
 == In use == 
 Two clauses can be joined with a [[pronoun]]. For example: ''I live in London, which is in England''. Here, ''I live in London'' is the first clause, and ''which is in England'' is the second clause. The word ''which'' is a pronoun which takes the place of ''London''. It joins the two clauses. A sentence can contain many clauses. But sentences with fewer clauses are easier to understand. 
 
 == Dependent and independent clauses == 
 A [[simple sentence]] may also be called an [[independent clause]]. It may be a part of a [[Sentence|compound]] or [[complex sentence]], but it can also stand on its own as a simple sentence (or independent clause). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www2.ivcc.edu/rambo/eng1001/sentences.htm |title=Sentences: Simple, Compound, and Complex |author=Randy Rambo |date=2012 |website= |publisher=English Composition 1 |accessdate=27 December 2015 |archive-date=26 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226102435/http://www2.ivcc.edu/rambo/eng1001/sentences.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 A '''subordinate clause''' also called a '''dependent clause''' is one which cannot stand by itself. < ref name=GM > {{cite web |url=http://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/subordinate_clause.htm |title=What Is a Subordinate Clause? (with Examples) |author= |website= |publisher=Grammar Monster |accessdate=27 December 2015}} < /ref >  This is because it does not express a complete thought. < ref name=GM/ >  It contains both a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and a [[verb]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/subordinateclause.htm |title=The Subordinate Clause |author=Robin L. Simmons |date=1997 |website= |publisher=Grammar Bytes |accessdate=27 December 2015}} < /ref >  A subordinate clause always depends on a main clause. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/clauses |title=Clauses |author= |website= |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=27 December 2015 |archive-date=3 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103104731/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/clauses |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The main clause is almost always an independent clause, therefore the main clause by itself makes sense and can stand on its own. However, the subordinate clause does not. For [[example]], ''I love you'' makes perfect sense left on its own. However, ''and always will'', does not. The only time a sentence can be made up of only dependent clauses is when they are joined by [[Conjunction|correlative conjunctions]]: conjunction pairs like  " either/or " ,  " neither/nor " , and  " not only/but also " .
