'''Proprioception''' is the [[sense]] that people have of knowing where the parts of their body are.  It is also called '''kinesthetic sense'''. < !--per the sense DAB page-- > 
 
 Proprioception is used when a person touches the tip of their [[nose]] while keeping their [[eye]]s closed.  Even though they cannot see their finger or their nose, they can sense how to touch them together.
