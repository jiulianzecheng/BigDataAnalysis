 '''Mouthparts''' is a general term used in animal biology ([[zoology]]). It means the various bits and pieces around the opening of the [[alimentary canal]] (mouth). These mouthparts are used by animals to help get their food organised before they swallow it. 
 
 All animals have mouthparts except those which [[absorption|absorb]] their food through their [[epidermis]]. The main variations are [[wikt:chew|chewing]], [[wikt:suck|sucking]] and [[dissolve|dissolving]]
