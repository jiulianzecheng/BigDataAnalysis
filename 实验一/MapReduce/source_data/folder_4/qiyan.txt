{{Slavery}} 
 '''{{transliteration|ar|Qiyān}}''' ({{lang-ar|قِيان}}, {{IPA-ar|qi'jæːn|lang}}; singular '''{{transliteration|ar|qayna}}''', {{lang-ar|قَينة}}, {{IPA-ar|'qɑjnæh|lang}}) were a social class of women which existed in the pre-modern [[Islamic]] world. They were trained as [[Entertainer|entertainers]]. The term was used for both slaves, and free women who had this role. Some of these women came from the nobility.{{sfn|Reynolds|2017|p=79-80}}  The {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} flourished under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and in [[Al-Andalus]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Schlein|first=Deborah Joanne|title=The Talent and The Intellect: The Qayna's Application of Skill in the Umayyad and 'Abbasid Royal Courts|url=https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/5h73pw11p?locale=it|website=etd.library.emory.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 Very often the word is translated as 'singing girls' or 'singing slave girls'. There were also older Quiyan. They were skilled entertainers, and their skills were more than singing; it included for example [[dancing]], < ref > {{cite web|last=Prince-Eichner|first=Simone|date=27 April 2016|title=Embodying the Empire: Singing Slave Girls in Medieval Islamicate Historiography|url=https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cclura_2016/2|access-date=24 August 2023|website=Scholarship @ Claremont}} < /ref >  [[composing]] music and verse, reciting historical or literary [[anecdotes]] ({{transliteration|ar|akhbar}}), [[calligraphy]], or shadow-puppetry.

 Some sources see quiyan as a subset of jawāri, female slaves, or even more specific, slave girls. Sometimes, qiyan are called  slave-girl poets. Many {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} were free women.{{sfn|Caswell|2011|p=191}} One of them was even [[Ulayya bint al-Mahdi|an Abbasid princess]]. 
 
 The word comes from the female form of [[blacksmith]], craftsman. The term was used for manual labourers, anyone paid to do work. Later, it referred to people doing an artistic performance for a reward. From here, its feminine form came to have the meaning of a female performer of various arts, in a specific role.{{sfn|Caswell|2011|p=2}} 
 
 Like other slaves in the Islamic world, {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} were legally sexually available to their owners. They were often associated in literature with [[licentiousness]], and sexuality was an important part of their appeal, but they do not seem to have been [[prostitutes]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 There were also common {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} who performed for the public in common {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}}-houses, and these houses were in some cases [[Brothel|brothels]].{{sfn|Caswell|2011}} 
 
 It is not clear how early the institution of the {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} emerged, but {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} certainly flourished during the ‘Abbasid period. < ref > Kristina Richardson, '[https://www.academia.edu/661365 Singing Slave Girls (''qiyan'') of the 'Abbasid Court in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries]', in ''Children in Slavery Through the Ages'', ed. by Gwyn Campbell, Suzanne Miers, and Joseph C. Miller (Athens: Ohio University Press, 2009), 105-18. < /ref > {{sfn|Caswell|2011}} 
 
 Often, slave girls that were not that beautifuil were made Qiyan; often they also had a darker skin. It is not certain that these claims were accurate.{{sfn|Reynolds|2017|p=102-3}} One social phenomenon that can be seen as a successor to the {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} is the Egyptian {{transliteration|arz|[[almah (Egyptian dancer)|almah]]}}, [[Courtesan|courtesans]] or female entertainers in [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Medieval Egypt]], educated to sing and recite classical [[poetry]] and to discourse wittily. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InjIw3lWQTUC & pg=PA29|title=Dancing Fear and Desire: Race, Sexuality, and Imperial Politics in Middle Eastern Dance|author=Stavros Stavrou Karayanni|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-88920-926-8|pages=28–29}} < /ref > 
 
 There are many stories about qiyan, especially of female slaves. For this reason, they are important in the history of slavery in the Islamic world. Many female poets of the Arab world in the Middle ages were qiyan. For a few {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}}, it is possible to give quite a full biography.{{sfn|Reynolds|2017|p=100-101}} Important medieval sources of {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} include a [[treatise]] by [[al-Jahiz]] (776–868/869 CE), [[Abu Tayyib al-Washsha]]'s {{transliteration|ar|Kitāb al-Muwashshà}} ({{lang|ar|كتاب الموشى} The Brocaded Book), and anecdotes included in sources such as the {{transliteration|ar|[[Kitab al-Aghani]]}} Book of Songs) and {{transliteration|ar|al-Imāʼ al-Shawāʼir}} (The Slave Poetesses) by [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani]] (897–967 CE), {{transliteration|ar|Nisāʼ al-Khulafā}} (The Consorts of the Caliphs}}) by [[Ibn al-Sa'i|ibn al-Sāʿī]], and {{transliteration|ar|al-Mustazraf min Akhbar al-Jawari}} (Choice Anecdotes from the Accounts of Concubines) by [[al-Suyuti]] ({{c.|1445–1505 CE}}).{{sfn|Reynolds|2017|p=101}} Many of these sources recount the [[repartee]] of prominent {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}}, though there are hints that {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} in less wealthy households were used by their owners to attract gifts.{{sfn|Reynolds|2017|p=103-4}} In the 'Abbasid period, {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} were often educated in the cities of [[Basra]], [[Ta'if]], and [[Medina]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 It has been suggested that  " the [[geisha]] of Japan are perhaps the most comparable form of socially institutionalized female companionship and entertainment for [men] " , but there are also many differences.{{sfn|Reynolds|2017|p=100-21}} < ref > Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'Qiyān' in the Early Abbasid Era'' (London: I. B. Tauris, 2011), p. 1. < /ref > 
 
 == Decline == 
 The institution of {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} declined with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Caswell|2011|p=258–259}} When it first broke apart, this did not have a direct impact. The {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} did not take sides in political disputes.{{sfn|Caswell|2011|p=261}} However, political instability led to [[tax]] mismanagement.{{sfn|Caswell|2011|p=263–264}} Also, the new class of Turkish soldiers wanted to be paid more. This meant there was less money in the treasury. It also meant that  artistic activity could not be funded < !--, so the artists were not as successful as they had been-- > .{{sfn|Caswell|2011|p=264–265}} 
 
 Citizens who used the services of qiyān, were thought to be rich. Soldiers also asked citizens for money, who they thought would be rich. This made [[wikt:ostentatious|ostentatious]] behavior risky.{{sfn|Caswell|2011|p=264–265}} 
 == Al-Andalus == 
 It seems that for the first century or so in [[al-Andalus]], {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} were brought west after being trained in [[Medina]] or [[Baghdad]]. They might also have been trained by artists from the east. In the 11th century the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] collapsed. At that time, {{transliteration|ar|qiyān}} were often trained in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rather than imported after training. It seems that while female singers still existed, enslaved ones were no longer found in al-Andalus in the 14th century CE.{{sfn|Reynolds|2017|p=100–121}}
