 A '''plantation''' is a large [[farm]] which is usually specialized on farming one type of [[crop]].  Plantations grow [[cash crop]]s, mostly for [[export]], and less for local use. Crops grown on plantations include [[banana]], [[sugarcane]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]].  
 
 Some of the problems with plantations come from the fact that most are [[monoculture]]s, that is there is only one kind of crop that is grown there. This makes them vulnerable to [[pest]]s, for example. 
 Among the earliest examples of plantations were the [[latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. They produced large quantities of [[wine]] and [[olive oil]] for export.  
 
 Plantation [[agriculture]] grew rapidly in the [[early modern period]] with the increase in [[international trade]] and the relative decline of [[subsistence farming]]. Like every [[economics|economic activity]], it has changed over time. Earlier forms of plantation agriculture were associated with large disparities of [[wealth]] and [[income]], foreign ownership and political influence, and exploitative social systems such as [[Indentured servant|indentured labor]] and [[slavery]], especially with the [[southern American plantations]].
