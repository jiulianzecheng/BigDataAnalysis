'''Licchavi''' (also ''Lichchhavi'', ''Lichavi'') was an [[ancient history|ancient]] [[republic]] that existed in what is now [[Bihar]] state of [[India]] before the birth of [[Mahavira]] (b. 599 BC). < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/eb/article-9048151/Licchavi |title= " Licchavi " , ''Encyclopedia Britannica Online'' |access-date=2007-11-18 |archive-date=2008-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223185727/http://p2.www.britannica.com/eb/article-9048151/Licchavi |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074639/Vaisali |title= " Vaisali " , ''Encyclopedia Britannica Online'' |access-date=2007-11-18 |archive-date=2008-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223225431/http://p2.www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074639/Vaisali |url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Its capital was [[Vaishali]]. 
 
 From about 400 to 750, a kingdom in [[Nepal]] in the [[Kathmandu]] Valley had the same name, Licchavi. 
 
 ==Origins== 
 Early [[Buddhist]] legends tell that Licchavi was a ruling family during [[Gautama Buddha]]'s time in [[India]], but links to the Nepalese kingdom are speculative.  The language of Licchavi inscriptions is [[Sanskrit]], and the particular script used is closely related to official [[Gupta]] scripts. That means that [[India]] was a significant cultural influence. That was likely through [[Mithila]], now the north of [[Bihar]], India.
