 The '''lily''' is a [[genus]] of [[flower]]ing [[plant]]. There are many [[species]] of lilies, like trumpet lilies and tiger lilies. They are usually quite tall, and are [[perennial]]s. 
 
 Most lilies grow from a [[bulb]], which in some species develops into a [[rhizome]], which carries small bulbs.  A highly efficient technique for multiple shoot and propagule formation in lilies through plant tissue culture technique was given by Yadav et al., in 2013 < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Yadav|first1=Rakesh|last2=Yadav|first2=Neha|last3=Pal|first3=Minakshi|last4=Goutam|first4=Umesh|date=2013-12-01|title=Multiple shoot proliferation, bulblet induction and evaluation of genetic stability in Asiatic hybrid lily (Lilium sp.)|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40502-014-0060-4|journal=Indian Journal of Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=354–359|doi=10.1007/s40502-014-0060-4|s2cid=256393829 |issn=0974-0252}} < /ref >   
 
 Lilies grow in [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[Asia]]. There are more than 100 species, and many cultivated [[variety (botany)|varieties]]. They also come in various colours. It tends to grow wild in the [[forest]] and a grassy plain of a mountainous area, but several kinds grow wild on wet ground. A lily's petals come in multiples of three. The [[fleur de lys]] is a stylized depiction of the lily.
