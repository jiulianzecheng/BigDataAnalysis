 '''Ferry''' is a [[boat]] or [[ship]] that is used to take people, vehicles or goods across large bodies of [[water]], such as [[sea|seas]], [[lake|lakes]] and [[river|rivers]].  
 
 In many places around the world, ferries are very important for [[public transport]]. Some of these places can only be reached by ferry, because they have no [[road|roads]] or [[railway|railways]] with [[bridge]] or [[tunnel|tunnels]] that join them to nearby places, nor do they have any locations at which to land [[airplane|airplanes]], whether it is an [[airport]] or only an [[airfield]]. 
 
 Sometimes the trip in a ferry is free and sometimes it must be paid for. Many ferries also carry cars, some even have own [[railway track|rail tracks]], allowing the ferry to carry [[train|trains]] on board. 
 
 The word 'ferry' can also mean 'to take someone or something by ferry'. 
 
 The Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, in which 193 people died near [[Bruges|Zeebrugge]] in 1987, was one of the worst ferry accidents of recent times. It was caused by a crew member forgetting to close the bow doors of the ferry.
