 A '''still''' is a tool used to clean a [[liquid]]. It does this by first [[boiling]] the liquid and turning it into a [[gas]]. This gas is then cooled, changing it back into liquid. Stills get their name from the word di''still''ation. [[Distillation]] is the process of boiling and cooling a liquid to purify it. Stills are most often used to create [[alcohol]], but they can also be used with any liquid. Some examples are [[medicine]]s and [[perfume]]s. 
 
 There are two main types of stills: pot stills and reflux stills. In a pot still, the pot (like a large kettle) holding the liquid is heated. The hot gas is cooled in a simple neck, or tube, and collected. < ref > {{Cite web

  }} < /ref >  Pot stills are used for making alcohol like whisky. A reflux still is much more complex. It works with a continual flow of liquid going into the boiler, and a continual flow of distilled liquid coming out. The distilled liquid can also be put through the process several times, which is why it is called a reflux still. This allows for a more pure product, and the person working the still can control the level of purity. < ref > {{Cite web
