'''Supersymmetry''' is a [[scientific theory]] that says that when [[elementary particle]]s (such as [[photon]]s, [[electron]]s, and [[quark]]s) were formed at the beginning of the [[universe]], matching kinds of [[Theoretical Particle|theoretical]]  " superparticles "  were also created. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://hitoshi.berkeley.edu/public_html/susy/susy.html |title=Introduction to Supersymmetry |last=Murayama |first=Hitoshi |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |access-date=2015-04-02 |archive-date=2010-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628115048/http://hitoshi.berkeley.edu/public_html/susy/susy.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  If this theory is true, it would at least double the kinds of particles in the universe. If the universe has extra [[dimensions]] (M-Theory by Edward Witten predicts up to 11) then there would also be more ways to have [[symmetry]] and more kinds of superparticles. 
 
 Many [[scientist]]s hope to prove supersymmetry because it fills many gaps in the [[Standard Model]] of physics (including [[dark matter]]) and would give support to the ideas of [[string theory]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/supersymmetry-is-a-big-deal-for-physics-2015-3 |title=Here's how proving supersymmetry could completely change how we understand the universe |last=Dickerson |first=Kelly |date=2015-03-19 |publisher=Business Insider}} < /ref >  However, experiments in the [[Large Hadron Collider]] have not found evidence of supersymmetry so far. 
 
 Supersymmetry was the idea of Hironari Miyazawa (b. 1927). < ref > {{Cite journal
