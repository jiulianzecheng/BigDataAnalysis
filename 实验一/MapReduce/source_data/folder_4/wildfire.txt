 Wildfires occur in every continent except [[Antarctica]]. They can occur naturally and spontaneously, but many are caused by humans, accidentally or deliberately. Fossil records and human history show that wildfires do occur at intervals. < ref name=NOVA > {{cite web |author= Pyne, Stephen J. |date= 2002 |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/plants.html |title= How plants use fire (and are used by it) |work= NOVA online |access-date= 2009-06-30}} < /ref > < ref name=Krock > {{cite web |last= Krock |first=Lexi |title= The World on Fire |publisher= NOVA online - Public Broadcasting System (PBS) |access-date=2009-07-13 |date= June 2002 |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html }} < /ref >  The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] and the spread of land plants made Earth a planet of fire. 
 
 Wildfires can cause extensive damage to property and human life, but they also have some beneficial effects on wilderness areas. Some plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction, < ref name=NOVA / >  although large wildfires may also have negative ecological effects. < ref name=UToronto > {{cite journal |url= https://www.firelab.utoronto.ca/pubs/2005_flannigan_wotton_etal.pdf |title= Forest fires and climate change in the 21st century |last= Flannigan |first= M.D. |display-authors= etal |journal= Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change |doi= 10.1007/s11027-005-9020-7 |year= 2005 |volume= 11 |issue= 4 |page= 847 |s2cid= 2757472 |access-date= 2009-06-26 |archive-date= 2009-02-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226080607/https://www.firelab.utoronto.ca/pubs/2005_flannigan_wotton_etal.pdf |url-status= dead }} < /ref >

 [[Image:Boreal pine forest after fire.JPG |thumb |right|upright=2|alt=Two photographs of the same section of a pine forest; both show blackened bark at least halfway up the trees. The first picture is noticeably lacking in surface vegetation, while the second shows small, green grasses on the forest floor.|[[Ecological succession]] after a wildfire in a [[boreal forest|boreal pine forest]] next to Hara Bog, [[Lahemaa National Park]], [[Estonia]].

 Plants in wildfire-prone [[ecosystem]]s often have [[adaptation]]s to their local conditions. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and eliminate [[competition]]. For example, plants of the genus ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' contain flammable [[oil]]s that encourage fire and hard [[sclerophyll]] leaves that resist heat and [[drought]]. This makes them dominant over less fire-tolerant species. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm |title=Section Three: problems, cares, economics, and species |work=The Eucalyptus of California |first=Robert L. |last=Santos |publisher=California State University |year=1997 |access-date=2009-06-26 |archive-date=2010-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602175115/http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{citation |url= http://www.bushfire.nsw.gov.au/file_system/attachments/State08/Attachment_20050308_44889DFD.pdf |title= Fire: the Australian experience |publisher= NSW Rural Fire Service |access-date= 2009-02-04 |archive-date= 2008-07-22 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080722125603/http://www.bushfire.nsw.gov.au/file_system/attachments/State08/Attachment_20050308_44889DFD.pdf |url-status= dead }} < /ref >  Dense bark, shedding lower branches, and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures. < ref name=NOVA / >  Fire-resistant seeds and reserve [[shoot]]s that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation, as in '[[pioneer]]' species that specialize in restarting [[ecological succession]] after a fire. 
 
 Smoke, charred wood, and heat can stimulate the [[germination]] of seeds. Smoke from burning plants promotes contains orange [[butenolide]], which induces germination of seeds. < ref > {{cite journal | url = http://www.werc.usgs.gov/seki/pdfs/emissions.pdf |title= Trace gas emission in smoke-induced germination |author= Keeley, J.E. and C.J.

 Grasslands in Western [[Sabah]], Malaysian [[pine]] forests, and Indonesian ''[[Casuarina]]'' forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire. < ref > {{cite web | title = Community involvement in, and management of, forest fires in South East Asia | url = http://www.fao.org/forestry/11241-0-0.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070730211840/http://www.asiaforests.org/doc/resources/fire/pffsea/Report_Community.pdf |archive-date= 2007-07-30 |year= 2002 |publisher= Project FireFight South East Asia |last= Karki |first= Sameer |access-date= 2009-02-13

The optimum fire frequency for [[Caribbean pine]] in [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] pineyards is every 3 to 10 years. Too frequent fires favour [[herbaceous plant]]s, and infrequent fires favour other tree species. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/fire/files/bahamas_assessment.pdf |title=Fire management assessment of the Caribbean Pine (''Pinus caribea'') Forest Ecosystems on Andros and Abaco Islands, Bahamas |work=TNC Global Fire Initiative |publisher=The Nature Conservancy |date=September 2004 |access-date=2009-08-27 |archive-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201005807/http://www.nature.org/initiatives/fire/files/bahamas_assessment.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
