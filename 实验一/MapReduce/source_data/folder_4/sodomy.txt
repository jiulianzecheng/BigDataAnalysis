 Since about the [[Middle Ages]], '''sodomy''' is used for [[Sexual activity|sexual acts]] that do not have the purpose [[procreation]] (making babies). In general, this refers to [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[oral sex]]. In some cases, it is also used to refer to [[Zoophilia|sex with animals]] (which is usually called [[zoophilia]]). Depending on the time, the society and culture, there were laws that made sodomy a [[crime]]. Today, such laws have been overturned, or they are not enforced, in many countries of the world. 
 
 Countries where [[religion]] plays a large role may still have punishments for such crimes, as they are often mentioned in the [[scripture]]s of the religion which is important in the country. 
 
 Such laws, called [[Sodomy law|sodomy laws]], are sometimes also used to criminalize [[homosexuality]].
