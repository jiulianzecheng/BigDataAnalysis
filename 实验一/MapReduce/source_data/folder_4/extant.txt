In [[biology]], an '''extant''' group is one which has survived to the present day, and so it is a living group. This distinguishes it from an [[extinct]] group. 
 
 The term 'extant' can also be used to describe [[species]] or higher groups (such as [[genus|genera]] or [[family (biology)|families]]) which are still in existence (living). < ref name=Barnes > Barnes, Robert D. 1982.

 Example: in the group of [[mollusc]]s known as the [[cephalopod]]s, there are about 600 extant species and 7500 extinct species.
