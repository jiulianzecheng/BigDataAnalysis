 '''Sangria ''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|s|æ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|ə}},{{lang-es|sangría}} {{IPA-es|saŋˈɡɾi.a|}}) is a kind of [[mixed drink]] on the basis of [[red wine]]. The name is protected. Under [[European Union|EU]] regulations, Sangria may only be produced in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. [[Citrus fruit]] and red [[berries]] are commonly added. Some recipes also add spirits to boost the amount of [[alcohol]].  Sangria is usually served cold. According to the EU regulation, Sangria contains between 4.5 and 12% [[alcohol by volume]]. 
 
 == Variations == 
 Depending on the location, [[cider]] is used instead of red wine. Sometimes, [[sparkling wine]], mostly [[Cava]], is used instead. Other kinds of white wine have also been used. To make the drink suitable for children, the red wine can be replaced with [[fruit juice]] or a [[soft drink]]. The resulting drink then contains no [[alcohol]].
