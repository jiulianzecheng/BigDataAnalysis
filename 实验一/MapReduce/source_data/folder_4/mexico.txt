Mexico is south of [[Texas]], [[California]] and other [[America]]n states. [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]] are south of Mexico. Mexico is between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. 
 
 People living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans. Most Mexican people speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Some Mexicans speak [[Native American]] languages, like [[Nahuatl]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], and [[Zapotec language|Zapotec]]. Most modern Mexicans are descended from [[Native American]]s such as [[Aztecs]] and [[Maya people|Mayans]] and mostly have native blood. They are [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The capital of Mexico is [[Mexico City]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 Before the Europeans came, many Native American cultures existed in Mexico. The earliest was the [[Olmec]] culture in the south. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucatán [[peninsula]] lived the [[Mayans]]. The Mayans lived in [[city states]] ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between [[200]] and [[900]] A.D. Another powerful empire belonged to [[Teotihuacan]]. Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest at that time. After Teotihuacan declined the [[Toltecs]] became powerful. Things made by the Toltecs have been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to [[Costa Rica]]. A famous Toltec god is [[Quetzalcoatl]]. The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the [[Aztecs]]. The Aztecs called their own [[empire]] Mexico. A famous Aztec king was [[Moctezuma II]]. 
 
 In [[1519]] the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[explorer]] [[Hernán Cortés]] came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In [[1521]] they conquered the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]]. The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called [[New Spain]]. 
 
 In [[1810]] the Mexican priest [[Miguel Hidalgo]] started the [[Mexican war of independence]]. In [[1821]] the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was [[Agustin de Iturbide]]. He set up the [[First Mexican Empire]] and became emperor. But the [[Mexican]]s were not happy with him, and in [[1823]] the country became a [[republic]]. 
 
 A man who was very important in Mexico in the early [[19th century]] was [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]. He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he became a [[dictator]], [[Texas]] declared independence (1836). The [[Battle of the Alamo]] was part of this [[Texas Revolution]]. Between 1846 and 1848 there was [[Mexican-American War|war between Mexico and the United States]]. In this war Mexico lost its large northern areas, which became the [[southwestern United States]]. After this war Santa Anna was [[exile|sent away]] to [[Venezuela]]. 
 
 Between [[1858]] and [[1861]] there was war again, between [[liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]]. The liberal [[Benito Juárez]] won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until [[France]] invaded Mexico and made [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. But Maximilian was very unpopular. After [[Cinco de Mayo|more war]] he was [[death penalty|executed]] in [[1867]], and Juarez became president again. 
 
 Conservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In [[1876]] they ousted him, and made [[Porfirio Díaz]], a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio Díaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. Franciso I. Madero started the [[Mexican Revolution]] in [[1910]]. 
 
 The next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are [[Emiliano Zapata]], [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Francisco I. Madero]]. When [[Álvaro Obregón]] became president in [[1920]] the fighting calmed down. 
 
 In [[1929]] President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents were not popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]]. He was president between [[1934]] and [[1940]]. 
 
 After several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI. In 1968 security forces shot at protesters, this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the [[Tlatelolco massacre]]. Another uprising was in [[1994]] when [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] rebelled in the province [[Chiapas]]. 
 
 Mainly through election [[fraud]], the PRI managed to stay into power until [[2000]], when [[Vicente Fox]] of the National Action Party, PAN, was elected president. In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years.

 == Geography == 
 Mexico is in the southern part of [[North America]]. It is roughly shaped like a [[triangle]]. Mexico is more than 3000 & nbsp;km (1,850 miles) long from northwest to southeast. Mexico is between two large seas: the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the West and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] in the East. Mexico has two large [[peninsula]]s. [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California]] in the northwest, and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] in the southeast. In central and western Mexico are the [[Sierra Madre]] mountains. In the Sierra Madre is the [[Pico de Orizaba]], the highest [[mountain]] of Mexico. In central Mexico there are also a few [[volcano]]es like the [[Popocatépetl]] and the [[Iztaccíhuatl]]. The Pico de Orizaba is also a volcano. In the north of Mexico are [[desert]]s. In the south are tropical [[rainforest]]s. Some rivers in Mexico are the [[Rio Grande|Río Bravo]] (known in the US as the Rio Grande), the [[Río Balsas]], the [[Río Pánuco]], and the [[Río Yaqui]].
