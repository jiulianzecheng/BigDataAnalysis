 '''Khaba''' was a [[Pharaoh]] of the 3rd dynasty of Ancient Egypt. His predecessor was [[Sekhemkhet]], and his successor was [[Huni]]. Khaba's reign is dated from 2640 BC to 2637 BC.  
 
 We do not know who Khaba's parents were, but it is most likely that he was a son of [[Sekhemkhet]] and his wife [[Djeseretnebti]]. It is possible that Khaba was a father of Huni and grandfather of [[Sneferu]].
