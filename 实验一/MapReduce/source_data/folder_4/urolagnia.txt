 '''Urolagnia''' (also '''urophilia''', '''undinism''') is  when people gain sexual pleasure from [[urine]] and/or [[urination]].  The term has origins in the [[Greek Language]] (from ''ouron'', urine, and ''lagneia'', lust). < ref name= " ency " > {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-i9rHgAACAAJ |title=A Dictionary of Psychology |last=Colman |first=Andrew M. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19280-632-1 |accessdate=2009-01-08 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref name= " SexDev-googlebooks " > {{cite book |title= Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment |last=Laws |first=Dr. Richard |author2= William T.

 Those who enjoy urolagnia may enjoy urinating on other people, or being urinated on. The practice of drinking the urine is called [[urophagia]]. People who practice urolagnia may play in a [[Domination  &  submission (BDSM)|domination and submission]] scene.   
 
 These activities are often described with the slang terms ''golden showers'', ''water sports'', or ''piss play''. Uncontrollable ''bladder desperation'' or ''panty wetting'' is socially a different matter. 
 
 In [[New Zealand]], publishing anything promoting or supporting urolagnia, whether in print or online, is an offence punishable by up to ten years in prison. < ref name= " OfficCensp " > {{cite web |url=http://www.censorship.govt.nz/censorship.html |title=Censorship |work=Office of Film and Literature Classification |publisher=Government of New Zealand |year=2007 |access-date=2009-04-16 |archive-date=2008-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723151722/http://www.censorship.govt.nz/censorship.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " k-b " > {{cite web |url=http://gpacts.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/reprint/text/2005/se/042se3.html |work=Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act |year=1993 |title=Meaning of objectionable |publisher=Government of New Zealand |quote=(d) the use of urine or excrement in association with degrading or dehumanising conduct or sexual conductâ€¦ |access-date=2009-04-16 |archive-date=2008-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014124816/http://gpacts.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/reprint/text/2005/se/042se3.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " 10ypen " > {{cite web |url=http://www.censorship.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Amendment-Act-2005?OpenDocument |title=Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Amendment Act 2005 |quote=As amended, a person who knowingly trades, distributes or makes objectionable materials now faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. |work=Dept. of Internal Affairs |publisher=Government of New Zealand |date=2008-01-28 }} < /ref >  Probably that law is rarely used.
