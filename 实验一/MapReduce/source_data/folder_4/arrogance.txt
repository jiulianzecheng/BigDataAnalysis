 '''Arrogance''' (also called '''hubris''') indicates strong [[pride]] or acting extremely self-important. In particular, a loss of contact with [[reality]] and overestimating one's own competence or capability. < ref > {{cite web|title=Arrogance|publisher=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arrogance|access-date=January 9, 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 It is when you try to reason out or state your case over a traffic violation to an enforcer - only in the Philippines. 
 
 Arrogance is also associated with lack of humility and love toward oneself. Examples include making oneself far more important than others or superiority. [[Child]]ren raised around arrogance may be arrogant themselves. < ref > {{cite web|title=Arrogance Defined|publisher=Human Solutions|url=http://www.wilsonbanwell.com/articles/general_interest/about_arrogance.htm|access-date=January 9, 2014|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304123204/http://www.wilsonbanwell.com/articles/general_interest/about_arrogance.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Arrogance is usually detrimental and fosters a negative-minded [[culture]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Arrogance and its Negative Effects|publisher=Matrix of Mnemosyne|url=http://www.matrixbookstore.biz/arrogance.htm|access-date=January 9, 2014|archive-date=September 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902121402/http://www.matrixbookstore.biz/arrogance.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Some sources, however, also indicate arrogance means taking and receiving pride with one's work. < ref > {{cite web|title=Why Arrogance Can be Good|publisher=Lifescript (Healthy Living for Women)|url=http://www.lifescript.com/soul/self/growth/personality_traits_why_arrogance_intolerance_and_selfishness_can_be_good.aspx|access-date=January 9, 2014|archive-date=December 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222154423/http://www.lifescript.com/soul/self/growth/personality_traits_why_arrogance_intolerance_and_selfishness_can_be_good.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 '''Hubris''' is the [[ancient Greek]] concept. It is similar to arrogance, but is usually translated as ''[[pride]]''. Because their societies were more concerned with honour, it works out as somewhat different from arrogance. To understand it fully one needs to work through the Greek passages where it is used, which is beyond our scope. For example, the use of force to shame someone would have been considered hubris. < ref name= " Britannica " > {{cite encyclopedia |title=Hubris|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=21 April 2016}} < /ref >
