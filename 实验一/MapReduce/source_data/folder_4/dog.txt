 '''Dogs''' are  [[mammal]]s, usually kept as pets or for work on farms or police. Some dogs are trained to be rescue dogs, and join teams such as mountain rescue. They have been bred by humans from their ancestral wolves. They were the first animals to live with humans, as far as we know. < ref > Irving-Pease, Evan K.; Ryan, Hannah; Jamieson, Alexandra; Dimopoulos, Evangelos A.; Larson, Greger; Frantz, Laurent A.F. 2018. Paleogenomics of Animal Domestication. In Lindqvist, C.; Rajora, O. (eds) ''Paleogenomics. Population Genomics''. Springer, Cham. pp. 225–272. doi:10.1007/13836_2018_55. ISBN 978-3-030-04752-8 < /ref >   
 
 There was a lot of variety among wolves in the Late [[Pleistocene]]. < ref name= " Thalmann2018 "  / >  The [[dingo]] is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live independently of humans in the range where they occur (parts of [[Australia]]). 
 
 Today, some dogs are used as [[pet]]s, and others are used to help humans do their work. They are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal, and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the [[United States]] are [[wikt:register|registered]] as [[pet]]s. < ref > {{cite book| last = Gifford| first = Clive| title = Family Flip Quiz Geography| year = 2002| publisher = Miles Kelly Publishing| isbn = 978-1-84236-146-7| author2 = Lisa Clayden }} < /ref >  Dogs eat both [[meat]] and [[vegetable]]s, often mixed together and sold in stores as [[dog food]]. Dogs often have jobs, including police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs. 
 
 They are sometimes called  " canines "  from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for dog - ''canis''.  [[wolf|Wolves]] are also canids. A baby dog is called a '''pup''' or '''puppy'''. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old. < ref > {{Cite web|title=When Does My Puppy Finish Growing? How Long Do Puppies Grow?|url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/when-does-my-puppy-finish-growing/|access-date=2021-05-03|website=American Kennel Club|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Dogs are sometimes referred to as  " man's best friend "  because they are kept as domestic pets, are usually loyal, and like being around humans.  Dogs like to be petted, but only when they can first see the petter's hand before petting; one should never pet a dog from behind.

 == Appearance and behaviour == 
 Dogs can smell and hear better than humans but cannot see well in [[color]] because they are [[color blindness|color blind]]. Due to the anatomy of the eye, dogs can see better in dim light than humans. They also have a wider field of vision. 
 
 Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called [[pack (canine)|packs]]. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with a higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the [[alpha male]]. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQ63-D3C9wcC & dq=domesticated+dogs+view+owner+as+alpha+male & pg=PA52|title=Domestic Cats: Their History, Breeds and Other Facts|last=Robbins|first=Nancy|date=2012-02-14|publisher=Nancy Robbins|isbn=978-1-4700-7538-5|page=52|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Lifespan of dogs == 
 [[File:Dog and human year graph(fixed).png|thumb|This graph shows the correlation between weight and lifespan.]] 
 Different dog breeds have different lifespans. In general, smaller dogs live longer than bigger ones. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/good-dogs-live-longer.html |title=Good Dogs Live Longer & nbsp;— ScienceNOW |access-date=2011-05-18 |archive-date=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129221514/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/04/good-dogs-live-longer.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The size and the breed of the dog change how long the dog lives, on average. Breeds such as the [[Dachshund]] usually live for fifteen years, [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahuas]] can reach age twenty. On the other hand, the [[Great Dane]] has an average lifespan of six to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for ten years. An American Bulldog lives for around 15 years. Bigger dogs will have smaller lives than smaller dogs because of the pressure on its heart to move around.    
 
 == Origin of dogs == 
 All dogs are descended from [[wolf|wolves]], by [[domestication]] and [[artificial selection]]. This is known because [[DNA]] [[genome]] [[wikt:analysis|analysis]] has been done to discover this. < ref > Lindblad-Toh K, Wade CM, Mikkelsen TS ''et al.'' 2005. Genome sequence, comparative analysis, and [[haplotype]] structure of the domestic dog. ''Nature'' '''438''' pp803–819 < /ref > < ref > Savolainen, Peter; Ya-ping Zhang, Jing Luo, Joakim Lundeberg, Thomas Leitner 2002. Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs. ''Science'' '''298''' pp1610–3. < /ref >  They have been [[wikt:breed|bred]] by humans. The earliest known [[fossil]] of a domestic dog is from 31,700 years ago in [[Belgium]]. < ref > [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370 World's first dog lived 31,700 years ago, ate big] Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News, 10/17/2008 < /ref >  Dogs have lived with people for at least 30,000 years. In 2013, a study was published that showed that the skull and teeth of a canid dated as 33,000 years, had characteristics closer to a dog than to a wolf. The authors concluded that  " this specimen may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication, i.e., an  " incipient "  dog. "   The researchers suggest that it was a line that did not lead to modern dogs. < ref > Nikolai D. Ovodov u. & nbsp;a.: ''A 33,000-Year-Old Incipient Dog from the Altai Mountains of Siberia: Evidence of the Earliest Domestication Disrupted by the Last Glacial Maximum.'' In: ''[[PLoS ONE]]'' 6(7), 2011 [[doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022821]] < /ref >  Genetically, this material is closer to that of a modern dog than that of a wolf. < ref name= " Druzhkova " > A.S. Druzhkova, O. Thalmann, V.A. Trifonov, J.A. Leonard, N.V. Vorobieva et al.: ''Ancient DNA Analysis Affirms the Canid from Altai as a Primitive Dog.'' In: PLoS ONE, Band 8(3), 2013 [[doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0057754]] < /ref >  Other signs of domestication are that sometimes, dogs were buried together with humans. < ref > Darcy F. Morey: ''Burying key evidence: the social bond between dogs and people.'' In: Journal of Archaeological Science, Band 33/2, 2006, S. 158–175. {{doi|10.1016/j.jas.2005.07.009}} < /ref >  Evidence of this is a tomb in [[Bonn]], where a man of about 50 years of age, a woman of about 25 years of age, the remains of a dog, plus other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] were found. [[Radiocarbon dating]] showed that the human bones were between 13.300 and 14.000 years old. 
 
 == Dogs and humans == 
 Dogs are often called  " man's best [[friend]] "  because they fit in with human life. Man refers to humankind and not just guys ([[Old English]]). Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are [[guard dog]]s, [[hunting dog]]s, [[Sheepdog|herding dogs]], [[guide dog]]s for [[blind]] people, and [[police dog]]s. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or [[illegal drugs]]. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually [[beagle]]s) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by [[Russia]]ns into [[outer space]], a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was named [[Laika]], but she died within a few hours. < gallery >

 == Dog breeds == 
 [[File:Big_and_little_dog_1.jpg|thumb|200px|Dogs are bred into very different breeds: here a [[Great Dane]] and a small [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]].]] 
 :''See also [[List of dog breeds]].'' 
 There are at least 800 [[list of dog breeds|breeds]] (kinds) of dogs. {{cn|date=August 2023}} Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed: these dogs are called [[purebred]] or pure [[pedigree]] dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called ''mutts'', ''[[mixed-breed dog]]s'', ''[[hybrid]]s'', or ''mongrels''. Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs, collies, [[poodle]]s and retrievers. It is becoming popular to breed together two different breeds of dogs and call the new dog's breed a name that is a mixture of the parents' breeds' two names. A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo. Instead of being called mutts, these kinds of dogs are known as designer dog breeds. These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows. 
 They can be guide dogs.
