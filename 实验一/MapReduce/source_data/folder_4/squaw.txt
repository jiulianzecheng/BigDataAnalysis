'''Squaw''' is a word that refers to an [[Indigenous]] [[woman]] in the [[Native American|United States]] or [[First Nations|Canada]]. 
 
 Many Native Americans say this a bad word because people have used it in [[racism|racist]] and [[misogyny|woman-hating]] ways.  According to the editor of the ''[[Navajo Times]]'' Tom Aviso,  " squaw "  is the worst word used on Native American women.

 == Origin == 
 The word  " squaw "  comes from the [[Algonquian languages]], where it means  " woman.

"  In Cree, it is  " iskwew. " 
 
 Some people say that the word  " squaw "  comes from a Mohawk word that means [[vagina]]. However, many linguists, for example Ives Goddard of the [[Smithsonian]], think this is not so. They think  " squaw "  really came from the regular Massachusetts word  " squa, "  for  " woman. " < ref name= " History "  / > 
 
 == Current use == 
 Squaw is considered an offensive word because many non-Natives have used it to disrespect Native American and Aboriginal Canadian women. 
 
 Some people in Indigenous communities think  " squaw "  is offensive. According to members of the Nooksack Tribal Council, Native Americans in general see  " squaw "  as an insulting word. < ref name= " Bell " > {{cite news|author=Kie Relyea|title=Nooksack Tribe convinces the state to change this creek's name because it's offensive|url=https://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/local/article236586228.html|access-date=July 13, 2020|publisher=Bellingham Herald}} < /ref > < ref name= " Stream " > {{cite web|url=https://whatcom.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F & ID=7789959 & GUID=783D75FF-8909-4F66-BB3C-849EA8CED2CA|access-date=July 13, 2020|title=Washington State Geographic Name Change Application (form) |publisher=Washington State Department of Natural Resources|author=George Swanaset Jr.|date=May 23, 2019}} < /ref >  Other Native Americans think the word should be ''reclaimed'', meaning made a normal word again. < ref name= " ICT " > {{cite news|url=https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/the-word-squaw-offensive-or-not-AOz_cjbLkEaxKaUEa6kejg|publisher=Indian Country Today|title=The Word Squaw: Offensive or Not? |access-date=July 13, 2020|date=March 23, 2017|author=Vincent Schilling}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[root (linguistics)|root]] of  " squaw "  is in some [[compound word]]s in Algonquin languages that are spoken today:  " nidobaskwa "  means  " female friend, "   " manigebeskwa "  means  " woman of the woods, "  and  " Squaw Sachem "  means  " female chief. " < ref name= " ICT "  / > 
 
 == Historical use == 
 European colonizers used the word to talk about Indigenous women. 
 
 When white colonists moved west, they used words like  " squaw "  even when they were talking about women whose tribes spoke languages different from Algonquian.  It became a [[generic]] word. < ref name= " Ferris " > {{cite web|publisher=Ferris University|title=I is for Ignoble: Stereotyping Native Americans|date=February 22, 2018|author1=Arlene Hirschfelder |author2=Paulette F.

 === Stereotype === 
 European men in the US and Canada were not respectful of Indigenous women. They used them for sex. When they called the women  " squaw, "  they used it in a way that showed that they saw those women as sex objects and not human beings.  Over time, the word  " squaw "  came to mean a woman who was dirty, sexually abused, violent, fit only for mindless work or some group of these. < ref name= " UOregon "  / > 
 
 According to scholars, for example D. Francis and D. Merskin, the squaw is the second most common [[stereotype]] of Native American women.  The most common is the [[Indian princess]].  The two stereotypes work as a pair.  The princess was imagined as beautiful and sexually well-behaved.  The squaw was imagined as ugly, dirty and sexually available. < ref name= " UOregon "  / > 
 
 Scholars say white people stuck to the idea of the squaw so they could say American Indian culture was bad.  They pretended the cultures were full of lazy men who forced women to do all the real work.  That way, they could make it sound like [[ethnocide|wiping out the culture]] of Native Americans was a good thing. < ref name= " UOregon "  / > 
 
 == Name changes == 
 People in the US and Canada are trying to change place names with the word  " squaw "  in it because they feel it is not respectful to Indigenous women. However, there are still many places where the word is in the name. 
 
 === United States ===

 * In 2015, the government of the city of Buffalo, NY, voted to change  " Squaw Island "  to  " Unity Island "  (''Deyowenoguhdoh'' in the Seneca language). 
 * In 2020, the government of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] agreed to change  " Squaw Creek "  back to  " Páatstel Creek "  because the Nooksack Tribal Council asked them to. < ref name= " Bell "  / > < ref name= " Stream "  / > 
 
 === Canada ===

 * On November 20, 2018, Killsquaw Lake in Saskatchewan - the site of a 19th century massacre of a group of Cree women - was renamed Kikiskitotawânawak Iskêwak, which, in Cree, means  " we honor the women. "  This is important because [[missing and murdered Indigenous women]] is a big problem in Canada.
