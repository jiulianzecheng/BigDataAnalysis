 An '''extremophile''' is an [[organism]] (a living thing) which lives best in extreme conditions that are [[harm]]ful to most life on Earth. < ref > Wilson ZE, Brimble MA 2009.

''Polyextremophiles: life under multiple forms of stress''. Dordrecht: Springer. ISBN 978-94-007-6488-0 < /ref >  They are different from organisms that live in normal places, called ''mesophiles'' or ''neutrophiles''. 
 
 In the 1980s and 1990s, [[Biologist|biologists]] found that [[Microorganism|microbes]] can survive in extreme environments. These are [[niche]]s that are extreme in some way. They may be extremely hot, or cold, or dry, or under huge [[pressure]], or very [[salt]]y or [[acid]]ic. Complex organisms, such as animals or plants, cannot live in these environments. < ref > Hogan, C. Michael 2010. Extremophile. In (eds) Monosson E.  &  Cleveland C. ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. National Council of Science  &  the Environment. [http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/160977/] < /ref >   
 
 Some scientists suggest that life may have begun on Earth in [[hydrothermal vent]]s far below the [[ocean]] surface. < ref >  {{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars exploration - Press kit |accessdate=2009-07-14 |date=June 2003 |publisher=NASA }} < /ref >  Environments such as hot oceans, [[hot spring]]s and deep ocean [[hydrothermal vent]]s would have been common during the [[Archaean]] [[eon]], about 3.9 [[billion]] years ago. Early forms of life lived in those conditions. < ref > Gouy M.  &  Chaussidon M. 2008. Ancient bacteria liked it hot. ''Nature'' '''451''': p635. < /ref > 
 
 == Types of extremophiles == 
 Most known extremophiles are [[microbe]]s. The domain [[Archaea]] has well-known examples of extremophiles, but some [[bacteria]] are also extremophiles. It is a mistake to use the term extremophile for all archaeans, since some of them are mesophilic. Not all extremophiles are unicellular: some extreme environments have animals which are [[multicellular]].  
 
 Some extremophiles fall under several categories. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are both ''thermophilic'' and ''barophilic''. < ref > barophilic = lives under high pressure < /ref > 
 
 ; [[Acidophile]]s: An organism that grows best at [[pH]] levels of 3 or below. 
 ; [[Alkaliphile]]s: An organism that grows best at [[pH]] levels of 9 or above 
 ; [[Endolith]]s: An organism that lives in [[Microscope|microscopic]] spaces within rocks, fissures, aquifers, and faults filled with groundwater deep under the ground. 
 ; [[Halophile]]s: An organism that needs a high concentration of salt to grow. < ref > Cavicchioli R.  &  Thomas T. 2000. Extremophiles. In: J. Lederberg (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Microbiology'', 2nd ed, Vol 2, pp317–337. Academic Press, San Diego. < /ref > 
 ; [[Hyperthermophile]]: An organism that can live well at temperatures between 80–122 °C, as in hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean. 
 ; Hypoliths: An organism that lives inside rocks in cold deserts. 
 ; [[Lithoautotroph]]s: An organism (usually bacteria) that only gets [[carbon]] from [[carbon dioxide]] and inorganic [[oxidation]]. They are chemolithotrophs, such as ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]''. These organisms get energy from [[mineral]] compounds such as [[iron pyrite]]s. They act in geochemical cycling and wearing away of bedrock to form [[soil]]. 
 ; [[Metalotolerant]]: These organisms are not harmed by high levels of dissolved heavy metals in solution, such as [[copper]], [[cadmium]], [[arsenic]], and [[zinc]]. 
 ; [[Oligotroph]]: An organism that can grow in environments with very few nutrients. 
 ; [[Osmophile]]: An organism that can grow in environments with lots of sugar. 
 ; Piezophile: An organism that lives best under high [[pressure]], such as deep inside the Earth's surface and in deep [[ocean trench]]es. 
 ; Polyextremophile: An organism that is in more than one category of extremophiles. 
 ; Psychrophile/Cryophile: An organism that grows better at temperatures of 15 °C or lower. They are common in cold soils, permafrost, polar ice, cold ocean water, and under snow in high mountains. 
 ; [[Radioresistant]]: Organisms that can live with high levels of [[ionizing radiation]]. Usually this refers to  [[ultraviolet]] radiation, but there are also some organisms which can repair damage cause by [[gamma radiation]]. 
 ; [[Thermophile]]: An organism that can live well at temperatures between 60–80 °C. 
 ; Thermoacidophile: An organism that is both a ''thermophile'' and an ''acidophile''. It grows best in temperatures of 70–80 °C and pH between 2 and 3. 
 ; [[Xerophile]]: An organism that can grow in extremely dry places, such as the [[Atacama Desert]].
