 '''''Plateosaurus''''' is a [[prosauropod]] [[dinosaur]] [[genus]]. They lived during the [[Upper Triassic]] period, around 214 to 294 million years ago in what is now [[Europe]]. < ref > Weishampel D.B. ''et al'' 2004. In Weishampel D.B.; Dodson P.  &  Osmólska H. (eds.), ''The Dinosauria''. 2 ed, Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 524. {{ISBN|978-0-520-25408-4}} < /ref > 
 
 They were very common in their day. Over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. Many fossils have come from [[Swabia (Government Region)|Swabia]], [[Germany]]. 
 
 ''Plateosaurus'' was the first long-necked plant eater in the Triassic. An adult ''Plateosaurus'' could weigh up to {{convert|1,500|lb}} and grow {{convert |27|ft}} long. They  had plump plant-crushing teeth, powerful hind limbs, short but muscular arms and grasping hands with large claws on three fingers. They probably used their sharp thumb [[claws]] to defend themselves against predators. < ref >  Barrett, Paul M. 2000.

 The explanation of the large number of skeletons is that the areas were probably mud-traps. < ref > Fraas, Eberhard (1913).
