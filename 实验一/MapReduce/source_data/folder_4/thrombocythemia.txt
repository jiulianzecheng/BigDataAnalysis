 When the cause is unknown, the term thrombocythemia is used, as either primary thrombocythyemia or essential thrombocythemia. This is caused by problems found in the [[bone marrow]], cells that overproduce the platelets. The cause of these problems is unknown. < ref name= " NIH " > {{cite web |title=Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis {{!}} National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) |url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/thrombocythemia-and-thrombocytosis |website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov |access-date=20 December 2019}} < /ref >
