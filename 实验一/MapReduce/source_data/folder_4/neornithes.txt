'''Neornithes''' are the most recent [[common ancestor]] of all living birds and all their [[descendant]]s. There are about 9,000 to 10,000 known living species in the world.

 Modern birds are divided into two [[superorder]]s; the [[Palaeognathae]] ([[tinamou]]s and flightless [[ratite]]s), and the [[Neognathae]], containing all other birds. 
 
 It is generally agreed that the Neornithes evolved in the [[Cretaceous]] and that the split between the Palaeognathae and Neognathae, and then the split between [[fowl]] and the other Neognathae, occurred before the [[K/T extinction event]]. The earliest fossil remains of the Neornithes might be about ten million years after the start of the Cretaceous. ''[[Gallornis]]'' may be the first fossil, but its remains are only a worn partial femur and a fragment of the humerus. < ref > Hope, Sylvia 2002. The Mesozoic radiation of Neornithes.

 There are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs. < ref name=Eric > {{cite journal |author=Ericson P.G.P. | display-authors = etal |date=22 December 2006 |title=Diversification of Neoaves: integration of molecular sequence data and fossils |journal=Biol Lett |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=543–547 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523 |pmc=1834003 |pmid=17148284}} < /ref >  Molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while [[fossil]] evidence suggest an early [[Tertiary]] radiation.

 The classification of modern birds is difficult. Sibley  &  Ahlquist's ''Phylogeny and classification of birds'' (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds, though it is often debated and revised. Most evidence suggests that the modern bird orders are accurate [[taxon|taxa]]. < ref > Romer A.S.  &  Parsons T. S. 1985.
