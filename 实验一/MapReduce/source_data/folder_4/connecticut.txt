 '''Connecticut''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]]. Its [[Capital (city)|capital]] is [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and its largest city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is one of the six states of [[New England]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 The highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York meet (42° 3' N; 73° 29' W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts. 
 
 The [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into [[Long Island Sound]], Connecticut's outlet to the Atlantic Ocean.  
 
 The state, although small, has regional variations in its landscape and culture from the wealthy estates of Fairfield County's  " Gold Coast "  to the rolling mountains and horse-farms of the [[Litchfield]] Hills of northwestern Connecticut. Connecticut's [[rural area]]s and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New Haven, then northwards to Hartford, as well as further up the coast near New London. Many towns center around a small park, known as a  " green, "  (such as the New Haven Green). Near the green may stand a small white church, a town meeting hall, a tavern, and several colonial houses. Forests, rivers, lakes, waterfalls and a sandy shore add to the state's beauty. 
 
 The southwestern corner of Connecticut, where it touches New York State, includes Greenwich, Stamford, Fairfield, Westport, Wilton, and Darien. These places house some of the wealthiest residents in the world. 
 
 Areas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]]; Quinebaug  &  Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor; and Weir Farm National Historic Site. 
 
 ==History== 
 The name  " Connecticut "  comes from the [[Mohegan]] Indian word  " Quinnehtukqut " . It means  " Long River Place "  or  " Beside the Long Tidal River. "  The first explorer from Europe to come to Connecticut was Adriaen Block, from the [[Netherlands]]. After he explored this region in 1614, Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River (Named Versche Rivier by the Dutch) and built a fort near present-day Hartford, which they called  " House of Hope "  (Dutch: Huys de Hoop). 
 
 The first English settlers came in 1633. They were [[Puritan]]s from [[Massachusetts]], who were led by the Reverend [[Thomas Hooker]]. They founded the Connecticut Colony. Colonies were also established at Old Saybrook and New Haven, which later became part of Connecticut. Historically important colonial settlements included: Windsor (1633), Wethersfield (1634), Saybrook (1635), Hartford (1636), New Haven (1638), and New London (1646). 
 
 Because the Dutch were outnumbered by the English settlers, they left their fort in 1654. Connecticut's first [[constitution]], the  " Fundamental Orders, "  was adopted on January 14, 1639, while its current constitution, the third for Connecticut, was adopted in 1965. Connecticut is the fifth of the original thirteen states. 
 
 The western boundaries of Connecticut have changed over time. According to a 1650 agreement with the Dutch, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from the west side of Greenwich Bay  " provided the said line come not within 10 & nbsp;miles [16 km] of [[Hudson River]]. "  On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the  " South Sea, "  i.e. the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This probably added confusion to the early forefathers because the Pacific Ocean is located on the west coast of the United States. Agreements with New York, the  " Pennamite Wars "  with [[Pennsylvania]] over Westmoreland County, followed by Congressional intervention, and the relinquishment and sale of the Western Reserve lands brought the state to its present boundaries.
