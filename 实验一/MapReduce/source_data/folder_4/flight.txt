 '''Flight''' or '''flying''' is a process of [[movement]] of an object in a [[gaseous]] [[environment]] or a [[vacuum]]. In practice this means it moves through the [[air]]. 
 
 == Animals == 
 Best adapted for long controlled powered flight are flying [[birds]] and [[insects]], < ref > Sane, S. P. (1 December 2003).  " The aerodynamics of insect flight " . Journal of Experimental Biology. 206 (23): 4191â€“4208. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14581590/] < /ref >  [[bats]] ([[Chiroptera]]), and the [[extinct]] [[pterosaurs]]. < ref > Pei, Rui; Pittman, Michael; Goloboff, Pablo A.; Dececchi, T. Alexander; Habib, Michael B.; Kaye, Thomas G.; Larsson, Hans C. E.; Norell, Mark A.; Brusatte, Stephen L.; Xu, Xing (6 August 2020).  " Potential for Powered Flight Neared by Most Close Avialan Relatives, but Few Crossed Its Thresholds " . Current Biology. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32763170/] < /ref >   
 
 All of these animals use (or used) the [[aerodynamic]] principles of flight, using the load-bearing properties of the [[wing]] for active flight. There are also many animals that [[glide]] and parachute flight, such as some spiders' webs, [[aeroplankton]], flying clams, [[flying fish]], and various forest-dwelling mammals and reptiles.  
 
 The fastest flying animal is the [[peregrine falcon]]. The speed of its dive is over {{convert|370|kph|abbr=off}}. 
 
 ==Floating flight== 
 An [[aerostat]] is a system that remains in the air by the use of floating. Man-made aerostats include balloons and [[airship]]s. An aerostat's main structural component is its envelope, a lightweight skin containing a lifting gas to provide floating, to which other parts are attached. By contrast, [[aerodyne]]s use aerodynamic lift, which requires the movement of the aircraft through the surrounding [[air mass]]. 
 
 There are a huge number of plants which distribute their [[spores]] or [[seeds]] by air. Many [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]] do so as well. With these very small objects, the [[surface area]] is great in proportion to its [[weight]]. That is why they lift off.
