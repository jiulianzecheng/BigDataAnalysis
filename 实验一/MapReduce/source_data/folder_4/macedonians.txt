 '''Macedonians''' ({{lang-mk|Македонци|Makedonci}}) are a [[nation]] and a South [[Slavs|Slavic]] ethnic group native to the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] in [[Southeast Europe]]. They speak the [[Macedonian language|slavic Macedonian language.]] 
 
 ==Origins== 
 The Slavic languages from which Macedonian developed are thought to have grown in the region during the post-Roman period. < ref name= " Curta " > Curta, Florin 2001. ''The making of the Slavs: history and archaeology of the lower Danube region, c. 500-700''. Cambridge University Press, 148. {{ISBN|0-521-80202-4}} < /ref >  Many parts of Macedonian culture developed during the rule of Medieval [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] Empires.  Each of these empires controlled the region for a time. 
 
 Macedonians' [[genetic]] background is thought to be the same as Balkan prehistoric and historic [[South Slavs#Genetics|demographic processes]]. < ref > Marijana Peričić | display-authors = etal 2005.

 The appearance of [[Slavs|Ril Slavs]] in Macedonia and the [[Balkans]] happened after the end of Roman authority. < ref name=Curta/ > < ref name=Greg > Gregory T.E. 2010. ''A history of Byzantium''. Wiley-Blackwell, 169. < /ref >  Migrations into the area happened, but on a smaller scale:  
 < blockquote > " It is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the Balkans after the Slavic  " invasions "  were probably for the most part the same as those who had lived there earlier, although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbours, including the Byzantines " . < ref name=Greg/ > < /blockquote >   
 Later, the Sclaveni in Macedonia were added into the Bulgarian Empire. 
 
 The history of the slavic Macedonians has been shaped by population shifts and political developments in the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. After the end of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 20th century, the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] was created after [[World War II]], a state in the framework of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. 
 
 ==Population== 
 A large majority of ethnic Macedonians live along the valley of the river [[Vardar]], the central region of North Macedonia. They form about 64.18% of the population of North Macedonia (1,297,981 people according to the [http://www.stat.gov.mk/english/glavna_eng.asp?br=18 2002 census] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040621055714/http://www.stat.gov.mk/english/glavna_eng.asp?br=18 |date=2004-06-21 }}). Smaller numbers live in eastern [[Albania]], northern Greece, and southern [[Serbia]], mostly near the border areas of North Macedonia, small part of southern [[Kosovo]] and form a majority in the west-south region in [[Bulgaria]]. A large number of Macedonians have immigrated overseas to Australia, United States, Canada and in many European countries: Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Austria, among others. 
 
 ===Economy=== 
 In the past, the Macedonian population was mostly involved with agriculture. The beginning of the People's Republic of Macedonia started a social change.  The change was based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started. 
 
 ===Language=== 
 {{main|Macedonian language}} 
 
 The Macedonian language ({{Lang-mk|македонски јазик}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. Standard Macedonian was started as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]].  After being codified in the 1940s, a strong [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]] has developed. 
 
 The closest relative of Macedonian is [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croat]] along with some Bulgarian dialects. All the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] languages, including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian. 
 
 The [[orthography]] of Macedonian includes an alphabet, which is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]].  There are also language-specific ways of spelling and punctuation. 
 
 ==Symbols== 
 * '''''Sun:''''' The official [[flag of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field. 
 * '''''Coat of Arms:''''' After independence in 1992, North Macedonia kept the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946. 
 * '''''[[Vergina Flag (North Macedonia)|Vergina Sun]]:''''' (official flag, 1992–1995) The [[Vergina Sun]] is an ancient symbol and the emblem of macedonian empire. It used by several groups in the Macedonian [[diaspora]]. The Vergina Sun is believed to have been associated with kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II of macedon]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day of Macedonia. The Vergina sun on a red field was the first flag of the independent [[North Macedonia]], until it was removed from the state flag under an agreement reached between North Macedonia and Greece in September 1995. < ref > Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite news |volume=24|issue=2|year=1996 |work=Journal of Political and Military Sociology|pages=285|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11160801/name-conflict-conflict-name-analysis-greeces-dispute-fyrom | title= A name for a conflict or a conflict for a name?
