 '''Ljungby''' is an [[urban area]] in the [[counties of Sweden|county]] of [[Kronoberg County|Kronoberg]] in [[Sweden]]. It is the seat of [[Ljungby Municipality]]. In 2015 there lived 15,785 people in Ljungby. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:John Lundqvist Astrad och Götrad.JPG|left|thumb|Astrad and Götrad lived during the Viking Age and are the first persons from Ljungby that we know about. This is a statue that stands in Ljungby and is made by John Lundqvist.]] 
 
 === 11th century to 1828, before Ljugby became a town === 
 The first know persons to live in the area around Ljungby was Astrad and Götrad. Astrad and Götrad lived during the [[Viking Age]] in the 11th century. We know about them because Götrad made a [[runestone]], [[Småland Runic Inscription 35|The Replösa Stone]], for his dead father Astrad. 
 
 The first stone church was built in during the 12th century. It was built with the creation of Ljungby [[parish]]. 
 
 In the 14th century an [[inn]] was built in Ljungby by order of the king. They built it because Ljungby lies were two big [[trade route]]s cross. 
 
 During the 17th and 18th century the inn was owned by a woman named [[Märta Ljungberg]]. Märta Ljungberg earned a lot of money from the inn. She used some of the money to buy twelve other farms. The town of Ljungby would later be built on these twelve farms. 
 
 In the beginning of the 19th century there was a need of a town in [[Sunnerbo hundred]]. There were two places that would fit a town. One was [[Berga, Ljungby kommun|Berga]] and the other was Ljungby. Berga had got permission to form a town during the 13th century, but the town had never been formed. Ljungby was located more central in [[Sunnerbo hundred]] and had better road connections. In the end it was decided that the town should be built in Ljungby. 
 
 === 1828 to today, the town Ljungby === 
 Sometime between 1828 and 1830 the area known as Ljungby was made into a ''[[friköping]]''. A ''friköping'' is a type of smaller town, but it does not have the same [[town privileges]] as a formal town. The new town Ljungby was founded on the ground donated by Märta Ljungberg. 
 
 In 1878 the first railroad was built in Ljungby. The railroad went from [[Vislanda]], via Ljungby, to [[Bolmen]]. After some years it had been connected with other railroads and went to [[Karlshamn]] in east and to [[Halmstad]] in west. In 1899 the north-south railroad ''[[Skåne]]–[[Småland]]s Railroad'' opened. 
 
 During the 20th century Ljungby expanded with the help of workshops and wood industry. The biggest expansion was between 1940 and 1960. 
 
 In 1953, during the night between 4 July and 5 July, there was a big town fire in Ljungby. The fire had damaged twenty buildings. Thirty families became homeless and 96 persons lost their job. 
 
 In 1970 the ''Karlshamn–Vislanda–Bolmens Railroad'' was closed down. Less and less [[cargo]] was being transported by train and was instead replaced by [[Truck|lorries]]. 
 
 The last train in Ljungby passed in 1997 when the cargo route [[Helmershus]]-Ljungby ended. After the railroad was removed, much of the former tracks have been converted into [[bicycle path]]s. 
 
 The first [[college]] in Ljungby opened in 2002, [[Högskolecentrum Ljungby]]. It cooperates with the three nearby universities [[Linnaeus University]], [[Jönköping University]], and [[Halmstad University]].

 Ljungby have been the home of several cultural persons. Among others, the [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] [[Gunnar Fischer]] and the writers [[Folke Fridell]], [[Lennart Williams]], and [[Sölve Rydell]].
