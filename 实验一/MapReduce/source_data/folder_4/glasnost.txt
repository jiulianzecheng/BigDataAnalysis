 The word was often used by Gorbachev for policies he believed might reduce [[corruption]] at the top, and moderate the abuse of power by the [[Central Committee]]. Russian [[human rights]] activist and dissident [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]] explained glasnost as a word that  " had been in the Russian language for centuries. It was in the dictionaries and lawbooks as long as there had been dictionaries and lawbooks. It was an ordinary, hardworking, nondescript word that was used to refer to a process, any process of justice of governance, being conducted in the open " . < ref > Alexeyeva, Lyumila and Paul Goldberg 1990.

 Glasnost can also refer to the specific period in the history of the USSR during the 1980s when there was less [[censorship]] and greater freedom of information.
