'''Effervescence''' is the release of [[gas]] from a [[Solution|mixture]] where [[water]] dissolves another substance, and the foaming and fizzing that results from the release. 
 
 The most common gas that is released in effervescence is carbon dioxide, however nitrogen gas can be dissolved to produce smaller bubbles. 
 
 Effervescence can be seen when opening a bottle of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], [[beer]] or some [[soft drink]]s. The bubbles that can be seen are produced by the escape from the dissolved gas (which cannot be seen while dissolved in the liquid). < ref > {{Cite web|title=What Is the Definition of Effervescence in Chemistry?|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-effervescence-604435|access-date=2021-08-08|website=ThoughtCo|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 In the laboratory, a common example of effervescence is seen when [[hydrochloric acid]] is added to a block of [[limestone]]. If a few pieces of [[marble]] or an [[antacid tablet]] are put in hydrochloric acid in a [[test tube]] fitted with a [[Stopper (plug)|cork]], it is possible to see an effervescence of [[carbon dioxide]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2007-06-09|title=Chemistry Dictionary  &  Glossary|url=http://www.ktf-split.hr/glossary/en_o.php?def=effervescence|access-date=2021-08-08|archive-date=2007-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609160936/http://www.ktf-split.hr/glossary/en_o.php?def=effervescence|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >
