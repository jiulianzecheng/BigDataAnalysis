 '''Plankton''' are drifting [[organism]]s that live in the surface layers of the [[ocean]]. They live in the top layer of the ocean, called the [[Pelagic zone|epipelagic zone]]. They are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents. The term is in contrast to '''nekton''', who can control their movements. < ref > Thurman H.V. 1997. ''Introductory oceanography''. Prentice Hall, N.J. {{ISBN|0-13-262072-3}}. < /ref >  There are three groups: 
 * Phytoplankton: which live at the surface of the ocean and [[photosynthesis]]e (use light to make sugars and other [[molecule]]s).  
 ** Eukaryote [[algae]]: [[diatom]]s, [[coccolithophore]]s, some [[dinoflagellate]]s. 
 ** Bacteria: [[cyanobacteria]]. 
 * Zooplankton: small [[protozoa]]ns or [[metazoa]]ns: [[Ctenophore]]s; [[jellyfish]]; [[rotifer]]s; [[foraminifera]]; tiny [[crustacea]] and other [[animal]]s. Some [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[larva]]e of larger animals such as fish, crustaceans, and [[annelid]]s. Apart from the eggs, they all feed on other plankton.  
 * Some groups fall into both categories. [[Dinoflagellate]]s can be either photosynthetic producers or [[heterotroph]] consumers; many species are ''mixotrophic'' depending upon their circumstances. It is also hard to fit [[virus]]es into this scheme; yet they are present in great numbers. 
 
 Plankton are important in the ocean's [[food chain]]. They are the main source of food for almost all [[fish]] larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to catching [[Predation|prey]]. [[Basking shark]]s and [[blue whale]]s feed on them directly; other large fish feed on them indirectly, by eating fish of smaller size, such as [[herring]]s. 
 
 The distribution of plankton is governed more by nutrients than by temperature. Large tracts of ocean are blue and sterile. The reason is that these areas lack one or more crucial nutrients for the photosynthetic plankton, upon whom all the others depend. Broadly speaking, areas near land masses get nutrients by rivers and wind. The key [[nutrient]] lacking in the [[Pacific ocean]] is [[iron]], essential in [[molecule]]s such as ''ferredoxins'', iron-[[sulfur]] [[protein]]s which do [[electron]] transfer in a range of [[Metabolism|metabolic]] reactions.
