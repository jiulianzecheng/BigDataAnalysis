 '''Conscience''' is something that tells [[people]] if what they are doing is [[morality|right or wrong]]. Having it can make people [[sadness|sad]] about what they have done. It is the sense of the moral goodness or blameworthiness of one's own conduct, intentions, or character together with a feeling of obligation to do right or be good. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 Middle English (also in the sense ‘inner thoughts or knowledge’): via Old French from Latin conscientia, from conscient- ‘being privy to’, from the verb conscire, from con- ‘with’ + scire ‘know’.
