 '''Boron''' is a [[chemical element]]. It has the chemical symbol '''B'''. It has the [[atomic number]] 5. It is a [[metalloid]] (it has properties of a [[metal]] and a [[Nonmetal|non-metal]]). Much boron is found in [[chemical compound]]s in its ore [[borax]]. Boron is never found free in nature.

 Two types of boron are found ([[allotrope]]s). [[Amorphous]] boron is a brown powder and metallic ([[crystal]]line) boron is black and hard and a weak [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] at [[room temperature]]. Boron is the 5th element in the [[periodic table]] and is part of the Earth's surface. 
 Pure boron is used as a [[dopant]] (a [[substance]] added to [[semiconductor]]s to change how it behaves with [[electricity]]) in the [[semiconductor]] [[industry]]. [[Chemical compounds]] of boron are important as to make strong materials not weigh very much, as [[nontoxic]] [[insecticide]]s and [[preservative]]s, and for [[chemical synthesis]]. 
 
 [[Plant]]s need boron in them to live. Very small amounts of boron are needed in [[animal]]'s bodies so that they are very [[health]]y. How it keeps animals healthy is not known in detail.  
 
 Boron was discovered by Sir [[Humphry Davy]], an English chemist, in 1808. 
 
 Boron melts at 2075 & nbsp;째C (3767 & nbsp;째F), and boils at 4000 & nbsp;째C (7232 & nbsp;째F).
