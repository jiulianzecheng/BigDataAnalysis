 ==Gameplay== 
 
 The game starts the player off inside of a room with a door that needs a heart to be opened and upon exploring the room, the player will find a key under a table which is then used to open a wardrobe later on. Once the wardrobe is opened, it will then reveal a hidden hallway in which will be used to progress the game further on. The horror game isn't like any other horror game but instead deceives the player by creating files, showing a fake blue screen of death, closing the game, and much more.
