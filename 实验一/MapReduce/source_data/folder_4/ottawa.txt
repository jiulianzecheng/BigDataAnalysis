 '''Ottawa''' is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of [[Canada]] and is part of the [[province]] of [[Ontario]]. It is south of the [[Ottawa River]]. In 2004, there were about 808,391 people in the city. The region has about 1,146,790 people. The mayor of the city today (since December 2010) is Jim Watson. Ottawa is in the [[Ottawa Valley]] on the border with the province of [[Quebec]] which is divided by the Ottawa River. Ottawa is the fourth largest city in Canada and the second largest city in Ontario (after [[Toronto]]). Ottawa is the only officially [[bilingual]] city in Canada, where the [[English language]] and the [[French language]] are [[official language]]s and have equal status. Every official sign in the city is, as a result bilingual. The reason for this bilingual status, is not only because Ottawa borders the French-speaking province of Quebec, the city itself has a large French-speaking minority. 
 
 When people talk about Ottawa, they are sometimes using the name as an [[eponym]] meaning the highest government in Canada, and not its local government or the city. 
 
 The cities of Ottawa, [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]], [[Nepean, Ontario|Nepean]], [[Gloucester, Ontario|Gloucester]] and [[Vanier, Ontario|Vanier]] and the villages of [[Manotick, Ontario|Manotick]] and [[Rockcliffe Park, Ontario|Rockcliffe Park]] joined in the year [[2000]] to form the new city of Ottawa. Ottawa also includes [[Orleans, Ontario|Orléans]], which joined at that same time. 
 
 The city began with the name Bytown and became the city of Ottawa in 1855. The [[Rideau Canal]] ends in Ottawa. 
 
 Ottawa has many museums, many buildings for the government of Canada and many parks. There is a market area downtown. 
 
 There are many festivals during the year including Winterlude in February, The Tulip Festival in May, and BluesFest in the summer. There is also a large celebration on July 1st for [[Canada Day]]. 
 
 The [[Ottawa Senators]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) play ice hockey in an arena called [[Canadian Tire Centre]]. The [[Ottawa Redblacks]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also play in the city.
