'''Poleyembryony''' is when one fertilized egg becomes more than one embryo.  Animals and plants can both do polyembryony. 
 
 Most mammals can have twins or triplets, but this is not what usually happens. It happens more often in other living things, for example [[citrus]] trees, [[parasitoid]] [[Wasp|wasps]], certain [[Flatworm|flatworms]] and various aquatic [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]]. < ref name=SD > {{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/polyembryony|title=Polyembryony - Overview|publisher=Science Direct|accessdate=June 7, 2021}} < /ref >
