 An '''ammeter''' is a measuring tool used to measure the flow of [[electric current]] in a circuit. The electric current is measured in [[ampere]]s; for this reason, some people call the ammeters as ''ampmeters'', by mistake. It can measure 'resistance' of a current, speed of a current and force of a current (the units used are ohms, amperes, and volts) Ammeters are connected in series in a circuit with two connections.
