 An '''anglerfish''' is a  marine [[fish]] that belongs to the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Lophiiformes'''. Anglerfish are noted for having a [[bait]]-like [[appendage]] in front of their [[head]]s, right above their mouths. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/anglerfish.html |title=Anglerfish, Anglerfish pictures, Anglerfish facts - National Geographic |work=animals.nationalgeographic.com |year=2011 |access-date=February 4, 2011}} < /ref >   
 
 The appendage, which resembles a [[fishing pole]], is attached to the end of the [[dorsal fin]]'s front [[spine]], which is separated from the rest of the [[fin]]. Anglerfish light their rod with [[bioluminescence]] (their own light) and then [[wikt:wiggle|wiggle]] it to [[wikt:mimic|mimic]] a small marine animal. When other creatures come to eat the small marine animal, the anglerfish eats them. They are called anglerfish because they catch fish with bait, just like [[Fishing#Fishing for fun|anglers]], who use a rod and line (rather than nets). 
 
 One of the families, the [[Ceratiidae]], has an extraordinary [[mating system]] where the male actually fuses into the female. 
 
 ==Evolution== 
 A [[mitochondria]]l [[genome]] [[Phylogeny|phylogenetic]] study suggested that anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the  [[Lower Cretaceous]], between 130 and 100 million years ago. < ref name= " Miya2010 " >  Miya M.''et al.'' 2010.
