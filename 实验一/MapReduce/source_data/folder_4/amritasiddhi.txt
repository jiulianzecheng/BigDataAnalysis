{{short description|Early text on haṭha yoga}}The '''''Amṛtasiddhi''''', written in a [[Buddhist]] environment in about the 11th century. The implied model is that bindu is constantly lost from its store in the head, leading to death, but that it can be preserved by means of yogic practices. The text has Buddhist features, and makes use of metaphors from [[alchemy]]. 
 
 == Buddhist features == 
 A primary{{sfn|Mallinson|Szántó|2021|p=107}} Buddhist feature is the opening verse praising the [[goddess]] Chinnamasta:{{sfn|Mallinson|2018}} Amṛtasiddhi 7.7 speaks of the effects of transforming Bindu, as if alchemically transforming mercury, with the terms  " thickened "  (''mūrcchitaḥ''),  " fixed "  (''baddha''),  " dissolved "  (''līna''), and  " still "  (''niścala''). The verse is parallelled by many later Hatha yoga texts and in Tantra by the ''[[Hevajra|Hevajratantra]]''.{{sfn|Mallinson|Szántó|2021|pp=21, 119}}{{sfn|Grimes|2020}}
