 == History of Gliwice == 
 In the late [[Middle Ages]], around 1276, was the first known time that there was a reference to Gliwice in [[history]].  At first, it was ruled by [[Poland|Polish]] [[dukes]], but later became a part of [[Bohemia]] in 1335.  Later on, in 1526, it was conquered by [[Austria]]. 
 
 In the middle of the 18th century, Gliwice was taken from the Austrian ruling family and became a part of [[Prussia]].  However, in the unification, or coming together, of [[Germany]] in 1871, Gliwice became a part of the German [[empire]]. 
 
 In the 19th century, Gliwice became more developed and was home to many businesses, including one of the most famous theaters in [[Germany]] at the time. 
 
 In 1945, Gliwice passed into Polish rule.
