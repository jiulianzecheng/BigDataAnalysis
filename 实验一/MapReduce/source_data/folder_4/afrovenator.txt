 '''''Afrovenator''''' was a [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the  [[Middle Jurassic]] of northern [[Africa]]. It was a [[bipedal]] meat-eating [[predator]] with long bladelike teeth.  Fossils have been found in Abaka, [[Niger]] in the southern [[Sahara|Sahara desert]]. A nearly complete ''Afrovenator'' was found in 1993. It is one of the most complete dinosaurs found in [[Africa]] so far. < ref name= " Sereno1994 " > Sereno P.C. ''et al'' 1994. Early Cretaceous dinosaurs from the Sahara.

 The rocks where it was found were redescribed as  " mid-Jurassic "  after the discovery had been announced. < ref name=rauhut2009 > Rauhut and Lopez-Arbarello 2009.

 It is in a group of theropods which are known as the [[Megalosauridae|Megalosaur]]s.
