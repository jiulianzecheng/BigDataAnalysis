 A '''subsidiary''' is a [[company]] that is controlled by its parent company. Even though a subsidiary works on its own, and its purposes are ''different'' from that of its parent company, the parent company is in control of its subsidiary. 
 
 A company's subsidiary is different from a company's [[division]] because a division works ''together'' with its parent company. A division's goal is usually similar to that of its parent company, and the division has to use its parent company's name. A subsidiary can use a name different from that of its parent company. 
 
 For example, [[YouTube]] is a ''subsidiary'' of [[Google]], because Google is a [[search engine]], while YouTube is a [[video sharing]] [[website]]. [[Google Videos]] is a ''division'' of Google, because Google Videos is a search engine that searches videos on the Internet. This is to match its parent company Google as a search engine. Also, YouTube has an entirely different name and [[logo]] from Google's, while Google Videos, as a division, must use Google's name and logo.
