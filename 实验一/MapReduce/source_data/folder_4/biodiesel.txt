 '''Biodiesel''' is a type of [[fuel]] prepared by changing [[vegetable oil]], animal fat, special types of [[algae]] and possibly even [[sewage]].  It is considered a type of [[renewable energy]], since it all comes from living plants and animals.  It can be used to power an engine, usually for [[vehicle]]s, including [[airplane]]s.  It replaces [[diesel]] that comes from [[petroleum]], a type of [[fossil fuel]].   < ref > {{cite web|title=Intro to Biodiesel|url=http://www.biodiesel.org/|publisher=Biodiesel.org|accessdate=15 April 2013}} < /ref >   
 
 [[Biogas|Biofuel]] prepared from [[biomass]] is different since it does not start from oil and uses a different [[chemical]] process to make the fuel. 
 
 ==Advantages and disadvantages== 
 Biodiesel is much cleaner and has less [[pollution]] than diesel fuel made from fossil fuels.  It also acts as a solvent (like soap). In fact, it cleans the engine so much that it might pull out old dirt in the engine and clog up the filters.  After the filters are replaced then it is fine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}} 
 
 In the [[United States]] and several other places, new laws say that regular diesel fuel must be low in sulfur.  This gets rid of pollution, especially [[acid rain]], but it also makes the fuel less slippery.  Adding in biodiesel helps keep the fuel slippery and the engine running smoothly. < ref > {{cite web|title=Biodiesel advantages and considerations|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/biodiesel_benefits.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=15 April 2013}} < /ref >   
 
 Most biodiesel comes from plants. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Biomass to Diesel: A Sustainable Alternative to Fossil Fuels |url=https://whatsbiomass.com/biomass-to-diesel-alternative-to-fossil-fuels/ |website=WhatsBiomass |access-date=2023-02-10 |archive-date=2023-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230320135208/https://whatsbiomass.com/biomass-to-diesel-alternative-to-fossil-fuels/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   This means a lot of farmland is used to grow plants for fuel instead of for feeding animals and people.  There are scientists, [[chemical engineering|chemical engineers]] and [[agricultural]] engineers who are studying ways to use algae and saltwater plants to make oil.  This would not take away farmland that is used to grow food.  Also, some biodiesel comes from waste oil and waste animal fat, that would otherwise be thrown away.  [[NASA]] is testing biodiesel made from chicken fat to fuel their airplanes. < ref > {{cite web|title=Jets fly on chicken fat|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/aafex2.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=15 April 2013}} < /ref >   
 
 All diesel fuel has a problem starting an engine in cold weather, but biodiesel has more of a problem.  This can be solved by mixing biodiesel and regular diesel at the right [[wikt:mixture|mixture]].  Or by heating the fuel before it is used by the engine.  There might be a heater built into the vehicle for this. < ref > {{cite web|title=Cold weather problems|url=http://www.home-made-biodiesel.com/biodiesel-cold-weather.html#.UWt07o5qLOE|publisher=Home-made Biodiesel|accessdate=15 April 2013|archive-date=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303092638/http://www.home-made-biodiesel.com/biodiesel-cold-weather.html#.UWt07o5qLOE|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Biodiesel from plants== 
 Most biodiesel is made from [[oilseed]].  Oilseed is any type of seed that has enough oil in it to be useful in making vegetable oil.   
 
 In Brazil, castor beans are the best plants to make biodiesel. 
 In Germany biodiesel is usually made from rapeseeds. 
 [[Soy bean|Soybeans]] and [[sunflower|sunflower seeds]] are commonly used in the United States. 
 In Thailand, the raw material will most likely come from [[palm tree|palm]] oil, [[coconut]] oil, [[Jatropha]] oil, and animal fat. 
 Jatropha trees also grow in India and Africa.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}} 
 
 Some people make their own biodiesel by converting old oil that is used in restaurants to fry foods.  The exhaust smells a bit like french fries. < ref > {{cite web|title=Biodiesel, smells like french fries|url=http://engineering.illinois.edu/news/2011/02/16/smells-french-fries|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=15 April 2013|archive-date=6 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606062249/https://engineering.illinois.edu/news/2011/02/16/smells-french-fries|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 ==Biodiesel from algae== 
 Someday [[algae]] might be used to make more biodiesel than is made today with vegetable oil.  Algae can be grown in places that food cannot be grown in, so it would not take food away from people.   < ref > {{cite web|title=Uses of algae|url=http://www.oilgae.com/algae/use/use.html|publisher=oilgae|accessdate=15 April 2013}} < /ref >  But right now it is still too expensive, but scientists are looking at ways to make the process better. < ref > {{cite web|title=Oil extraction from algae (not a simple-english source)|url=http://www.oilgae.com/algae/oil/extract/extract.html|publisher=Oilgae|accessdate=15 April 2013}} < /ref >
