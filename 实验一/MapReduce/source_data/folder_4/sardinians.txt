 '''Sardinians''' ([[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: ''Sardos'' or ''Sardus''; {{lang-it|Sardi}}) are the people native to the island of [[Sardinia]], an autonomous region of [[Italy]]. 
 
 Sardinians are noted for the distinct Nuragic civilization in ancient times. They are also known for the indigenous language many still speak, Sardinian. Sardinian is quite separate from [[Italian language|Italian]] and said to be one of the languages, if not the language, keeping most archaic features of ancient [[Latin language|Latin]]. Sardinians have long been active to fight for the official recognition of autonomy in Italy and the protection of their cultural and environmental heritage.
