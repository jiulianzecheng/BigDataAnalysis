'''Antinatalism''', or '''anti-natalism''', is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] stance and social movement that gives a negative [[value (ethics)|value]] to [[Birth|starting life]]. Antinatalists argue that humans (and sometimes other [[sentience|sentient beings]]) should stop making kids because it is [[morality|morally]] [[evil|bad]]. People who believe that making kids is morally good are called natalists. The term antinatalism was likely used for the first time by Belgian author [[Théophile de Giraud]] in his book ''L'art de guillotiner les procréateurs: Manifeste anti-nataliste''. South African philosopher [[David Benatar]] has also published books in support of antinatalism. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change|title=I wish I'd never been born: the rise of the anti-natalists|author=Tuhus-Dubrow, Rebecca|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 November 2019|access-date=23 November 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 == Arguments == 
 '''Negative Utilitarianism''' is the idea that stopping pain is more important than making people happy. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=NARVESON|first=JAN|date=1967|title=V.—UTILITARIANISM AND NEW GENERATIONS|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/lxxvi.301.62|journal=Mind|volume=LXXVI|issue=301|pages=62–72|doi=10.1093/mind/lxxvi.301.62|issn=0026-4423}} < /ref >  This makes it different from [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarianism is the idea that people should do the most useful thing. The most useful thing in utilitarianism is making people happy. People who believe in negative utilitarianism idea say that making happiness is not needed. Since life has bad things, it is not worth starting. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Vetter|first=Hermann|date=January 1969|title=IV.

This makes life not worth starting because it is too [[Risk|risky]]. 
 
 '''Realism''' can support antinatalism. This is because [[Supporter|supporters]] of the [[idea]] have [[evidence]] showing that most people have an [[Optimism|optimism bias]]. This means that they see the world as better than it actually is. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Optimistic bias: What you think, what you know, or whom you know?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286894666|access-date=2021-01-22|website=ResearchGate|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Neil D.|date=1980|title=Unrealistic optimism about future life events|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-personality-and-social-psychology_1980-11_39_5/page/806|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=5|pages=806–820|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.806|citeseerx=10.1.1.535.9244}} < /ref > 
 
 '''Religion''' can support antinatalism. This is because some religious sects (groups) believe creating life traps souls in a bad world.
