 Before it was called Germany, it was called Germania. In the years A.D. 900 – 1806, Germany was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From 1949 to 1990, Germany was made up of two countries called the Federal Republic of Germany ([[West Germany]]) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). During this time, the capital city of [[Berlin]] was divided into a west and an east part. On 13 August 1961, [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] started building the [[Berlin Wall]] between the two parts of Berlin. West Germany was one of the countries that started the [[European Union]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1945-1959/1957/index_en.htm. |title=History of the European Union |accessdate=20 March 2012 |publisher=European Union }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >

 Germany gained importance as the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of the German Nation, which was the first ''Reich'' (this word means ''empire'').

 During the mid-1800s, [[Prussia]] was led by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], who is sometimes known as the  " Father of Germany " . He led a process to bring the German people together under one country. In 1866, Prussia won a war against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and their allies. During this time, Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]]. The treaty of [[unification of Germany]] was made in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] after Germany won the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871. < ref name= " timetable " > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=A timeline of German – The second German empire|url=http://www.stefanjacob.de/Geschichte/Unterseiten/Zeittafel.php?Intern=5 & PHPSESSID=b90e60702ee906731aa362b243a99d20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501110725/http://www.stefanjacob.de/Geschichte/Unterseiten/Zeittafel.php?Intern=5 & PHPSESSID=b90e60702ee906731aa362b243a99d20|archive-date=1 May 2006|accessdate=20 March 2012|website=|language=German}} < /ref >  This began the Second Reich.

 Hitler wanted to unify all Germans in one state and did this by [[Annexation|taking over]] places where Germans lived, such as [[Austria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]; Hitler also wanted the land in Poland that Germany had owned before 1918, but Poland refused to give it to him. He then invaded Poland. This started [[World War II]] on 1 September 1939. In the beginning of the war, Germany was winning and even successfully invaded France. It managed to take over much of Europe. However, Germany attacked the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941 and after the [[Battle of Kursk]], the German Eastern Front began a slow retreat until war's end. On 8 May 1945, Germany gave up after Berlin was captured, Hitler had killed himself a week earlier. Because of the war, Germany lost a lot of German land east of [[Oder-Neisse line|the Oder-Neiße line]], and for 45 years, Germany was split into West Germany and [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]]. Other events happened during the war in Nazi Germany, including [[the Holocaust]], the mass [[genocide]] of Jews and other peoples, for which some Nazis were punished in the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. 
 
 After [[World War II]] Germany was [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupied by the allies]] and in 1949 it was divided into 2 states: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], who were stuck in the [[Cold War]]. The capital city of [[Berlin]] was divided between the two by the [[Berlin Wall]]. 
 
 In 1989 there was a process of [[reform]]s in East Germany, which lead to the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]] and to the end of socialist rule in Germany. These events are known as the ''[[Wende]]'' or the ''Friedliche Revolution'' (Peaceful Revolution) in Germany.

 == Geography == 
 [[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Topographic map]] 
 Germany is one of the largest countries in Europe. It stretches from the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] in the north to the high mountains of the [[Alps]] in the south. The highest point is the [[Zugspitze]] on the Austrian [[border]], at {{convert|2962|m|ft}}. < ref name= " de-book " / > 
 
 Germany's northern part is very low and flat (lowest point: [[Neuendorf-Sachsenbande]] at {{convert|-3.54|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). In the middle, there are low mountain ranges covered in large forests. Between these and the Alps, there is another plain created by [[glacier]]s during the [[ice age]]s. 
 
 Germany also contains parts of Europe's longest rivers, such as the [[Rhine]] (which makes up a part of Germany's western border, while [[Oder River]] is on its eastern border), the [[Danube]] and the [[Elbe]]. < ref name= " de-book " / >

 ==Climate== 
 
 Germany has a mostly [[continental climate]], but the northern German coast has an [[oceanic climate]].

 Nearly all German companies are small- or medium-sized. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == People == 
 [[File:Castle Neuschwanstein.jpg|thumbnail|[[Neuschwanstein Castle]]]] 
 Most of the people in Germany are ethnically [[Germans]], but the country also has many [[ethnic minorities]]. There are at least seven million people from other countries living in Germany. Some have [[political asylum]], and some are [[guest worker]]s (''Gastarbeiter''). Many people from poor or dangerous countries go to Germany for safety. Many others move to Germany without permission. 
 
 About 50,000 ethnic Danish people live in Schleswig-Holstein, in the north. About 60,000 [[Sorbs]] (a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people) live in Germany too, in [[Saxony]] and [[Brandenburg]]. About 12,000 people in Germany speak [[Frisian]]; this language is the closest language to English that is still spoken today. In northern Germany, people outside towns speak [[Low Saxon]]. 
 
 Most of the people who have come to Germany are from [[Turkey]]. Germany has about 1.9 million [[Turks in Germany|Turkish]] immigrants and they own many businesses there. [[Turkish people]] introduced the [[Doner kebab]] and became a popular fast food in Germany. Other small groups of people in Germany are [[Croatia|Croats]] (0.2 million), [[Italy|Italians]] (0.6 million), Greeks (0.4 million), Russians, and [[Poland|Poles]] (0.3 million). There are also some ethnic Germans who lived in the old Soviet Union (1.7 million), Poland (0.7 million), and [[Romania]] (0.3 million). These people have German [[passport]]s, so they are not counted as foreigners. A lot of these people do not speak German at home. < ref name= " de-book "  / > 
 
 Christianity is the biggest religion; [[Protestant]]s are 38% of the people (mostly in the north) and [[Catholicism|Catholics]] are 34% of the people (mostly in the south). < ref name= " de-book " / >  There are also many [[Muslims]], while the other people (26.3%) are either not religious, or belong to smaller religious groups. < ref name= " de-book " / >  In the eastern regions, the former territory of the [[GDR]] (known as the ''DDR'' in German), only one fifth of the population is religious. 
 
 Germany has one of the world's highest levels of schooling, technology, and businesses. The number of young people who attend universities is now three times more than it was after the end of World War II, and the [[trade school|trade]] and [[technical school]]s of Germany are some of the best in the world. German income is, on average, $25,000 a year, making Germany a highly middle class society. A large [[social welfare]] system gives people money when they are ill, unemployed, or similarly disadvantaged. Millions of Germans travel outside of their country each year. 
 
 == Immigration == 
 Germany is a very densely populated country, and especially in cities the housing situation is difficult and rents are high. Already in 2014 there were 39,000 [[Homelessness|homeless people]] in Germany and 339,000 people without an apartment. < ref > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Zahl der Wohungslosen|url=http://www.bag-wohnungslosenhilfe.de/de/themen/zahl_der_wohnungslosen/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207153636/http://www.bag-wohnungslosenhilfe.de/de/themen/zahl_der_wohnungslosen/|archive-date=7 December 2013|accessdate=26 November 2016|website=|publisher=BAG Wohungslosenhilfe e.V.|language=German}} < /ref >  Here is a link to a German video report < ref > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Video:  " Flüchtlinge müssen länger in Sporthallen bleiben " |url=http://www.spiegel.de/video/fluechtlinge-in-berlin-muessen-laenger-in-sporthallen-bleiben-video-1723388.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128100937/http://www.spiegel.de/video/fluechtlinge-in-berlin-muessen-laenger-in-sporthallen-bleiben-video-1723388.html|archive-date=28 November 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016|website=|publisher=Spiegel Online}} < /ref >  from a German news magazine. The video is about refugees, who have been living in a sports gym in Berlin for over a year with no privacy. In the video people discuss amongst others why there are problems to find living space in containers. The containers are similar to those in [[Zaatari refugee camp]]. 
 
 == Religion == 
 [[File:Colognecathedralatnight.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Cologne Cathedral]] at the [[Rhine]] river is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]] 
 [[File:Frauenkirche interior 2008 001-Frauenkirche interior 2008 009.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) in [[Dresden]]]] 
 Germany's constitution says that all people can believe in any religion they want to, and that no one is allowed to discriminate against somebody because of the person's religion. 
 
 In ancient times, Germany was largely [[Germanic paganism|pagan]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] was the biggest religion in Germany up to the 15th century, but a major religious change called the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed this. In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] said that the Catholic Church used religion to make money. Luther started [[Protestant]]ism, which is as big as the Catholic religion in Germany today. Before World War II, about two-thirds of the German people were Protestant and one-thirds were Roman Catholic. In the north and northeast of Germany, there were a lot more Protestants than Catholics. Today, about two-thirds of German people (more than 55 million people) call themselves Christian, but most of them do not practice it. About half of them are Protestants and about half are Roman Catholics. < ref name= " cia " > {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html|title=CIA Factbook: Germany|accessdate=1 September 2009|archive-date=11 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211075204/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Most German Protestants are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. The previous Pope, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], was born in Germany. 
 
 Before World War II, about one percent of the country's people were [[German Jews]]. Today, Germany has the fastest-growing group of [[Jewish]] people in the world. Many of them are in Berlin. Ten thousand Jews have moved to Germany since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]; many came from countries that were in the Soviet Union. Schools teaching about the things that happened when the Nazis were in power, as well as teaching against the ideas of the Nazis, has helped to make Germany very [[Toleration|tolerant]] towards other people and cultures, and now many people move there from countries that may not be so tolerant. 
 
 About three million [[Muslim]]s live in Germany, 3.7% of the total population. < ref name= " cia " / > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ilaam.net/Intl/PopStats.html |title=Ilaam.net |accessdate=18 May 2009 |archive-date=8 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008191040/http://www.ilaam.net/Intl/PopStats.html |url-status=live }} < /ref >  The country also has a large [[Atheism|atheist]] and agnostic population, and there are also large about 0.6 million [[Hinduism]] follower and some small group of Jain, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities. The 20th century has also seen a [[Germanic neopaganism|neopagan]] revival. 
 
 == Culture == 
 [[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827), composer

 [[File:Franz Marc 003.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|''Blaues Pferd I'' (''Blue Horse I''), 1911 by [[Franz Marc]] (1880–1916)]] 
 Germany has a long history of poets, thinkers, and artists. There are 240 supported theaters, hundreds of orchestras, thousands of museums and over 25,000 [[library|libraries]] in Germany. Millions of tourists visit these attractions every year. Some of the greatest classical musicians including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and possibly [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] were German. Some of the most revered scientists today like [[Albert Einstein]] are German. 
 
 Germany has created a high level of gender equality, disability rights, and accepts homosexuality. [[Gay marriage]] has been legal in Germany since 2017. 
 
 === Food === 
 [[Doner kebab]] is often considered a popular German-Turkish fast food. But more traditional foods of German cuisine are [[sausage]] based such as [[Bratwurst]] and [[Currywurst]]. German food varies from region to region. For example, in the southern regions, such as [[Bavaria]] and [[Baden-Württemberg]], they share their type of food with [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. Everywhere in Germany, meat is eaten as a sausage. Even though wine use is increasing, the national alcoholic drink is beer. The number of Germans who drink [[beer]] is one of the highest in the world. German restaurants are often rated the second-best, with [[France]] rated first place. 
 
 === Sports === 
 [[File:Signal iduna park stadium dortmund 6.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Signal Iduna Park]] is the biggest [[Association football|football]] stadium in Germany.]] 
 Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team|national team]] has won the [[FIFA World Cup]] 4 times, and appears in the finals a lot. The top football league in Germany is [[Bundesliga]]. Also, the [[German Football Association]] (''Deutscher Fußball-Bund'') is the largest in the world. A lot of big football teams are from Germany, like [[FC Bayern Munich]], [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[RB Leipzig]] and many others. Some of the world's best [[footballer]]s come from Germany too. These would include [[Mesut Özil]], [[Manuel Neuer]], [[Serdar Tasci]], [[Michael Ballack]], [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]], and so on. Plus, many tournaments have taken place in Germany. The most recent was the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. The [[Audi Cup]] takes place in Germany every year in [[Munich]]. 
 
 Germany is also known for its motor sports. Successful German racing drivers include [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Sebastian Vettel]]. 
 
 Successful [[tennis]] players have also come from Germany, including [[Steffi Graf]] and [[Boris Becker]]. More recently, [[Sabine Lisicki]] reached the Women's Singles final at Wimbledon in 2013. 
 
 Lastly, Germany is one of the best countries in the [[Olympic Games]]. Germany is the third in the list of the most Olympic Games medals in history (mixed with [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]] medals). The country finished first place in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], second place in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. Germany also got fifth place in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].
