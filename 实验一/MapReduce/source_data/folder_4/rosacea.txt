 '''Rosacea''' is a chronic facial condition that is characterized through acne and redness. It can happen to people of any age. It gets worse if left untreated. There are four types of rosacea, three involving human [[skin]] and the fourth affecting eyes. 
 
 Rosacea affects mostly [[Caucasian]]s, though some other races can be affected. Rosacea affects both males and females. Females are three times more likely than males to get rosacea. Things that can cause rosacea are exposure of the face to extreme [[temperature]], the heat of sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, anxiety, [[alcohol]] and spicy foods. Most people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never officially diagnosed or treated.
