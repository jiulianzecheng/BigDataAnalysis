 '''Xylem''' is a [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in [[vascular plant]] < nowiki/ > s. Its [[cell]]s have thick, hard walls. Xylem tissue dies soon after it is formed and is the [[wood]] in the middle of a tree. The dead cells are like [[Pipe (material)|pipes]], hollow and rigid. 
 
 Xylem is one of two tissues in the plant which [[transportation|transport]] substances that plants need to live. Substances that xylem transports include water and minerals obtained through the plant's roots, as xylem runs from the [[root]]s to the [[Plant stem|stems]] and [[leaf|leaves]]. The other transport tissue is the [[phloem]], which transports energy in the form of [[sugar]] (as well as any other chemicals) from the leaves to the rest of the plant. 
 
 Xylem [[cell]]s are present in all parts of a plant, in stems, roots, and leaves. Water is carried against [[gravity]] by the negative pressure that builds up through the process of [[transpiration]], which is the evaporation of moisture in leaves. 
 
 Xylem consists of four types of cells: 
 
 # Xylem parenchyma which are living cells with thin walls 
 # Xylem fibres 
 # [[Tracheids]] 
 # [[Xylem vessels]] 
 
 Most of these cells are dead cells and have thick walls.
