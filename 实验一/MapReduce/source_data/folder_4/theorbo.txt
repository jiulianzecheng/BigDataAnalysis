 The '''theorbo''' is a [[musical instrument]]. It is a [[lute]] with a longer neck. It is played by plucking the [[String (music)|strings]] with one hand. Another hand presses the strings. This changes the [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. It has an extra set of bass strings. This gives the theorbo a bigger range of notes to play. It was used to play [[basso continuo]] parts in the [[baroque music|baroque period]]. It was also played as a solo instrument.
