{{Greek alphabet|letter=epsilon}} 
 '''Epsilon''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Ε ε'''), is the letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used to represent the  " e "  sound in [[Ancient Greek|Ancient]] and [[Modern Greek language|Modern]] Greek. In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of 5. Letters that came from it include the Roman [[E]] and Cyrillic [[Е]]. It is also used in [[calculus]] to represent a very small number (particularly in proofs involving [[Limit of a function|limit]]). In [[set theory]], a typographical variant of epsilon can be used to represent the statement  " a is a member of set A "  (symbolically  < math > a \in A < /math > ). < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-18|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 (A little fact: The Ypsilon is the only letter of the alphabet that you can divide into syllables: Y-psi-lon)
