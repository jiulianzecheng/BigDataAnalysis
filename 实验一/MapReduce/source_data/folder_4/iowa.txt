 ==Geography== 
 [[File:Iowa topography.jpg|thumb|250px|left|{{center|Iowa's counties and major streams.}}]] Iowa is in the [[Midwestern United States]]. To the north of Iowa is [[Minnesota]]; to the west are [[Nebraska]] and [[South Dakota]]; to the south is [[Missouri]]; and to the east are [[Illinois]] and [[Wisconsin]]. 
 
 The eastern [[border]] of the state is marked by the [[Mississippi River]] which runs between Iowa and Illinois. The western border is marked by the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Big Sioux River|Big Sioux]] rivers. The northern border is a line 43 degrees, 30 & nbsp;minutes north [[latitude]]. The southern border follows the northern border of Missouri. < ref group=note > Iowa’s borders are [[definition|defined]] in the Preamble to the [http://www.legis.state.ia.us/Constitution.html#pre1 state Constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802085648/http://www.legis.state.ia.us/Constitution.html#pre1 |date=2009-08-02 }}. The Missouri and Mississippi river boundaries are as they were mapped in the 19th century, which can be different than their modern [[wikt:course|courses]]. < /ref >  Iowa and Missouri disagreed about the location of the Iowa-Missouri border. This argument was ended by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the 1896 case, ''State of Missouri v. State of Iowa'', < ref > [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/48/660/case.html ''State of Missouri v. State of Iowa''], 48 U.S. (7 How.) 688 (1896). < /ref >  after a standoff called the [[Honey War]]. < ref > {{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Morrison|title=Forty-Thirty-five or fight?
