 '''Gibraltar''' is an [[List of dependent territories|Overseas Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. This means it shares the [[British]] [[King]] or [[Queen]] and has the protection of the [[British Armed Forces]]. It is in southwest [[Europe]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. About 32,000 people live there. They are called Gibraltarians. 
 
 Gibraltar has always been important as a military base because this is where the Mediterranean Sea narrows to only 14 & nbsp;kilometres (9 & nbsp;miles) at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. This meant that whichever country controlled Gibraltar could see all ships that came into the Mediterranean Sea. 
 
 Gibraltar is most famous for ''The Rock of Gibraltar'', a 426 & nbsp;meter high [[limestone]] rock rising out of the sea. The rock can be seen for many miles. It is home to the ''Barbary Apes'', a type of tail-less [[macaque]] which are the only wild [[monkey]]s in [[Europe]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Gibraltar was named for a general who led the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]. It belonged to [[Spain]] between the years [[1501]] and [[1704]], and it was captured by a group of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[British]] [[Marine (military)|marine]]s during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1704). In [[1713]], Spain signed the ''Treaty of Utrecht''. This [[treaty]] ended the war and said Gibraltar would be British permanently. However, according to this treaty, if the Crown of Great Britain ever wants to leave the territory, the Crown of Spain will have a prior position in order to claim the sovereignty. 
 
 Ever since then, Spain has tried to get Gibraltar back. They [[siege|attacked]] the Rock several times in the 18th century. 
 However, since the 1950s, Spain has tried get Gibraltar by diplomacy (international relations) by putting different kinds of pressure and restrictions on the people of Gibraltar. < ref > {{cite book| author = William Godfrey Fothergill Jackson| title = The Rock of the Gibraltarians: A History of Gibraltar| year = 1990| publisher = Ashford PressPub| isbn = 978-0-948466-14-4 }} < /ref > 
 
 Gibraltar was very important in [[World War II]]. Since it was in such a good position, it was the perfect place for the British army and navy to have its base. In World War II the people living in Gibraltar were taken to different parts of the world like [[Jamaica]] so they could be protected from the war and also leave the Rock for the soldiers. The Rock of Gibraltar was used by these soldiers, and long tunnels were made inside it. These tunnels even had a hospital and living areas for the soldiers. 
 
 In [[1969]] Britain gave Gibraltar a new [[constitution]]. This meant that it gave the people of Gibraltar a large amount of self-government. 
 
 In [[2002]] the people of Gibraltar were asked to [[vote]] whether they wanted Spain to share Gibraltar with the [[United Kingdom]]; almost everyone voted and 98.97% said they did not. 
 
 In [[2006]] Gibraltar voted to approve a new constitution which gave full self-government to the people meaning they can independently create their own laws. 
 
 In 2006, Spain signed a deal to stop interfering with Gibraltar telephone lines, and daily flights to Madrid started. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVJ-OhMrA-0C & dq=gibraltar+telephone+cordoba+accord & pg=PA1502|title=QFINANCE: The Ultimate Resource|last=|first=|date=2012-06-01|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84930-046-9|location=|pages=1502|language=en}} < /ref >
