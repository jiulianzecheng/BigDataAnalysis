 '''Kottabos''' ({{lang-grc|κότταβος}}) was a party game played at [[symposium|symposia]] in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was popular in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. It was also popular with the Etruscans. The game is played by flinging a bit of wine from one's cup at targets. The player would utter the name of his lover. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=166498 & img=141685 |title=99/117/1 Drinking cup (kylix), red-figure style, glazed terracotta, attributed to the Antiphon Painter, Athens, Greece, c. 490–480 BCE – Powerhouse Museum Collection < !-- Bot generated title -- >  |access-date=2012-07-24 |archive-date=2012-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212220720/http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=166498 & img=141685 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The game was probably of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] origin but spread throughout the Greek world. Many Greek poets mention the game in their works. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and the Age of [[Alexander the Great]], the game had died out. It is not mentioned in [[Latin]] literature.
