 '''Carnitine''' is an [[amino acid]]. It is an [[ammonium]] compound used in the [[metabolism]] of most [[mammals]], plants, and some [[bacteria]]. < ref name= " lpi " > {{Cite web|url=https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/L-carnitine|title=L-Carnitine|date=2019-12-01|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|access-date=2020-04-29}} < /ref > < ref name= " Bremer " > {{cite journal | vauthors = Bremer J | title = Carnitine--metabolism and functions | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_physiological-reviews_1983-10_63_4/page/1420 | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 1420â€“80 | date = October 1983 | pmid = 6361812 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.1983.63.4.1420 }} < /ref > < ref name= " ods " > {{Cite web|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Carnitine-HealthProfessional/|title=Carnitine|publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health|date=2017-10-10|access-date=2020-04-29}} < /ref > < ref name= " drugs " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/npp/l-carnitine.html|title=L-carnitine: Uses, benefits and dosage|publisher=Drugs.com|date=2020-01-20|access-date=2020-04-29}} < /ref >   
 
 When getting energy ([[ATP]]) from [[nutrients]], carnitine transports [[Fatty acid|long-chain fatty acids]] into [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] so that it can be [[Redox|oxidized]] for energy production. Carnitine also also takes part in removing products of metabolism from cells. < ref name=ods/ >  Because of its   important role, carnitine is concentrated in [[tissues]] like [[skeletal muscle]] and [[cardiac muscle]] that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. < ref name=ods/ > 
 
 ==Doping in sport== 
 L-Carnitine is not on the doping list of [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], or [[WADA]], but people in sport got punished in 2019, for the way they used L-Carnitine. < ref > {{cite web|last=Chavez |first=Chris |url=https://www.si.com/olympics/2017/06/09/nike-oregon-project-jeffrey-stuart-brown-doctor |title=Jeffrey Stuart Brown accused of antidoping rules violations |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=9 June 2017 |access-date=21 May 2020}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|author=Rebecca R.
