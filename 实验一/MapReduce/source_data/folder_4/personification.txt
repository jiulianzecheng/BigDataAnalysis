 '''Personification''' is a [[figure of speech]] where non-living [[concept|objects]] are described to seem like [[people]]. 
 
 In the arts, personification means representing a non-human thing as if it were human. Personification gives human [[Trait theory|traits]] and qualities, such as [[emotion]]s, [[wikt:desire|desires]], [[sensation]]s, [[gesture]]s and [[speech]], often by way of a [[metaphor]]. 
 
 Personification is much used in [[visual arts]]. Examples in writing are  " the leaves waved in the wind " ,  " the ocean heaved a sigh "  or  " the Sun smiled at us " . In easy language personification is just giving an example of a living being for a non-living thing.  " The wind shouted " . In these examples, the nonhuman subjects are given human characteristics. 
 
 Another commonly used personification is found in stories where [[animal]]s and [[legendary creature]]s are attributed labels for recognition. This is called [[anthropomorphism]].
