{{nihongo|'''Sansei'''|三世||literally,  " third generation " }} is a [[Japanese language]] term used in countries in [[North America]] and [[South America]] to name the children born to [[Japan]]ese people who [[immigration|immigrated]]. The  [[emigration|emigrants]] or [[immigration|immigrants]] who were born in Japan are called ''[[Issei]]''; and their children born in the new country are called ''Nisei'' (second generation). The [[wikt:grandchild|grandchildren]] of ''Issei'' are called ''Sansei'' (third generation). < ref > The generation names come from the numbers  " one, two, three "  in the [[Japanese language]].  The first three Japanese numbers are  " ''ichi, ni, san''. The fourth number is  " ''yon'' " . < /ref >

 ==History== 
 [[File:Japanese Immigrants disembarkment in Brazil 1937.jpg|thumb|right|The grandchildren of these Japanese-Brazilian (''Nipo-brasileiros'') immigrants would be called ''Sansei''.]] 
 The earliest organized group of Japanese [[Emigration|emigrant]]s settled in [[Mexico]] in 1897. < ref name= " mofa-Mexico " > Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  ''Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations'']; retrieved 2012-11-25. < /ref > 
 
 Imigration to Brazil began in 1908.  Today, the community which grew from the immigrant children and grandchildren has become the largest Japanese emigrant population outside of [[Japan]], including approximately 1.5 million Brazilians. < ref > MOFA, [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/brazil/index.html  " Japan-Brazil Relations " ]; retrieved 2012-11-25. < /ref >  Other communities of ''Sansei'' grew up in the [[United States]], < ref > Sakata, Yasuo.

 The use of the term ''Sansei'' was modeled after an ''Issei'' [[pattern]] or [[template]].  In the 1930s, the term ''Issei'' came into common use.  The word replaced the term  " immigrant "  (''ijusha'').  This change in usage mirrored an evolution in the way the ''Issei'' looked at themselves.  The label ''Issei'' also included the idea of belonging to the new country. < ref name= " mclellan36 " / > 
 
 == Cultural profile == 
 The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was created by sociologists in the late 20th century.  The ''Nikkei'' include all of the world's Japanese immigrants and their descendants. < ref > Japanese American National Museum, [http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/  " What is Nikkei? " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503113652/http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ |date=2009-05-03 }}; retrieved 2012-11-25. < /ref > 
 
 The ''Issei'' were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice. < ref > Smithsonian, [http://americanart.si.edu/pr/library/2010/gaman/gaman_wall_text.pdf   " The Art of Gaman: Arts and Crafts from the Japanese American Internment Camps, 1942 - 1946 " , Yoshitsuchi Ikemoto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225085007/http://americanart.si.edu/pr/library/2010/gaman/gaman_wall_text.pdf |date=2013-02-25 }}; excerpt,  " ... one of hundreds of ''Issei'' (first-generation) 'bachelor' laborers who were unable to send for their wives or a picture bride because the U.S. government cut off all immigration from Japan in 1924 " ; retrieved 2012-11-25. < /ref >   Their ''Sansei'' grandsons and granddaughters grew up with a national and cultural point-of-view that was different from their grandparents. 
 
 Although the ''Issei'' kept an emotional connection with Japan, they created homes in a country far from Japan. < ref > Yenne, Bill. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC & pg=PA12 ''Rising Sons: The Japanese American GIs Who Fought for the United States in World War II,'' p. xv.] < /ref >   The ''Sansei'' had never known a country other than the one into which they were born.
