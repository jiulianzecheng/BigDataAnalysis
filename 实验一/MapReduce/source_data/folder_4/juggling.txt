 '''Juggling''' is a [[skill]] where a person (the ''juggler'') keeps objects (''props'') moving for a long time, using their hands or other parts of their body. The most common props are balls (or beanbags), clubs and rings. Some jugglers use more dangerous objects such as knives, fire torches and [[chainsaw]]s. There are other kinds of juggling prop such as diabolos, [[Yo-yo|yo-yos]], [[Poi spinning|poi]], devil sticks, cigar boxes, foot bags and [[hat]]s. Some jugglers use bouncing objects. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.juggle.org/bounce-juggling-with-rings-and-clubs/|title=Bounce Juggling With Rings And Clubs · IJA|date=13 March 2015|publisher=}} < /ref >   
 
 Juggling can be for [[entertainment]], [[art]] or [[sport]].
