 The '''Adephaga''' is a [[biological classification|suborder]] of [[beetles]]. There are more than 40,000 recorded [[species]] in ten [[family (biology)|families]]. This is the second largest suborder of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Coleoptera]]. 
 
 The beetles of this suborder include [[ground beetle]]s, [[tiger beetle]]s, [[diving beetle]]s, and [[whirligig beetle]]s. Most of the species belong to the family of carabids, or ground beetles ([[Carabidae]]). 
 
 The Adephaga is two groups with a common origin. They are the Hydradephaga (water beetles) and the Geadephaga (ground beetles. They are mostly [[predatory]]. The first fossils of both groups are found in the [[Triassic]] period. < ref name=Grim > Grimaldi D. and Engel M.S. 2005. ''Evolution of the insects''. Cambridge University Press, 267 ''et seq''. {{ISBN|0-521-82149-5}} < /ref >  The ground beetles have formidable chemical defences. They have special [[pygidial gland]]s which squirt out hot, burning chemicals. [[Bombardier beetle]]s are famous for squirting their nasty chemicals at attackers.
