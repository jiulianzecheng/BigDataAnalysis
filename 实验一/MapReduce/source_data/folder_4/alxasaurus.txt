 '''''Alxasaurus''''' (meaning  " Alxa lizard " ) was a [[therizinosaur]] [[theropod]] that lived during the [[Lower Cretaceous]], about 112 to 100 million years ago. Like its near relatives, it was [[herbivorous]]. It was about 13 ft (4 m) long and weighed about 800â€“900 pounds (350 to 400 kg). Five incomplete fossil skeletons have been found in [[Mongolia]].
