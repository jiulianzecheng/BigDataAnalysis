A '''kunya''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:'''كنية''') is a name which is honorably given to an [[Arab]] mother or father. Kunya is pronounced koon-ya. Parents are called by their kunyas, which consists of ''abu'' (father) or ''umm'' (mother) followed by the name of their first son or daughter.  Their whole name is their name plus their kunya.  For example, ''Umm Ja'far Aminah'' means  " the mother of Ja'far, Aminah. "  The kunya precedes the [[personal name]].
