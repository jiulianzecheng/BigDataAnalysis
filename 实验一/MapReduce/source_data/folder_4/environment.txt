 '''Environment''' means what surrounds us. It may be living or non-living things. It includes [[physical]], [[chemical]] and other natural forces. Living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are different interactions between [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[soil]], [[water]], and other living and non-living things. 
 
 The word ''environment'' is used to talk about many things. [[People]] in different fields of knowledge use the word environment differently. Electromagnetic environment is [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[magnetic]] [[field (physics)|fields]]. The environment of a galaxy may mean the [[interstellar medium]], or it may mean other nearby galaxies. 
 
 In [[psychology]] and [[medicine]], a person's environment is the people, physical things and places that the person lives with. The environment affects the growth and development of the person. It may affect the person's behaviour, body and [[mind]].  
 
 The conditions of living organisms in an environment are affected by the weather and climate changes in the environment. They are also greatly affected by other living things.

 {{main|Natural environment}} 
 In biology and ecology, the environment is all of the natural materials and living things, If those things are natural, it is a natural environment. 
 
 Environment includes the living and non-living things that an organism interacts with, or has an effect on it. Living elements that an organism interacts with are known as biotic elements: animals, plants, etc. Abiotic elements are non living things which include air, water, sunlight etc. Studying the environment means studying the relationships among these various things. An example of interactions between non-living and living things is plants getting their minerals from the soil and making food using sunlight. Predation, an organism eating another, is an example of interaction between living things. 
 
 [[Environmentalist]]s think we should protect the natural environment, to keep it safe. Things in the natural environment that we value are called [[natural resource]]s. For example; [[fish]], [[insect]]s, and [[forests]]. These are [[renewable resource]]s because they come back naturally when we use them. [[Non-renewable resource]]s are important things in the environment that are limited for example, [[ore]]s and [[fossil fuels]] after a few thousand years. Some things in the natural environment can kill people, such as [[lightning]]. 
 
 * Ecological units which are natural systems without much human interference. These include all [[vegetation]], [[microorganisms]], [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[atmosphere]], and natural events. 
 * Universal [[natural resource]]s and physical [[phenomenon]] which lack clear-cut boundaries. These include [[climate]], [[air]], [[water]], [[energy]], [[radiation]], [[electric charge]], and [[magnetism]].
