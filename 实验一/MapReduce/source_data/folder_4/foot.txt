{{hatnote|This article is about the body structure. For the unit of measurement see [[Foot (unit)]].}} 
 Land [[Vertebrate|vertebrates]] have '''feet'''. The organization of their feet varies. Two factors come into play: weight and [[lifestyle]].  
 
 1. '''Plantigrade''': heavy animals usually put their heels down to support their weight. 
 
 2. '''Unguligrade''': large animals with [[hooves]].  
 
 3. '''Digitigrade''' is usually reserved for lighter animals. It means to walk on the toes.

 Most heavy animals walk on four legs. < ref > Griffin T.M; Main R.P; Farley C.T. 2004. Biomechanics of quadrupedal walking: how do four-legged animals achieve inverted pendulum-like movements?. ''J Exp Biol''. '''207''' (20): 3545–3558. doi:10.1242/jeb.01177. PMID 15339951 < /ref > < ref > Weissengruber G.E;  &  Forstenpointer G. 2004. Shock absorbers and more: design principles of the lower hind limbs in African elephants (''Loxodonta Africana''). ''J. Morphology'' '''260''': 339. < /ref >  There are some exceptions. Some really heavy birds move or moved on two legs. [[Moa]]s are one example. It is quite clear that an [[ostrich]] is a very effective bird running on two legs.  
 
 Birds generally are an example of the change from four legs (originally as [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]]) to two legs. Humans the end product of changes that started in [[arboreal]] apes.  
 
 The study of such things is called  " comparative foot morphology " .
