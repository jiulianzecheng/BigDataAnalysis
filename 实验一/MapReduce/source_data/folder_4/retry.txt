 Patrick O'Rourke of [[canada.com]] described the game as taking  " one of the few things that was great about [[Flappy Bird]] " . He saw its visuals as paying homage to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] without  " completely ripping them off "  as Flappy Bird had done. He summarised the game as a  " decent pick-up-and-play iOS title " .
