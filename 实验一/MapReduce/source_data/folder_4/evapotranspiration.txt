 '''Evapotranspiration''' is the movement of [[water]] from the Earth's surface to the [[atmosphere]] by [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]].  
 
 Evaporation is the movement of water to the air from the ground or bodies of water (such as [[lake]]s). Transpiration is a process that happens in [[plant]]s, in which water is lost through [[stomata]] in the leaves and becomes [[vapour]] in the air. Together, these form an important process in the [[water cycle]].
