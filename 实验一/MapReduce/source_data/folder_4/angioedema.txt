 '''Angioedema''' is swelling that is similar to [[hives]], but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface. 
 
 Hives are often called welts. They are a surface swelling. It is possible to have angioedema without hives. 
 
 ==Causes== 
 
 Angioedema may be caused by an [[allergy|allergic reaction]]. During the reaction, [[histamine]] and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an allergen. 
 
 In most cases, the cause of angioedema is never found. 
 
 The following may cause angioedema: 
 * Animal dander (scales of shed skin) 
 * Exposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat 
 * Foods (such as berries, shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, and milk) 
 * Insect bites 
 * Medicines (drug allergy) such as [[antibiotics]] (penicillin and sulfa drugs), [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), and blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors) 
 * [[Pollen]] 
 Hives and angioedema may also occur after infections or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as [[lupus]], [[leukemia]], and [[lymphoma]]). 
 
 A form of angioedema happens in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema.
