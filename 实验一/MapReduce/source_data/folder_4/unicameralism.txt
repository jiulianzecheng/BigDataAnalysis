 In [[government]], '''unicameralism''' is when there is only one [[legislative]] or [[parliament|parliamentary]] [[Chambers of parliament|chamber]]. Therefore, a unicameral legislature or unicameral parliament is a legislature with one chamber. It comes from the [[Latin]]  " uni "  (meaning one) and  " camera "  (meaning chamber). 
 
 Unicameral legislatures are used around the world. 
 
 Since 1937, the [[United States|US]] State of [[Nebraska]]â€™s [[Nebraska Legislature]] has been unicameral, however all other US states use a [[bicameral]] system.
