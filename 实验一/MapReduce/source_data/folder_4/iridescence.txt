 '''Iridescence''' is a thing about some surfaces. If a surface looks like its colour changes as the light moves, then it is iridescent. 
 
 There are many iridescent things in nature. [[Soap bubble]]s, [[butterfly]] wings and [[sea shell]]s, and some [[minerals]] are iridescent. They have tiny structures that affect the light. 
 
 The physical process which causes iridescence is usually [[interference]].
