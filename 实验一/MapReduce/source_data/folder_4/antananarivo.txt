 '''Antananarivo''' is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Madagascar]]. It is the largest [[city]] in the [[country]]. The city is the [[administration|administrative]], [[communication]]s and [[economy|economic]] center of Madagascar. 
 
 Antananarivo has a [[population]] of over 1.4 million people. Including an [[Anglican church|Anglican]] [[church|cathedral]] and a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[church|cathedral]], there are about fifty [[church]]es in the city and its [[suburb]]s. There is also a [[Islam|Muslim]] [[mosque]]. Antananarivo is home of the [[University of Madagascar]] and the [[Collège Rural d'Ambatobe]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Antananarivo was [[:wikt:found|founded]] in about 1625 by [[King]] [[Andrianjaka]]. The name, Antananarivo, means ''the City of the Thousand''. It comes from the number of [[soldier]]s Andrianjaka used to guard the city. 
 
 Until 1869 all [[building]]s in the city were of [[wood]] or [[rush]]es. Since the introduction of [[stone]] and [[brick]], the whole city has been rebuilt. It now has many notable structures. For example, the [[Royal family|royal]] [[palace]]s, the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, several stone and brick churches, [[college]]s, [[school]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[court]]s of [[judiciary|justice]] and other [[government]] buildings. 
 
 The city was captured by the [[France|French]] in 1895. Since then, good roads have been built in the city.
