 '''Farming''' is growing [[crop]]s and keeping animals for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming is a [[wikt:major|major]] part of [[agriculture]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Farming started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is. < ref > Colin Tudge argues  " from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers' " . Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld  &  Nicolson, p3. {{ISBN|0-297-84258-7}} < /ref >  The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] as people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and became [[settler]]s in cities. 
 
 Farming and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, the [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]). < ref > Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. University College London Press. {{ISBN|1-56098-675-1}} < /ref >  The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew.  
 
 Cotton was [[domestication|domesticated]] in Peru by 4200 BC < !--; another species of cotton was domesticated in Mesoamerica and became by far the most important species of cotton in the textile industry in modern times-- > . < ref > [https://www.yara.us/crop-nutrition/cotton/world-cotton-production/#:~:text=90%25%20of%20today's%20commercial%20cotton,most%20of%20their%20production%20domestically. World Cotton Production, Yara North America] < /ref > 
 
 Livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats were taken to the [[Americas]], from the [[Old World]]. The first of those horses, came with the Spanish [[conquistador]]s < ref > https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/blog/american-horses-horses-in-north-america-a-comeback-story/#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201400s%2C%20Spanish,and%20spread%20across%20the%20nation.. [[PBS]].org. Retrieved 2023-07-31 < /ref >  (or soldiers and [[explorer]]s) in the 1490s. Moving those cattle, sheep, goats and horses, were part of the [[Columbian Exchange]]. 
 
 People probably started agriculture by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.

 == Types == 
 *Arable farming means growing [[crops]]. This would include [[wheat]] or vegetables. 
 *Growing [[fruit]] means having [[orchard]]s devoted to fruit. They cannot be switched easily with growing field crops. Therefore, they are not classed as arable land in the statistics. 
 
 Many people still live by [[subsistence farming]], on a small farm. They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s. Where yields are low, [[deforestation]] can provide new land to grow more food. This provides more [[nutrition]] for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding [[environment]] over many years. 
 
 In some countries, farms are often fewer and larger. During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. 
 
 This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt builddup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education. 
 
 Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value. They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and [[drought]], and are easier to harvest. Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have changed crop plants. The crops produce better yield. [[Fertilizers]], chemical [[pest control]], and [[irrigation]] all help. 
 
 Some plants are improved with [[genetic engineering]]. One example is modifying the plant to resist herbicides. 
 
 === Livestock === 
 Farms may also keep animals. That is called [[animal husbandry]]. If they are used to make meat for people to eat, that is [[livestock]] production. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, are kept for their produce.  " Produce "  here means their eggs and milk, which are sold by the farm, usually in [[market]]s. Large animals need grassland of some kind for grazing. What they need depends on the animals. [[Domestic goat|Goats]] eat a much wider range of plants than cows. In some parts of the world, that makes goats a more sensible choice for a farmer than cows. 
 
 == Food == 
 [[File:Sinai palm dates farming.jpg|thumb|Sinai palm dates farming]] 
 It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture. 
 * Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries. 
 * Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. 
 * Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. 
 * Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process. 
 
 Agricultural [[Policy debate|policy]] means the goals and methods of agricultural production. Common goals of policy include the quality, amount, and safety of food. 
 
 == Problems == 
 There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today. 
 These include: 
 * [[Pollution]] 
 * [[Erosion]] 
 * [[Diseases]] 
 * [[Pests]] 
 * [[Weed]]s 
 * [[Drought]] 
 * [[Rainfall]] 
 * [[Climate]]: Earth warming is an important example 
 * [[Contamination]] 
 
 There are also difficulties with the distribution of food: 
 * [[Warfare]]: see [[Nigerian Civil War]] (Biafran War) for an example. See [[Russo-Ukrainian War|Russia–Ukrainian war]] for an example. 
 * [[Distribution]]: Difficulties with moving product from grower to consumer. It is expected that this difficulty will increase in future. The reasons for this are complex, but one important factor may be the absence of a dominant international naval power. The [[British Navy]] provided protection against [[Piracy|pirates]] in the 19th and early 20th century, and the [[US Navy]] protected shipping after [[WWII]]. The US is still a dominant naval power, but its power will soon be based on its small number of huge aircraft carriers. They will not deal with small boats full of armed pirates, which is the usual way [[piracy]] is done. So we can expect grain ships (etc) will have to carry any protection they may need, or they will have to go the long way around. That means avoiding the shortcuts into the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Other kinds of warfare, such as we see in the [[Ukraine]], adds to the problem of shipping food products safely. 
 
 == Crops == 
 In produced weight, these crops are the most important (global production in metric tonnes): < ref > FAO 2015. FAO Statistical Pocketbook 2015, {{ISBN|978-92-5-108802-9}}, p. 28 < /ref > 
 
 The figure for sugarcane is rather deceptive. It omits [[sugar beet]], but includes the weight of the woody stalk. Most of the plants which produce food are in the grass family [[Poaceae]].
