 == History == 
 During the 17th century, the valley was ruled by a famous tribal leader of the Swatis. His title was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of Agror. His real name was Akund Saad-ud-din. < ref > ''Hazara District Gazetteer 1883-84'', Lahore 1884 < /ref >  He was a ''[[mullah]]'' or petty [[Muslim]] religious scholar, who obtained power over the local people of the Agror valley. In time, he established himself as the local 'Khan' or chieftain and controlled the whole valley. His capital was at [[Oghi]] town. 
 
 In 1888, during the period of the [[British Empire]], the Khan's descendant, Ali Gohar, was removed from power. The title and estate were formally abolished. < ref > ''Hazara Gazetteer 1907'' < /ref >  However, the Akund's descendants still use this courtesy title.
