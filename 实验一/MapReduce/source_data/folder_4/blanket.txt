 A '''blanket''' is a large, usually rectangular piece of [[cloth]], generally used on a [[bed]] over a sheet to keep the [[sleep]]ing person [[warm]]. Some blankets are [[knitting|knitted]] or [[crochet]]ed while others are made of two [[layer]]s of cloth sewn together with stuffing in the middle. Blankets can be made with hollow fibre or feathers. 
 
 Other names for blankets are quilts, duvets, and comforters, depending on their thickness, construction and/or stuffing. 
 
 The word blanket probably came from the 14th century. A special kind of fabric called Blanket fabric was created by a Flemish weaver who lived in [[Bristol]], [[England]].

 Blankets may also be used on the ground for a [[picnic]] or other places where people want to sit without their clothing getting dirty or wet. 
 
 Firefighters use a special [[fire blanket]] to protect household items such as chairs from water damage. 
 
 ==Types of blankets== 
 Electric blankets are heated by [[electricity]]. Blankets were traditionally made of [[wool]] because it is warm, naturally fire-retardant, and allows air to circulate well, while today synthetic fibers are frequently used. Throw blankets are smaller blankets, often in decorative colors and patterns, that can be used for extra warmth outside of bed. 
 
 Other kinds are horse blankets, used to keep [[horses]] warm, and saddle blankets, used to prevent the horse's [[saddle]] from rubbing on its skin. 
 
 Blanket terminology is also used in the printing industry. A blanket is a rubber coating over different layer of compressible material. It wraps around a cylinder and insures transfer of ink form the printed material (where the image is ink defined) to the paper. Blankets are used for offset, gravure, flexo, etc.
