 The '''turbot''' (''Scophthalmus maximus'') is a relatively large [[flatfish]] found in the [[North Atlantic|Atlantic]], [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. 
 
 Turbot are fished for food, and have a delicate [[flavour]]. They are farmed in a number of countries, and are quite expensive in [[restaurants]]. 
 
 When caught, [[professional]] [[Fishing|fishermen]] often make small cuts through the [[bone]] near the [[tail]]fin. This lets the blood out and keeps the meat white. Storing the Turbot upside down also helps in keeping the underside of the fish white.
