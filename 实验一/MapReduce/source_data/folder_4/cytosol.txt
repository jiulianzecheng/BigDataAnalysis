The '''cytosol''' (also known as '''intracellular fluid''' (ICF) or '''cytoplasmic matrix''', or '''groundplasm''') is the internal [[fluid]] of the [[cell (biology)|cell]], and a part of cell [[metabolism]] occurs here. 
 
 [[Protein]]s within the '''cytosol''' play an important role in [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[glycolysis]]. 
 
 Cytosol mostly consists of water, [[:wikt:dissolve|dissolved]] [[ion]]s, small [[molecule]]s, and large water-soluble molecules (such as protein). It contains about 20% to 30% [[protein]]. 
 
 Normal human cytosolic [[pH]] is (roughly) 7.0 (i.e. neutral), whereas the [[pH]] of the extracellular fluid is 7.4. 
 
 The texture of cytosol being described as [[granular]] can be attributed to the fact that in order to study the texture, an [[electron microsope]] must be used, which requires a process of dehydration prior to study.
