 '''Steak''' is a slice off a larger piece of [[meat]], usually [[beef]]. In [[North America]], steaks are usually [[grill (cooking)|grilled]]. They are also often [[Pan frying|pan fried]] or [[Baking|baked]]. The most tender (softest) cuts of the animal are usually used for steak. This also means that steaks have a high price. The pieces of meat used for steaks are usually cut across the muscle fiber, not along it. This makes them look more tender. 
 
 A [[restaurant]] that mainly makes steaks is known as a [[steakhouse]]. A well-known side dish to steak is [[prawn]]s or a cooked [[lobster]] tail. This combination is often called ''surf and turf'' or ''reef and beef'' (the words  " surf "  and  " reef "  refer to the seafood and  " turf "  and  " beef "  refer to the steak). Special steak [[knives]] are used to cut steak. A steak knife is sharper than most table knives and is usually serrated. 
 
 Fish is not the only side dish for steak. Other common side dishes are baked [[potato]]es, [[Bread roll|dinner rolls]], [[salad]], and [[Maize|corn]] on the cob. In [[France]], steaks are often served with [[french fries]]. This combination is known as ''steak fries'' or ''steak-frites''. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Steak frites {{!}} food|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/steak-frites|access-date=2021-05-07|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref >  They do not come with vegetables, but sometimes a [[salad]] is served with them. 
 
 == Seasoning == 
 Steaks are seasoned with [[salt]] and [[black pepper]]. Some additional seasonings are [[garlic]], [[rosemary]], and other [[Herb|herbs]] and [[Spice|spices]]. [[Marinade|Marinades]] are also an option depending on the cut. [[Butter]] can also be used for [[Basting (cooking)|basting]] steaks for a milky flavor. Often, steaks are served with a special sauce called  " [[steak sauce]] " , but sometimes steaks are served with a spicy sauce called [[Horseradish (sauce)|horseradish]].

 == Degrees of cooking == 
 Meat that is cooked less will appear to be more tender and soft. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Degree of Doneness,to well, medium, and rare steak cooking temperatures|url=https://www.certifiedangusbeef.com/kitchen/doneness.php|access-date=2021-05-26|website=www.certifiedangusbeef.com|language=en}} < /ref >  The usual degrees of cooking for steaks (and some other meats) are:
