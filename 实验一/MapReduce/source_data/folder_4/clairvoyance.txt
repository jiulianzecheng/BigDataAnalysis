 '''Clairvoyance''' is an ability to know about things or events that will occur in the future.

This, they say, is why some people think they have clairvoyance. < ref name=WP > {{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/you-think-youre-clairvoyant-but-your-brain-is-just-tricking-you/2018/01/12/005b8d48-deac-11e7-bbd0-9dfb2e37492a_story.html|accessdate=June 22, 2021|title=You think you're clairvoyant, but your brain is just tricking you|date=January 13, 2018|newspaper=The Washington Post|author1=Adam Bear|author2= Rebecca Fortgang|author3=Michael Bronstein}} < /ref > < ref name=Bear > {{cite journal|title=A Simple Task Uncovers a Postdictive Illusion of Choice |author1=Adam Bear|author2=Paul Bloom|accessdate=June 22, 2021|date=April 28, 2016|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616641943|doi=10.1177/0956797616641943|journal=Psychological Science|volume=27|issue=6|pages=914–922|pmid=27125962|s2cid=16028974}} < /ref > < ref name=Mist > {{cite journal|title=Mistiming of thought and perception predicts delusionality|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|author1=Adam Bear|author2= Rebecca G.
