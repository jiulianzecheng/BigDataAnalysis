 '''Radiohead''' are an [[England|English]] [[rock music|rock]] [[band]] from [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]]. The [[lead singer]] and songwriter of the band is [[Thom Yorke]], who also plays guitar and piano. Thom is known for his [[falsetto|high voiced]] singing style. The band is known for their different style of rock music. 
 
 The band has five members, and three of them play guitar. In their early years, Radiohead was known for their layered and heavy guitar sound. In later years, the band began using other instruments too, and creating more [[Electronic music|electronic]] sounds. The band still performs live and attracts large crowds of fans to sold-out concerts, even though they play many different styles of music. 
 
 They have created nine albums so far, the most recent being [[A Moon Shaped Pool|''A Moon Shaped Pool'']] (2016). 
 
 == History == 
 Radiohead started in 1985. The members of the band went to school together at Abingdon School, a boys' school in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]]. < ref name=smh > Craig McLean (14 June 2003).

 On A Friday signed a [[contract]] with [[EMI]], a large [[record label]], in 1991. They changed their name to  " Radiohead " . This name came from the song  " Radio Head "  on the [[album]] ''True Stories'' by [[Talking Heads]]. < ref > Michael Hastings. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/r19641 True Stories  >  Overview].

''[[NME]]''. Accessed  28 November 2008. < /ref >  At the time, Radiohead's [[style]] of music was not very popular, and people said it sounded like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], but was not as good.

Accessed 28 November 2008. < /ref >   " Creep "  was played on the [[radio]] at a lot of [[college]]s around the world, however. When Radiohead went on [[music tour|tour]] in the United States in early 1993, the [[music video]] for  " Creep "  was being played frequently on [[MTV]]. < ref > " Creepshow " .

 Radiohead made an [[Extended play|EP]] in 1994. This was called ''My Iron Lung'', and contained the title single, and seven songs known as B-sides (because they were not on a full-length album). The main song,  " My Iron Lung " , was about the way fans had reacted to their song  " Creep " . The band was happy the song had been a hit, because otherwise they might not have been able to continue the band. But the band, especially Thom Yorke, were reluctant to be celebrities. They were already disturbed by the workings of the music industry. They felt they had no control over things.  " Creep "  was popular, so they felt under pressure to make more similar songs. They hated the way  " Creep "  was the only Radiohead song anyone listened to at their concerts, yet it was all that was keeping them popular and afloat in the record industry. The  " iron lung "  was a metaphor for such a  " life support " . 
 
 Their second normal album, ''The Bends'', came out in 1995. The album was going to released in late 1994 but was also delayed. The song  " My Iron Lung "  was on it, along with 11 new ones. The band released four more songs as singles:  " Fake Plastic Trees " ,  " High and Dry " ,  " Just "  and  " Street Spirit [Fade Out] " . None of these songs were as popular as  " Creep "  around the world. Radiohead was now a one-hit wonder to many people in America. Songs from ''The Bends'' did not get played on the radio very much there. But the album became very popular in Radiohead's home of the UK. It also got excellent reviews from music critics, unlike the band's first album. Many said it was one of the best rock records in memory. The album was produced by John Leckie, a veteran at EMI's Abbey Road studios. As a young man Leckie had assisted on Pink Floyd albums in the 1970s. 
 
 The band's lineup was the same for ''The Bends''. Thom Yorke and Ed O'Brien played rhythm and auxiliary guitar; Thom sang and Ed sang backup. Phil Selway played drums and percussion. Colin Greenwood played bass guitar. Radiohead's lead guitarist was Jonny Greenwood, Colin's younger brother. Jonny was also younger than any of the other members. Jonny was the only member of the band who did not graduate from university. He was also the only member who had attended music school. Jonny had had to leave university after a few months to join Radiohead on a tour when they became popular. But he played in an orchestra when he was young, and he had a knowledge of classical and experimental music and jazz. Thus, Jonny became the band's musical expert. At this stage he already played many instruments, such as keyboard. 
 
 It was Jonny's complex and cathartic guitar solos in songs like  " Just "  and  " The Bends "  that soon began to attract notice. So did his simpler playing in other songs. The circle of Radiohead fans began to grow. Thom Yorke's lyrics also began talking about larger more political themes during this time. Mostly, they were still about personal disappointments, loves, losses, depression, unease, and anger. But Thom wrote songs like  " Fake Plastic Trees "  and  " Street Spirit "  which found the source of the unease in the larger structure of society, not the individual. 
 
 Radiohead's style of music had gotten more mature, according to most people, without changing too much. Some others felt their songwriting had improved so much it was no longer unrecognizable. The band used more keyboards and acoustic guitar this time, and made a more subtle atmosphere. But electric guitars were the main instrument used on the record. Some of Radiohead's influences this time were: the post-punk band Magazine, the singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, Morrissey's (former Smiths singer) ''Vauxhall  &  I'', and the music of R.E.M. That band had inspired Radiohead from the beginning. Radiohead would get a chance to tour with them in summer 1995, after releasing the album. Lead singer Michael Stipe became a friend and mentor to Thom, and also a public fan of Radiohead. In 1995 he said  " they're so good, they're scary " . 
 
 The band's influences had expanded once more by the time of their next album ''OK Computer''. 
 
 With ''OK Computer'' (released in 1997), the band started the next section of their career. They started using more sounds from [[electronic music]]. They released the album ''Kid A'' (released in 2000, was initially going to release sometime in late 1999) which had a lot less use of guitar than on previous albums, but was still called one of their best albums (with some people calling it their best). An album of songs recorded during this time, but that did not appear on ''Kid A'' was released, called ''Amnesiac'' (released in 2001). In 2003 they released the album ''Hail To The Thief'' which was a return to a sound with more guitars and less use of electronic sounds. In 2007 they released ''In Rainbows''. It was first released for free on the band's website, then released properly on January 1, 2008. The album was delayed two times. It was going to be released in late 2005, then it was going to be released sometime in 2006, before finally being released in 2007. 
 
 After this, they went on to release ''The King of Limbs'' (2011) and ''A Moon Shaped Pool'' (2016), which both garnered critical and popular acclaim. Additionally, they released TKOL RMX 1234567 (2011), an album of collaborations with the likes of Four Tet, Jamie XX, and Caribou and an remix of OK Computer named ''OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017'' (2017). Their most recent album is ''KID A MNESIA'' (2021), an extended and reworked version of Kid A which is over 2 hours long.
