 * Thinking about [[money]] 
 * Thinking about how to control money to make profit

 ==Some simple finance ideas== 
 The process of '''finance''' is learning, how people and groups act in managing their money, and most of all how they manage making money, and making a profit, with spending money, or making a loss. 
 
 A group that makes more money than it spends can lend or invest the excess profit. On the other hand, a group that makes less money than it spends can raise money by getting a loan or selling part of its assets or spending less, or making more money.  
 
 A [[bank]] is where many people borrowing money meet people lending money. A bank gets money from lenders, and pays [[interest]]. The bank then lends this money to borrowers. Banks allow borrowers and lenders of different sizes to meet.  
 
 Corporate finance is  about things like the sale of stock by a company to the public. Stock is ownership in a company, broken up into pieces. The stock gives whoever owns it part ownership in that company.  If someone buys one share of XYZ Inc, and the company has 100 shares available, the buyer is 1/100th owner of that company and owns 1/100th (1%) of the profit.  
 
 Finance is used by people, by governments, by businesses, etc., as well as by all kinds of groups. 
 
 ==Personal finance==

 *How much money will be needed by a person, now and when they get old. 
 *Where will this money come from (e.g. savings or borrowing)?   
 *How can people protect themselves against problems with money in their lives? 
 *How can family money be given to children and grandchildren? 
 *How do taxes affect money choices?
