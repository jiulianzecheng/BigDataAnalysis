 A '''necktie''' (or a '''tie''') is an article of [[clothing]] worn by [[men]]. A tie is part of an ensemble (or outfit) of clothing called the  " [[suit and tie]]. "  This outfit is worn in Western countries by men in professional jobs such as [[business]], [[law]], and [[politics]]. 
 
 A necktie is usually made of [[silk]] or [[polyester]], and it usually has a color or [[pattern]] on it. Men tie a knot in neckties and wear them with [[dress shirt]]s in order to make them look more formal.

 == Bow ties == 
 The '''bow tie''' is a type of necktie. It is a [[ribbon]] of [[Textile|fabric]] tied around the [[collar]] in a [[symmetry|symmetrical]] manner such that the two opposite ends form loops.  
 
 Ready-tied bow ties are available, in which the distinctive bow is sewn and a band goes around the neck and clips to secure. Some  " clip-ons "  dispense with the band altogether, instead clipping to the collar.
