 The town was started in the 1860s on the site of the farm. This was where the track for people going to the [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] [[gold]] fields crossed the [[Mandagery Creek]]. A bridge was built over the creek, and then the John Bull [[Hotel]] (later the Fat Lamb Hotel) was built next to it. In 1881, the town was laid out and a [[police station]], [[courthouse]] and [[school]] were built. < ref name= " Walkabout " / >  The creek has flooded many times; in 2005 it had a flood peak of {{convert|9|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}.

 Australia's biggest gold robbery took place near Eugowra.  The [[bushranger]]s, [[Frank Gardiner]], [[Ben Hall]] and their gang robbed the [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]] to [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] Ford and Company [[stagecoach|coach]] on 15 June, 1862.  The bushrangers stole {{convert|77|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} of gold and £3,700 in cash. < ref name= " Walkabout " / > < ref name= " Travelmate " > {{cite web

Coaches and wagons had to slow down to get around a steep gully which went down to Mandagery Creek. They also had to get past many large [[granite]] rocks. One of these rocks was called  " Coonbong "  (dead man) by the Wiradjuri people. < ref name=eugowra > {{cite web|url= http://www.eugowra.aus.net/robbery.htm|title= Gold Escort Robbery at Eugowra Rocks|accessdate= 2008-10-26|format= |work= Welcome to Eugowra Bushranger Country|archive-date= 2008-11-18|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081118200552/http://www.eugowra.aus.net/robbery.htm|url-status= dead}} < /ref >  Gardiner’s gang stopped two [[bullock]] wagons and left them in the middle of the road. When the gold escort coach arrived it had to slow right down and try to get past the wagons. The bushrangers, hidden behind the rocks, fired their guns at the coach. The coach driver and two policemen were wounded. One policeman had been shot in the [[testicles]]. The horses reared up and the coach was tipped on its side. One policemen assisted the wounded and they escaped into the bush. They went towards the Eugowra homestead for help. The other policeman went back down the road to a small hotel, Lyell's Shanty. < ref name=eugowra/ > 
 
 The bushrangers took the gold and money. They put it onto the back of one of the coach horses. They went back to their horses which had been hidden up the hill. They escaped into the bush and stopped at the southern end of Noble’s Lagoon to share out the bags of gold. They went to Mount Wheogo, north of the Weddin Mountains, where Gardiner had his camp. < ref name=eugowra/ > 
 
 A local farmer, Hanbury Clements, heard the gun shots and went to find out what was going on. He found the wounded men and helped them back to the farm house. He got on to his horse and rode the {{convert|27|mi|km|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} to Forbes in the dark in less than three hours to report the robbery. The police arrived quickly, and with the help of an aboriginal tracker, Jimmy Dargan, they were soon following the bushrangers. Gardiner’s camp at Wheogo had a good view of the country. John  " the Warrigal Walsh " , (the brother of Ben Hall's wife), warned the bushrangers that the police were coming and the gang got away. < ref name=eugowra/ > 
 
 Most of the gold was still loaded on the back of the very tired coach horse. The bushrangers finally had to leave the horse in the foothills of the Weddin Mountains. They only took the money with them. The police got most of the gold back. Only Ben Hall and Frank Gardiner's share of the gold was not found. < ref name=eugowra/ >
