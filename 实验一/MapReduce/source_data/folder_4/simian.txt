 The '''simians''' (infraorder '''Simiiformes''') are the  " higher primates " . Familiar to most people are the [[Old World monkey]]s and [[ape]]s, including [[human]]s and the [[New World monkey]]s. Simians tend to be larger than the  " lower primates "  or [[prosimian]]s.  
 
 The simians are sister to the [[tarsier]]s: together they make up the [[haplorhine]]s. The radiation occurred about 60 million years ago during the [[Cenozoic]] era.  
 
 40 million years ago, simians from Afro-Arabia colonized South America (by what route is not known). This gave rise to the [[New World monkeys]]. The remaining simians ([[catarrhine]]s) split 25 million years ago into Old World monkeys and apes.
