 A '''spire''' is a tapering [[cone|conical]] or [[pyramid]]al structure on the top of a building, particularly a [[church]] [[tower]]. [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the word comes from the [[Old English]] word ''spir'', meaning a sprout, shoot, or stalk of [[grass]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=spire & searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}} < /ref > 
 
 Symbolically, spires have two effects. One is to show strength and power. A spire, with its spear point, gives the impression of strength. The other is to reach up toward the skies as a religious [[gesture]]. < ref > Robert Odell Bork 2003. ''Great spires: skyscrapers of the New Jerusalem'', 2003. < /ref >  This is one reason for its association with religious buildings, and a similar reason has been given for the large pyramids in Egypt and early American civilisations. However, the tallest spires today are [[secular]] places of business or hotels, such as [[The Shard]]. 
 
 As an [[architecture|architectural]] ornament, spires are most often found on [[Christian]] churches.
