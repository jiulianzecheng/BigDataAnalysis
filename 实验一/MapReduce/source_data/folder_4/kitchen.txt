 The '''kitchen''' is the [[room]] in the [[house]] where [[food]] is [[cook]]ed. Sometimes, people eat in their kitchens, too. [[Hotel]]s, [[school]]s, and places where people work often have kitchens as well. A person who works in a kitchen in one of these places may be a kitchen worker or a [[chef]] (depending on where he/she cooks). An outdoor kitchen at a campsite might be placed near a well, water pump, or water tap, and it might provide tables for food preparation. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Outdoor Kitchen Ideas|url=https://www.outdoor-kitchen-ideas.co.uk/|access-date=2020-10-04|website=www.outdoor-kitchen-ideas.co.uk}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Why you should consider a kitchen renovation {{!}} Proficiency|url=https://www.proficiencyltd.co.uk/kitchen-renovations.html|access-date=2021-05-29|website=www.proficiencyltd.co.uk}} < /ref >
