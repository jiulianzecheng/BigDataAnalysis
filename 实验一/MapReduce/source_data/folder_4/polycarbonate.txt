'''Polycarbonate''' is a [[wikt:transparent|transparent]] (something which can be seen through) [[thermoplastic]]. This material is tough and stable. It can resist a high temperature of 138째C (280째[[temperature|F)]] and a low temperature of -40째C (-40째F). It is [[stain]] resistant and non-toxic. The weight of polycarbonate is one sixth of [[glass]].  
 
 Industries use polycarbonate for making different products, from bulletproof windows to [[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s. The main advantages of polycarbonate are high strength and light weight. 
 
 Industries use clear polycarbonate to make [[glasses]]. This is because it has very good [[transparency]] and durability. Lenses made from clear polycarbonate can be thinner than lenses made from regular glass. 
 
 Companies that make electronic equipment use polycarbonate to make the cover of mobile [[mobile phone|phones]], [[laptop]]s and other products. Although polycarbonate is not poisonous, the process of making polycarbonate uses toxic chemicals. (See [[Bisphenol A]]).
