 A '''smile''' is a [[face]] made by flexing the [[muscle]]s near both ends of the [[mouth]]. < ref > Freitas-Magalhães A.  &  Castro E. 2009.

Freitas-Magalhães (ed) Emotional expression: the brain and the face. 1-18 Porto: University Fernando Pessoa Press. {{ISBN|978-989-643-034-4}} < /ref >  The smile can also be made through the [[eyes]] (See 'Duchenne smile' below).

 == Duchenne smile == 
 
 Although there are many different types of smiles, researchers are interested in the duchenne smile because it is done with the eyes. The Duchenne smile was named after the French physician [[Duchenne de Boulogne|Guillaume Duchenne]]. Duchenne identified two types of smiles. A '''Duchenne smile''' is when the cheek raises and forms a wrinkle around the eyes. < ref > Duchenne, Guillaume 1990. ''The mechanism of human facial expression''. New York: Cambridge University Press. (Original published 1862) < /ref >  Many researchers think that Duchenne smiles are usually hard to make when you are pretending to smile. < ref > Ekman P., Friesen W.V. and O'Sullivan M. 1988. Smiles when lying. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology''. '''54''' 414–420 < /ref > 
 
 ==Internet== 
 
 On the [[Internet]], smiles can normally be typed up. This is normally called a [[smiley]], smiley face, or happy face. Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life. Smileys typed on the [[computer]] are called [[emoticon]]s. Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is.
