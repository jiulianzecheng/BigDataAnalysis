 '''''Parasaurolophus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of what is now [[North America]], about 76.5–73 & nbsp;million years ago. < ref name=evansetal2009 > Evans, D.C., Bavington R. and Campione N.E. 2009.

It was given this name because when it was first discovered scientists thought it was related to [[Saurolophus]]. It was a [[herbivore]] that walked both as [[biped]] and a [[quadruped]]. It probably lived in [[herd]]s.  
 
 Parasaurolophus was a [[hadrosaur]]. They had a large head crest, which was a long curved tube. It went upwards and back from the skull. The crest has been much discussed by scientists. They think its main functions were visual recognition of species and sex, acoustic resonance (making a loud sound), and [[thermoregulation]]. Parasaurolophus is one of the rarer hadrosaurs: there are only a few good specimens.
