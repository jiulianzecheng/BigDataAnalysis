 '''Ink''' is a [[liquid]] that is used to [[write]], [[draw]], print, or make marks. The word ink is from [[Latin language|Latin]] and means  " colored water " . Ink is used in [[pen]]s, in some computer printers, and in [[printing press]]es. In some countries, people write by using ink and [[brush]]es. People usually write or print using black ink, but ink can be any [[color]]. The first ink was used in [[Egypt]] about 2600 BC. 
 
 The first inks were carbon inks, made from soot, which is 80% [[carbon]], water and [[gum arabic]]. Red ink would need [[iron oxide]] (such as [[haematite]]) from ground rocks instead of soot. Later, in Europe, people used iron [[gall]] ink. This is the kind of ink [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] used. Now ink colours are produced by man-made [[dye]]s. 
 
 A disadvantage of many kinds of ink is that they may smudge when wet, spoiling the picture or writing. If water-based ink is used, the writing situation needs to be stable, with the writer seated at a table. Ink in a [[ballpoint pen]] (biro) is a kind of [[gel]]. It is held in a thin long [[cylinder]] (tube) inside the pen. The ink does not fall out of the cylinder as it sticks to the sides of the tube. Therefore, ballpoint pens can be used in a wider range of circumstances compared to water-based inks.
