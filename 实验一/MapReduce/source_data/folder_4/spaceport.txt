 A '''spaceport''' is a place for [[spacecraft]] to launch or land. It may have [[launch pad]]s for [[rocket]], and many buildings for preparing and launching space flights. In real life, there are very few spaceports across the world. They are mostly owned by government agencies, for example [[NASA]]. They are used to launch scientific research missions, launch [[Satellite (artificial)|man-made satellites]] and animals. 
 
 However, [[science fiction]] stories set in the future often have spaceports that are more like modern [[airport]]s. In these stories, many spacecraft may come and go each day, and they may transport passengers like a real-life [[airline]].
