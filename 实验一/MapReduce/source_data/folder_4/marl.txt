 '''Marl''' is an earthy material rich in [[carbonate minerals]], [[Clay minerals|clays]], and [[silt]]. When [[Lithification|hardened into rock]], it becomes '''marlstone'''. It is created in marine or [[freshwater]] environments. Usually it is found through the activities of [[algae]]. 
 
 Marl makes up the lower part of the [[White Cliffs of Dover|cliffs of Dover]]. The [[Channel Tunnel]] follows these marl layers between [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Marl is also a common [[sediment]] in post-[[glacial lakes]]. An example of this would be the marl ponds of the [[northeastern United States]].
