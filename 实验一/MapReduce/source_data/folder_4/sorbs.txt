{{distinguish|Serbs}} 
 The '''Sorbs''' are Slavic people. They live mostly in [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]. There are 60,000 Sorbian people in the world. About 25,000 people speak one of the [[Sorbian language]]s.   
 
 In Germany and Poland Sorbs do not use the old fashioned words  " Wends "  or  " Wendish "  to describe themselves. American and Australian communities often prefer to call themselves  " Wends "  or  " Wendish " . They think that “Sorb” and “Sorbian” are bad words.   
 
 Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian [[dialect]]s are protected languages in parts of Germany under the [[European Charter for Minority or Regional Languages]]
