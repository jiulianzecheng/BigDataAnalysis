It has been a [[national]] [[monument]] since 2010. < ref > http://erfgoedstem.nl/zocherpark-euromast-nu-monument/ Euromast is now a monument < /ref >  To make the tower more [[Stability|stable]], it was build on a block of [[concrete]] of {{convert|1900000|kg|abbr=on}}. It has an [[Observation deck|observation platform]] {{convert|96|m|abbr=on}} high, and a [[restaurant]]. Originally, at {{convert|101|m|abbr=on}} tall, it was the tallest building in Rotterdam.
