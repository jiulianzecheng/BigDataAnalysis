 The '''Horae''' were three [[goddess]]es in [[Greek mythology]].

 They were the children of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]].

 The first Horae were goddesses of the [[season]]s. 
 They were: 
 *'''Thallo''' (or Thalatte) 
 *'''Auxo''' (or Auxesia) 
 *'''Karpo''' (also Xarpo or Carpo) 
 
 ==Second Generation== 
 The second Horae were goddesses of [[order]], [[:wikt:justice|justice]] and [[law]]. 
 They were: 
 *'''Dike''' 
 *'''Eunomia''' 
 *'''Eirene''' (or Irene)
