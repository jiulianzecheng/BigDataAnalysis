 '''Lodging''' or '''holiday accommodation''' is a type of [[accommodation]]. People who [[travel]] and stay away from home for more than a day need '''lodging''' mainly for [[sleep]]ing. Other purposes are safety, [[shelter]] from [[cold]] and [[rain]], and to have a place to store [[luggage]] and being able to take a shower. 
 
 They do that in a [[hotel]], [[hostel]] or hostal, a private home (for example, a [[bed and breakfast]] or [[guest house]] place), in a [[tent]], or a caravan/[[Camping|camper]] (often on a [[campsite]]).  
 
 Lodging may also refer to when [[cereal]] [[crops]] fall over, often due to [[wind]] or [[rain]] [[pressure]], making [[grain]] [[harvest]] difficult.
