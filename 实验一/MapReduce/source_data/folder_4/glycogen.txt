[[File:Glycogen.png|thumb|Structure of Glycogen]] 
 '''Glycogen''' is a [[polysaccharide]] that is the principal storage form of [[glucose]] in animal [[cell]]s.  
 
 Glycogen is found in the form of [[granule]]s in the [[cytosol]] in many cell types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose]] cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of [[triglycerides]]. Only the glycogen stored in the [[liver]] can be made accessible to other organs.
