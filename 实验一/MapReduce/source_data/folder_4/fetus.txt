 A '''fetus''' or '''foetus''' is the stage that an [[organism]] goes through before it is born as a baby. In [[human]]s a fetus is the stage (time of [[development]]) after the [[embryo]]nic stage, and begins during the third to eighth week of development after [[fertilization]] of the egg. The ''fetal'' stage lasts from 8 weeks after fertilization to birth. This stage can also take 9-12 weeks, if any mutations happen.
