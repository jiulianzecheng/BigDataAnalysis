 '''Fraternity''' is some kind of [[morality]], [[ethics]] or [[idea]]. A synonym of ''fraternity'' is ''brotherhood''. 
 
 Fraternity is adopted for the national [[motto]] of [[France]],  " Liberty, Equality, Fraternity " . 
 
 [[Japan]]'s [[prime minister]] Ichiro Hatoyama had an idea of a fraternity. The origin of his idea is the book  " The totalitarian state against man "  (original title in [[German language|German]]; {{lang|de| " Totaler Staat, totaler Mensch " }}) written by [[Count]] Richard Nikolaus Eijiro von Coudenhove-Kalergi, an [[Austria|Austrian]] [[politician]], geopolitician, and [[philosopher]]. Ichiro Hatoyama had made an effort to spread the idea of the fraternity. Ichiro's [[grandchildren|grandchild]] [[Yukio Hatoyama]] also has become the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister of Japan]]. Yukio Hatoyama has taken over the idea of his [[grandparent|grandfather]] Ichiro's. The family of Hatoyama's fraternity means {{nihongo| " Yūai " |友愛}} in Japanese.
