 The Nongsaba Laihui (Nongshaba Laihui) describes the greatness of God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) as follows: 
 {{blockquote|''“Thou, Lord of Gods and Goddesses together with the exalted Awang Phatlou Laimakhomba (Sanamahi), like two strands of the thread entwined, exercise Thine sway over the earth and in doing so effulgent rays radiate from Thee. Thus with the reflected light, all other divine beings take on a dazzling look and are then made to stand guard at the four corners, eight directions and sixteen sub-directions. All the souls of the living creatures emanate from Thee and again like beads of gold strung together Thou art in complete harmony with Nongda Lairen Pakhangba who can be a man in the night and a God during the day. There Thou takest Thine name as Chinglen Nongdai Ningthou and with Thine consort Thongnang Leicha Khombi, Thou becomest like innumerable Suns among the myriad stars… On both of Thee attend the God of the death and the God of the westerly directions, who hold ornamental receptacles for delicacies. And the enchanting seven goddesses gently play the fans made of peacock feathers for Thy pleasure. O Powerful One!
