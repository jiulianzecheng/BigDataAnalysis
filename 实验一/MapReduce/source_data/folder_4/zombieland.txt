 A cowardly shut-in named Columbus ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) is forced to join up with a seasoned zombie slayer named Tallahassee ([[Woody Harrelson]]) in order to survive the zombie apocalypse. As Tallahassee sets out on a mission to find the last Twinkie on Earth, the duo meets up with Wichita ([[Emma Stone]]) and Little Rock ([[Abigail Breslin]]), two young girls who have resorted to some rather unorthodox methods to survive amidst the chaos.
