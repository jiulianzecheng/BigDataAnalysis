 '''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in [[taste]]) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). 
 
 Other sorts are  " French andouille "  and  " German andouille " ; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over [[pecan]] wood and sugar [[cane]] for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).
