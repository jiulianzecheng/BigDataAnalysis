 '''Taxanes''' are [[poison]]ous [[alkaloid]]s produced by [[Yew]] plants. 
 
 Alkaloids are natural [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[chemical compound]]s which contain [[nitrogen]] atoms. < ref > IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the  " Gold Book " ). Compiled by A.D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford 1997. XML on-line corrected version: http://goldbook.iupac.org (2006-) created by M. Nic, J. Jirat, B. Kosata; updates compiled by A. Jenkins. {{ISBN|0-9678550-9-8}}. doi:10.1351/goldbook. < /ref >  The name comes from the word [[alkaline]] and was used to describe any alkaline containing nitrogen. 
 
 Alkaloids are made by a large variety of organisms, but taxanes are produced only by plants of the [[genus]] ''[[Taxus]]''. 
 
 Taxanes work mainly by disrupting the function of [[cell]] [[microtubule]]s. Microtubules are essential to [[cell division]], so taxanes are essentially [[mitosis|mitotic]] [[inhibition|inhibitor]]s. This explains why taxanes have been used to produce [[chemotherapy]] drugs. < ref > Takimoto CH, Calvo E.
