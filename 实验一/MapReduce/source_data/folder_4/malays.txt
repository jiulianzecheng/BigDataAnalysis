 The '''Malays''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]-{{lang-id|Melayu}}; {{lang-fil|Malayo}}; [[Rejang script|Rejang]]: ꤷꥁꤼ; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{lang|ar|ملايو}}) are an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] [[ethnic group]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. They mainly live in the Maritime Southeast Asia region (especially within the [[Malay Archipelago]]; consist of [[Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]] and [[Philippines|Philippines archipelago]]), such as [[Sumatra]], [[Riau Islands]], [[Singapore]], [[Borneo|Kalimantan]]{{refn|group=note|Kalimantan is the native name of [[Borneo]] island}} (including [[Brunei]]), southern [[Thailand]], and southern [[Philippines]]. 
 
 == Overview == 
 Malay people were once a tribal group who inhabited the island of [[Sumatra]]. According to the Malay Annals, the origin of Malay people are from the area known as [[Palembang]] in modern-day [[South Sumatra]]. 
 {{cquote|''... Here now is the story of a city called [[Palembang]] in the land of [[Sumatra|Andalas]].{{refn|group=note|''Andalas'' is one of the ancient names of [[Sumatra]] island; along with ''Svarnadvipa'' and ''Bhumi Melayu''.}} It was ruled by Demang Lebar Daun, a descendant of Raja Shulan, and its river was the Muara Tatang. In the upper reaches of the Muara Tatang was a river called Melayu, and on that river was a hill called Siguntang Mahameru{{refn|group=note|''Siguntang Mahameru'' is known as ''Bukit Siguntang'' nowadays in South Sumatra}} ...''}} 
 [[Sang Sapurba]] also mentioned in the Malay Annals as the King of Malays who originated from the hill of Siguntang Mahameru{{refn|group=note|''Siguntang Mahameru'' is known as ''Bukit Siguntang'' nowadays in South Sumatra}} area as well. 
 [[File:Srivijayan Expansion.gif|thumb|300px|The expansion map of the Sriwijaya empire, starting in [[Palembang]] in the 7th century, then spreading to most of [[Sumatra]], then expanding to areas of [[Java]], [[Riau Islands]], [[Bangka Belitung Islands]], [[Singapore]], Malacca Peninsula ({{aka}} Kra Peninsula), [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[South Vietnam]], Kalimantan, until it ended as the Malay Kingdom of Dharmasraya in Jambi in the 14th century.]] 
 Malay people transformed from the [[tribe|tribal group]] into an [[ethnic group]] during the glorious era of Srivijaya—the empire that originated from [[Palembang]]— when the trading activities grew. Nowadays, Malay people are inhabiting areas that was under the Srivijayan empire rule, with the big population mainly in [[Sumatra]] and its surrounding regions such as [[Bangka Belitung Islands]], [[Riau Islands]], Malacca Peninsula ({{aka}} Kra Peninsula), [[Borneo|Kalimantan]]{{refn|group=note|''Kalimantan'' is the native or indigineous name for the [[Borneo]] island}} (including [[Brunei]]), [[Thailand|southern Thailand]], [[Vietnam|southern Vietnam]], and [[Philippines|southern Philippines]]. 
 
 ==Language== 
 {{main|Malay language}} 
 Most ethnic Malays speak one or more of the many [[dialect]]s (versions) of the [[Malay language]], a language of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family of languages. In [[Indonesia]], the standardized form of [[Malay language|Malay]] is [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ({{lang|id|Bahasa Indonesia}}),These naming policies were created to form national unities in the countries instead of making the Malays a ruling influence or the ruling class. In Malaysia, the standard form is called [[Malay language|bahasa melayu]] ({{lang|ms|Bahasa Melayu}}. About 80% of their words [[Cognate|mean the same thing]] in either dialect. same like in Brunei. In [[Brunei]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]] it is also known as ''Bahasa Melayu''.  
 
 Today, the language is usually written a version of the [[Roman alphabet]], called [[Malay alphabet|Rumi]]. Malay written using the [[Arabic alphabet]] is called [[:en:Jawi_script|Jawi]], which is mostly used in official and religious contexts. Jawi is more common than Rumi in very conservative Muslim areas like [[Kelantan]] in Malaysia and [[:en:Thai_Malays|Pattani]] in Thailand. 
 
 ==Religion== 
 The vast majority of ethnic Malays today are [[Sunni Muslims]] and [[Islam]] has become a large part of the Malay identity.
