 The [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Carnivora''' is a group of [[mammal]]s. The group is divided into the  " cat-like "  [[Feliformia]] and the  " dog-like "  [[Caniformia]].  
 
 Animals of the order Carnivora are ''[[carnivore]]s'', a term which applies to all flesh-eaters. If one needs to refer to members of the order, then ''carnivorans'' is used. Many species of Carnivora are actually [[omnivore]]s, and a few of them, like the [[giant panda]], eat mostly [[plant]]s. 
 
 The order includes aquatic relatives in the [[superfamily]] [[Pinnipedia]], the [[walrus]]es and [[Pinniped|seal]]s. 
 
 == Teeth == 
 Mammalian carnivores have a particular arrangement of their back teeth. It is to slice the meat of their prey. As the photo shows, two of the back teeth work as meat slicers. If they change their way of life (various aquatic mammals) this feature gets changed or even lost (selected against). < ref name=Wang2008 > {{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Xiaoming|last2=Tedford|first2=Richard H.|title=Dogs: their fossil relatives and evolutionary history |publisher=Columbia University Press, New York|year=2008|pages=1|isbn=978-0-231-13529-0|oclc=502410693|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=LnWdpK7ctI0C|page=1}}}} < /ref >

 === Carnivoramorpha === 
 The Carnivores are linked with the Miacids and Viverravids in an unranked clade, the Carnivoramorpha: 
 *†[[Miacoidea]] 
 **†[[Viverravidae]] 
 **†[[Miacidae]] (''[[Miacis]]'') 
 *Carnivora 
 **[[Caniformia]] 
 **[[Feliformia]] 
 
 The carnivores known as †[[Creodont]]s have some relation to these groups, but are placed outside the Carnivoramorpha. The †[[Mesonychid]]s are another extinct group of early carnivores, which are also not in the Carnivoramorpha.
