 A '''Hyperloop''' is a proposed type of [[train]] that would travel at very high speeds.  The reason it can travel so fast is because it is inside a tube with no air.  This [[vacuum]] means that there will be no [[friction]] to slow the train. 
 
 The Hyperloop is being created and tested in various places around the world, for example the [[United States]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]]. 
 
 In 2012, [[Elon Musk]] ([[Tesla Motors]], [[SpaceX]]) proposed this technology. In 2013, he put a plan online that showed the hyperloop train taking 35 minutes to go between [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]] in the United States. He shared this technology to the world.  In 2015, Musk's company built a {{convert|1.6|km|abbr=off}} [[test tube]].  He asked universities and companies to make the test trains.  They had two competitions in 2017 to see how fast the hyperloop trains could travel.  The fastest test was {{convert|324|kph|abbr=off}}. 
 
 == Possible advantages   == 
 
 * The hyperloop will be faster than cars, buses and regular trains.  Elon Musk suggests that it may be possible to travel over {{convert|700|kph|abbr=off}}. 
 * The hyperloop will be [[eco-friendly]] compared to a lot of current transportation.  Most plans for building the hyperloop use solar power to run the system. 
 * The hyperloop is a free and open-source technology.  Elon Musk put the plans online for anyone to use and asked people to improve the technology 
 * Because the hyperloop trains run inside of a tube, they will not be affected by [[weather]] such as snow or [[fog]]. 
 
 == Possible disadvantages == 
 
 * Building costs will probably be very high.  It is predicted that the Los Angeles to San Fransisco hyperloop would cost between 6 and 7.5 billion USD to build. 
 * The trains will vibrate at a high speed which may cause passengers problems such as [[dizziness]] or stomach upset. 
 * Passengers will not be able to move while the hyperloop is traveling. As in a [[rapid transit]] system, there will be no access to toilets during trips.
