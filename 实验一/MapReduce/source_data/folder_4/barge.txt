 A '''barge''' is a simple looking boat with a flat surface and long structure. Barges usually [[transport]] goods to different places. 
 
 In Great Britain, during the [[Industrial Revolution]], a substantial network of narrow barges was developed from 1750 onwards. 
 
 From 1825 there was competition from the [[railway]]s. Eventually the British rail system took over from canal traffic due to the higher speed, falling [[cost]] < nowiki/ > s and route flexibility of [[rail transport]]. 
 
 Barges carrying bulk and heavy cargoes continue to be viable. There is no cheaper way to move really heavy loads. Originally, British canals had locks only {{convert|7|ft|spell=in||}} wide, so '''narrowboats''' could be no more than 6'10 "  wide if they were to be able to navigate the system. It was soon realised that narrow locks were too limiting, and later locks were doubled in width to {{convert|14|ft|spell=in||}}.  
 
 On the British canal system the term 'barge' is used to describe a  " Thames [sailing barge], Duch [barge], or other styles of [[barge]] " . The people who move barges are often known as lightermen. < ref > {{cite web |title=All craft great and small |website=Canal  &  River Trust |date=28 January 2019 |url=https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/enjoy-the-waterways/boating/getting-afloat/all-craft-great-and-small |ref={{sfnref|''Canal  &  River Trust''|2019}}|access-date=21 January 2020}} < /ref >   
 
 A '''narrowboat''' is a particular type of canal boat, built to fit the narrow locks of the [[United Kingdom]].
