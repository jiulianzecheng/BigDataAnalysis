 A '''television set''' (also known as a '''television receiver''' or '''televisor''' or simply a '''television''', '''TV set''', '''TV receiver''' or '''TV''') is a [[machine]] with a [[screen]] or set of [[Lens (optics)|lens]]es. Televisions receive [[broadcast]]ing [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] and change them into [[picture]]s and [[sound]]. The word  " television "  comes from the words '''''tele''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for ''far away'') and '''''vision''''' (''[[sight]]''). 
 
 Sometimes a television can look like a [[box]]. Older TVs had a large [[cathode ray tube]] in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like [[furniture]].  Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.  
 
 A TV can show pictures from many [[television network]]s.  [[Computer]]s and [[mobile device]]s also can be used for watching [[television program]]s. 
 
 The television was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread. 
 
 At first, all televisions used an [[antenna]] (or aerial). This would pick up [[television programme]]s from [[broadcasting]] stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from [[VCD]] and [[DVD]] players or [[VCR]]s. [[Cable TV]] and [[Satellite television]] can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. [[Video game console]]s connect to most modern TVs. Some [[computer]]s can also use a TV as a [[computer monitor]]. 
 
 All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed.  Before the 1950s these were usually  " [[Monochrome|black and white]] " , which made everything look grey, but all modern TVs show colors.  Most 20th century screens also had rounded corners.  That is because television screens were [[cathode ray tube]]s.  These are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen.   
 
 Today [[flat panel display]]s are the usual kind.  These are usually flat rectangles with straight edges.  This long rectangle looks more like the shape of a [[movie theatre]] screen.  This is called [[widescreen]].  If a widescreen set was 30 & nbsp;cm tall, it would be 53 & nbsp;cm wide.  For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen.  Widescreen sets can still be any size, but they have the same widescreen shape. 
 
 The early 21st century is also when [[digital television]] transmission became more common than [[analog television]].
