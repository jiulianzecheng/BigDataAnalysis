 '''Judea''' or '''Judaea''' ({{lang-he|יהודה}}, ''Yehudah'') is the ancient name of the [[mountain]]ous surrounding [[Jerusalem]]. Its location falls in present-day [[Israel]] and the [[Palestine|Palestinian]] [[West Bank]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 === Ancient Judea === 
 Judea was the territory of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Judea lost its [[Nationhood]] to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the [[1st century BC]], by becoming first a [[tribute|tributary]] kingdom, then a [[Roman province|province]], of the [[Roman Empire]].  
 
 The first interference of Rome in the region dates from 63 BC, following the end of the [[Third Mithridatic war]].  
 
 After the defeat of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], general [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (Pompey the Great) stayed behind to make the area secure for Rome. Judea at the time was not a peaceful place. Queen Alexandra had recently died, and her sons were troubling the country with a [[civil war]] for power. They were [[Hyrcanus]] and [[Aristobulus]].  
 
 In 63 BC, Aristobulus was surrounded in Jerusalem by his brother's armies, and the situation was bad. He sent a messenger to [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]], Pompey's representative in the area. Aristobulus offered a large [[bribe]] to be rescued, that Pompey quickly accepted, but later, he tried to accuse Scaurus of [[extortion]]. This caused his downfall, because Scaurus was Pompey's brother in law and was protected by him. The general did not like what Aristobulus had done, and put the prince and high priest Hyrcanus in charge of the kingdom. Judea and [[Galilee]] became tributary kingdoms of Rome, which meant that they had to pay tribute to the [[Roman Republic]] to buy their protection.  
 
 ==== After Caesar's death ==== 
 Around the same time Pompey was defeated by [[Julius Caesar]], Hyrcanus was followed by a member of his court, [[Antipater]]. Caesar and Antipater were both killed in 44 BC, and Herod, Antipater's son, was appointed as governor (''tetrarch'') by Rome in 41 BC. He became the king (''basileus'') of Judea in 37 BC, and was known as King [[Herod the Great]]. During his reign, the great port of [[Caesarea]] Maritima was built. He died in 4 BC, and his kingdom was divided among his sons. One of these was [[Herod Archelaus]], who ruled Judea so badly that he was made to quit in 6 AD by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus Caesar]], after his own people complained about him.  
 
 The kingdom of Judea now became part of a larger Roman province of ''Ivdaea''. This was one of the few governed by a [[knight]], not a former [[Roman consul|consul]] or ''[[praetor]]'' of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank, because its income to the Roman treasury was small, and the region was peaceful. [[Pontius Pilate]] was one of these [[procurator]]s. 
 
 Between 41 and 44, Judea won a little more independence again, when [[Herod Agrippa]] was made king by emperor [[Claudius]]. After Agrippa's died, the province again went to direct Roman control for a short time. Judea was returned little by little to Agrippa's son, [[Agrippa II|Marcus Julius Agrippa]], in 48. However, there was still a Roman procurator in the area, responsible for keeping peace and raising taxes. When he died, around the year 100, the area returned once again to direct Roman control. 
 
 ==== Rebellions ==== 
 Judea was the stage of three major rebellions against the Romans. They were (see [[Judea rebellions]] for a full account): 
 
 *66-70 - first rebellion, followed by the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] and the [[Temple]] (see [[Great Jewish Revolt]], [[Josephus]]) 
 *115-117 - second rebellion, because of too much taxation 
 *132-135 - third rebellion, led by [[Simon Bar Kokhba]] 
 After Bar Kokhba's revolt was stopped by the Roman forces, the emperor [[Hadrian#Hadrian in Judea|Hadrian]] changed the name of the province to ''[[Syria Palaestina]]'', and Jerusalem became ''[[Aelia Capitolina]]'' in order to embarrass the [[Jew]]ish people by attempting to erase the nation's name from the region.
