 '''''Cymbospondylus''''' (meaning  " boat vertebrae " ) was a large, primitive [[Triassic]] [[ichthyosaur]] of the [[Middle Triassic|Middle]] and [[Upper Triassic]]. It had a long [[eel]]-like body up to 10 meters or more in length. < ref > Motani R. 1999: Phylogeny of the Ichthyopterygia. ''Journal Of Vertebrate Paleontology''. '''19''' (3): 473 - 496 < /ref > 
 
 ''Cymbospondylus'' is known from both [[Germany]] and [[Nevada]]. No doubt, like other large marine [[reptile]]s and present-day aquatic [[mammal]]s, it had a wide oceanic distribution.

 ''Cymbospondylus'' was one of the largest ichthyosaurs. Fossils ranging from {{convert|6|to|10|m|ft}} long. < ref name= " bbc " > {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/seamonsters/factfiles/cymbospondylus.shtml|title=Cymbospondylus|accessdate=2009-05-25|publisher=BBC - Science  &  Nature}} < /ref >  It was also one of the least fish-like of the ichthyosaurs, lacking a [[dorsal fin]] and fluked tail. It did, however, have an elongated snout like other ichthyosaurs. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= [https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7/page/78 78]|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref > 
 
 The one metre long head of ''Cymbospondylus'', < ref name= " bbc "  / >  with large jaws, contained rows of teeth adapted for catching and holding on to fish, [[belemnite]]s, and [[cephalopod]]s such as [[ammonite]]s. The long tail would have been excellent for swimming, and allowed ''Cymbospondylus'' to move at fast speeds and efficiently hunt down shoals of swimming fish. 
 
 Adult ''Cymbospondylus'' probably spent much of their time hunting in deep offshore water, only coming into shallow water to breed or to catch seasonally available prey. Like other ichthyosaurs, ''Cymbospondylus'' probably gave birth to live young, as it had no way to lay eggs. < ref name= " bbc "  / >  These, on reaching adult size, probably had few, if any, predators that could harm them. 
 
 The eel-like tail of ''Cymbospondylus'' made up almost half the total body length, and it is possible that the tail was used as a primary swimming mechanism. Like present day [[sea snake]]s, ''Cymbospondylus'' probably swam by wriggling its body from side to side. < ref name=EoDP/ >
