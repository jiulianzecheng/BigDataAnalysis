{{Judaism}} 
 A '''kippah''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) or '''yarmulke''' ([[Yiddish]]) is a small [[cloth]] [[cap]] worn by [[Judaism|Jews]].  
 Traditionally it was worn only by men, but in modern times the push for equality between the sexes in the practice of [[Judaism]] has led some women to wear yarmulkes. Some Jews only wear yarmulkes while [[pray]]ing; others wear yarmulkes the entire day, making sure not to walk more than four [[cubit]]s without head covering (especially outside). 
 The basis for wearing a head covering is a story in the [[Talmud]] (tractate Shabbat).

 Often, the color and fabric of the ''yarmulke'' can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement. The Israeli [[Mafdal|National Religious]] community is often referred to by the name ''kipot srugot'' כיפות סרוגות, literally  " woven yarmulkes " . Similarly, some [[Haredi]] sects are referred to by the name ''kipot shkhorot'' כיפות שחורות, literally  " black yarmulkes " .

 == Etymology == 
 The etymology of ''yarmulke'' is unclear. Linguists (e.g. [[Max Vasmer]]) maintain that the [[Yiddish]] word is derived (via [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Polish language|Polish]]) from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] ''{{lang|trk|yağmurluk}}'', meaning 'raincoat'. 
 
 Traditionally, ''yarmulke'' is considered to have originated from the [[Aramaic]] phrase  " ''{{lang|arc|yarei mei-elokah}}'' "  (in awe of the Lord), in keeping with the principle that the yarmulke is supposed to reflect someone's fear of heaven. Or perhaps,  " ''yira malkah'' "  (fear of the King).
