 '''Excellency''' is an [[honorific style]] that is given to members of a certain organization or state, usually a [[president]] or [[governor]]. Once a person gets the title of  " Excellency "  it is usually held by that person for the rest of their life though this is not always the case. For example some countries presidents get the title of  " Excellency "  but only hold it for their time in that office.
