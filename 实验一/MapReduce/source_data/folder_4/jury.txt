 A '''jury''' is a group of ordinary people, who aren't employees of the court, who decide the answer to a question in a court room. Usually, this question is whether a person is [[guilty]] or [[innocent]] of committing a [[crime]]. A jury may also be responsible for deciding a [[punishment|penalty]] for the person if they are found guilty. Normally, all members of the jury have to agree on the decision. Sometimes, the jury can still make a decision even if a few members don't agree with it. However, if the jury is quite clearly divided, the result is known as a ''hung jury'' and the case is not decided. A member of a jury is called a '''juror'''. A juror is supposed to be impartial. This means that he or she is to be fair and listen to both sides of the story without deciding what side they will take ahead of time. Some people can not become members of a jury and others have the right to ask not to be made a member. People who can not be members are those which have a mental illness and people who can ask not to be made a juror include doctors and religious persons. 
 
 ==Jury Nullification== 
 Under the [[common law]] juries have a right that is not often used. If they think that the law under which a person is charged is wrong they can use jury nullification to set the person free. Whilst this is a right juries have it is unlawful for a lawyer to explain this to a jury, they must know about it on their own. 
 
 == Types of juries == 
 In the [[United States]] there are primarily two types of juries which are the [[Trier of fact|finder of facts]] in a trial: < ref name=USCourts > {{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/jury-service/types-juries |title=Types of Juries |author= |website= |publisher=United States Courts |accessdate=28 March 2016}} < /ref > 
 * A '''petit jury''' also called a '''trial jury''' is one made up of from 6 to 12 jurors. < ref name=USCourts/ > 
 * A '''[[grand jury]]''' is called by a [[prosecutor]] to decide if there is [[probable cause]] to believe someone has committed a crime. If so, the grand jury returns an [[indictment]] against the defendant. < ref name=USCourts/ > 
 
 ==Juries by country== 
 
 A jury in the United Kingdom is made up of 12 people for criminal cases and 10 people for civil cases (or 15 people in [[Scotland]]) these people are selected at random and are British citizens with no criminal record. Members are chosen from the electoral register for their local area and those chosen must attend jury duty. 
 
 In the [[United States]], juries are made up of 12 regular people from the area in which the trial is held and are not members of the court system. They are paid a small amount for their service.
