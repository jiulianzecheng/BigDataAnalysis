 '''Malmesbury''' is a [[market town]] in north [[Wiltshire]], just south of the [[Cotswolds]]. The town became popular during the [[Middle Ages]] as the [[abbey]] as a center for learning. It is the oldest [[borough]] in [[England]]. Malmesbury was created by a charter of [[Alfred the Great]] about 880 AD. < ref > [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/malmesbury_01.shtml Malmesbury: England's Oldest Borough, ''BBC History''] < /ref >  It was once the site of an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]. < ref > [http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/765500.iron_age_remains_uncovered_by_archaeologists/ Iron Age remains uncovered by archaeologists, ''Swindon Adviser'' (Thursday, 26 December 2013)] < /ref >
