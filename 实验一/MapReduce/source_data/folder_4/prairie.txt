A '''prairie''' is a type of [[habitat]] with mostly [[grass]]es, but also flowering plants and occasional shrubs or isolated trees. < ref > {{cite web|title=Illinois Prairies|url=http://dnr.state.il.us/education/podcasts/textfiles/prairies%20podcast.htm|publisher=Illinois DNR|accessdate=8 April 2013|archive-date=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208122954/http://dnr.state.il.us/education/Podcasts/textfiles/prairies%20podcast.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This type of habitat can be found around the world, but it goes by different names, such as [[steppe]]s in Asia. What attracts tourists is the golden grass in prairie grassland. The word 'prairie' generally means grasslands in [[North America]]. There are often many animals on a prairie. They either prefer a prairie or can only live in a prairie. Well-known are the [[American bison]] (also called the buffalo) and the [[pronghorn]] [[antelope]]. Birds include the [[bobolink]] and the [[meadowlark]].

 == Tall grass prairie == 
 A ''tall grass prairie'' has plants and grasses that typically grow three to seven feet (one to two meters) high, with occasional plants growing higher.  This type of prairie grows in areas with a good amount of [[rain]].  [[Illinois]] (the ''prairie state''), [[Indiana]] and [[Iowa]] are good examples of where a tall grass prairie would be.  This type of habitat usually has rich soil and is very good for farming.  Much of the original prairie has been changed into crops or lost to brush and trees. 
 
 Trees can grow in this area, but most were stopped by fires that swept through. Some [[oak]]s and hickories could survive a prairie fire. If there are scattered trees, it is called a [[savanna]], and an area in a prairie where trees grew closer together is called a [[grove]]. In the last century, fires have been stopped, and trees and brush that once did not grow in prairies are taking over. Some of these [[invasive species]] were accidentally introduced from [[Europe]] or elsewhere. In [[Illinois]], less than 0.01% of the original prairie still exists. < ref > {{cite web|title=Midewin Prairie Restoration|url=http://www.nationalforests.org/conserve/programs/conservation/midewin-tallgrass-prairie-restoration|publisher=NationalForests.org|accessdate=8 April 2013|archive-date=17 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917080642/http://www.nationalforests.org/conserve/programs/conservation/midewin-tallgrass-prairie-restoration|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  For this reason, [[conservationist]]s in this area practice [[prairie restoration]] to keep the prairie in good condition. 
 
 == Short grass prairie ==

 ''Short grass prairie'' is in drier areas, and is usually one to two feet (0.3 to 0.6 meters) high and has more space between plants. The ''American West'' (from central Texas up into Canada, East of the arid semi-[[desert]]) is all short grass prairie. Much of this area is converted to [[pasture]]s for grazing cows and sheep. Areas near rivers are [[irrigation|irrigated]] for crops. Some of the original native plants are still widespread. 
 
 ==Mixed grass prairie== 
 Mixed grass prairie is found between the short grass prairie and the tall grass prairie and contains more species than either the short grass prairie or the tall grass prairie.
