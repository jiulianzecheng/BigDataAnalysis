 '''''Eryops'''''  < ref > meaning  " drawn-out face "  because most of its skull was in front of its eyes ([[Greek language|Greek]] ερυειν, ''eryein'' = drawn-out + ωψ, ''ops'' = face) < /ref >  is a [[genus]] of [[extinct]], semi-aquatic [[temnospondyl]]. 
 
 They are found mostly in the Lower [[Permian]]-aged (about 295 & nbsp;million years ago) [[red beds]] of [[Texas]]. [[Fossil]]s are also found in [[New Mexico]] and parts of the eastern [[United States]]. ''Eryops'' also occurs in older [[Pennsylvanian]] [[strata]] of the Conemaugh Group in West Virginia  < ref > Murphy, James L. 1971. Eryopsid remains from the Conemaugh Group, Braxton County, West Virginia. ''Southeastern Geology''. '''13''' (4): 265-273. < /ref > 
 
 ''Eryops'' averaged a little over 1.5-2.0 & nbsp;meters (5–6.5 & nbsp;ft) long, so it was one of the largest land animals of its time.  It weighed about 90 & nbsp;kilograms (200 & nbsp;lb). It probably had few predators, although the [[apex predator]] of the time was the [[synapsid]] ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', which was even larger. Several complete [[skeleton]]s of ''Eryops'' have been found in the Lower Permian, but [[skull]] bones and [[teeth]] are the most common [[fossil]]s. 
 
 ''Eryops'' was better adapted to a [[terrestrial]] environment than its ancestors. Sturdy limbs and a strong spine supported the body while out of water.
