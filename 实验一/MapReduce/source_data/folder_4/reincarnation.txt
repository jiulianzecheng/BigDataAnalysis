 '''Reincarnation''' is the name of the idea that people are born again  in another body after they [[death|die]] and this cycle continues over many lifetimes. [[Rebirth]] or  " transmigration "  is the preferred term for those believers who do not believe in eternal [[soul]]s. Many [[Hindu]]s, [[Jainism|Jainists]], Celtic pagans, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and people who follow some African religions believe in reincarnation or rebirth/ transmigration. Carnate means “of flesh”, and reincarnate means to “reenter the flesh " . 
 
 ==Belief in reincarnation or rebirth/transmigration== 
 The belief is held in many religions except [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], although 20 to 30 percent of Christians in western countries also believe in reincarnation. < ref name=book/ > 
 
 Ethnologists have documented the belief among nearly all the traditional religions of ethnic groups in Africa, North and South America, and Australia/Oceania.  The tribes of north-west North America continue to believe in reincarnation despite negative attitudes towards it on the part of Christian missionaries and churches. < ref name =  " book " > {{cite book| last = Henry| first = Jane| title = Parapsychology: Research on Exceptional Experiences| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EaIhapm-4UgC| year = 2005| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-21360-8| page = 224 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Reincarnation in Hinduism == 
 [[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|190px|thumb|Drawing of reincarnation in Hindu art]] 
 [[Hindu]]s believe in reincarnation, the process where the [[soul]] repeatedly takes on a physical body through being born on [[Earth]]. Ancient scriptures of [[Hinduism]] starting around 700 & nbsp;BC teach that the [[soul]], or immortal “self”, takes [[birth]] time and time again. The soul survives and continues its long journey until it is one with [[God]]. Hindus believe that the soul never dies, but inhabits one [[body]] after another during its evolutionary journey guided by karma. [[Karma]] (literally: [[action]]) is the sum of one's actions, and the [[force]] that determines one's next reincarnation. 
 
 The soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual [[illumination]]. Therefore, each reincarnating soul chooses a home and a family which can best fulfill its next step of learning and maturation. Each life on [[Earth]] is similar to a class in school. Maturation of the [[soul]] on Earth means fulfilling its worldly desires, which can only be experienced through a body. < ref > See Bhagavad Gita XVI.8-20 < /ref > 
 
 At death the [[soul]] leaves the physical body. But the soul does not die. It lives on in a subtle body called the astral body. The astral body exists in a nonphysical [[dimension]] called the astral plane. Here the [[soul]] continues to have experiences until it is born again in another physical body as a baby. < ref > Satguru [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]],  " ''Ten Questions people ask About Hinduism …and ten terrific answers!'' "  (p. 4) [http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/tenq/hindu10questions.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411180040/http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/tenq/hindu10questions.pdf |date=2007-04-11 }} < /ref > 
 
 After many lifetimes of following [[dharma]] (right way of living), the soul is fully matured in love, wisdom and knowledge of [[God]]. There is no longer a need for physical [[birth]], for all lessons have been learned, all karmas fulfilled. When all desire has vanished, the person will not be born again anymore. < ref > {{cite book| last = Rinehart| first = Robin| title = Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice| url = https://archive.org/details/contemporaryhind0000unse_x1k0| year = 2004| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 1-57607-905-8 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Reincarnation research== 
 {{Main|Reincarnation research}} 
 [[Ian Stevenson]] found that the best research evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who, typically between the ages of 2 and 5, make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born. < ref name =  " st225 " > {{cite book| last = Henry| first = Jane| title = Parapsychology: Research on Exceptional Experiences| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EaIhapm-4UgC| year = 2005| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-21360-8| page = 225 }} < /ref >  Some 35 per cent of the children also have birthmarks or birth defects which often correspond to injuries or illness experienced by the deceased person who the subject remembers. Medical documents have confirmed this correspondence in more than forty cases. < ref name= " book " / >
