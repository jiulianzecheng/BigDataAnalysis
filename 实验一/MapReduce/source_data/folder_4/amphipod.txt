 The '''Amphipod'''s are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[malacostraca]]n [[crustacean]]s. They have no [[carapace]].  
 
 The name ''amphipoda'' means  " different-footed " . Unlike [[isopod]]s, where all the legs are alike, amphipods have different [[appendage]] types.   
 
 Of the 7,000 species, 5,500 are classified into one suborder, the [[Gammaridea]]. The rest are in two or three other suborders.  
 
 Amphipods range in size from  0.1 to 34 centimetres (0.04 to 13 inches) and are mostly [[detritivore]]s or [[scavenger]]s. They live in almost all [[aquatic]] environments; 750 species live in [[cave]]s and the order also includes [[Land|terrestrial]] animals and [[sandhopper]]s such as ''Talitrus saltator''. The largest amphipods live on the sea floor, seven kilometres down. < ref > Morelle, Rebecca 2012.
