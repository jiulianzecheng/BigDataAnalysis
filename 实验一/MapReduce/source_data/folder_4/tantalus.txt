'''Tantalus''' was a [[Human|mortal]] [[king]] in [[Greek mythology]]. He did many bad things against the [[deity|gods and goddesses]]. At a [[banquet]], he tried to feed people the [[flesh]] of his son [[Pelops]]. He had asked the gods and goddesses to come to this banquet. When they learn what he had planned, they [[punishment|punished]] Tantalus in not only this world (the world of the living), but the next as well (the world of the dead). Tantalus's punishment while he was alive was the [[wikt:destroy|ruin]] of his [[kingdom]]. His punishment when dead in the [[Tartaros]] of the [[Underworld]] was much worse. 
 
 He was made to stand in a [[Pond|pool]] of [[water]] up to his [[chin]] for all time. During this, he would always be [[wikt:hunger|hungry]] and [[wikt:thirst|thirsty]]. Each time Tantalus lowered his head to drink the water he was standing in, the water would lower. Over his head hung [[branch]]es of [[tree]]s filled with [[fruit]]. When he would try to get them, [[wind]] would blow them out of his reach. He was  " tantalized "  with [[food]] and drink. This is where the word tantalize comes from. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=tantalize|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-12-14}} < /ref > 
 
 His daughter is [[Niobe]]. And his son, [[Pelops]], was made alive again by the gods. He went to [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and became the ruler of the [[peninsula]] which still has his name, the [[Peloponesus]].
