 '''Natanz''' is a city in the [[arid]] center of [[Iran]]. The city lies in an [[oasis]] in the [[desert]]. The city is located about {{convert|40|km|mi}} southeast of [[Kashan]]. About 12,000 people live in the city. The city is well known for the [[pear]]s grown there. There are [[shrine]]s in the area, for example that of [[Abdas-Samad Esfahani]]. He was a [[Sufism|Sufi]] who died in Natanz in 1299 CE. King [[Darius III]] was killed in the mountains near the city, about 330 BC. The village [[Abyaneh]], near Natanz is a well-known holiday resort today. Before [[Ismail I]] made [[Twelvers|Twelver]] [[Islam]] the [[state religion]], it was a center of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Zoroastrianism originated in Iran, around 1000 BC.
