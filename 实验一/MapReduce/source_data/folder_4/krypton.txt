'''Krypton''' is a stable [[noble gas]]. It has an atomic number of 36. The name ''krypton'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''kryptos'' meaning ''hidden''. It is used in [[fluorescent lamp]]s, flashbulbs, and as a [[wavelength]] standard. The [[metre]] used to be defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths in a vacuum of krypton gas. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.webelements.com/krypton/ |title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements  |first= |last= |work=webelements.com |year=2011 |accessdate=17 June 2011}} < /ref >  {{wiktionary}}

 == Chemistry == 
 Because it is a gas, it does not react with many elements. It is clear and has no taste or smell. < ref name= " ad " > {{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/apdst/krypton |title=Krypton  |first= |last= |work=Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology |year=2006  |accessdate=17 June 2011}} < /ref >  The atmosphere is only about one millionth part krypton. < ref name= " ad "  / >  Krypton has very few [[Chemical compound|compound]]s. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 The main use for krypton is to make light. There is one main type of krypton light bulbs. This is called a [[gas discharge lamp]]. There are three main types of these. First is a low energy gas discharge lamp or  " neon light " . Low energy gas discharge lights made from krypton are near white to green. Second is a high energy short length of time gas discharge light or  " flash bulb " . These are mostly used for [[photography]]. They are bright blue-white. Third is a high energy gas discharge light. This third kind is mostly used to light airport runways. They are also bright blue-white. 
 
 ==History== 
 Krypton was found by Sir [[William Ramsay]] and [[Morris Travers]] in Great Britain in 1898. < ref > {{cite book |title=A text-book of inorganic chemistry, Volume 1 |last=Friend |first=John Newton |year=1914 |publisher=Griffin  &  Company |page=346 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hgtDAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=17 June 2011}} < /ref >  Ramsay was given the 1904 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on noble gases. < ref > {{cite book |title=Nobel laureates in chemistry, 1901â€“1992 |last=James |first=Laylin K. |year=1993 |publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] |isbn=0841226903 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEy67gEvIuMC |accessdate=17 June 2011}} < /ref >  It was a difficult gas to discover; Ramsay suspected it existed but only found it by removing other gases. < ref name=kd > {{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/05/dayintech_0530 |title=May 30, 1898: Krypton Discovered, Decades Before Superman Arrives |first=Randy |last=Alfred |work=wired.com |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=29 June 2011}} < /ref >  This is why he gave it the name Krypton. < ref name=kd/ >  There is no mineral called [[Kryptonite]] or [[planet]] called Krypton, which both feature in the [[Superman]] comics by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]. < ref name=kd/ >  The fictional planet is probably better known than the real chemical element called Krypton. < ref name=kd/ >
