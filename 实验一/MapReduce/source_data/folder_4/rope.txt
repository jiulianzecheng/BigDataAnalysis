 A '''rope''' is made out of several [[thread]]s. The [[material]] can be [[Organic matter|organic]], like [[flax]], or it can be small threads of [[steel]] (in case of a steel rope, [[wire]] or [[cable]]). A rope can be used to [[wikt:lift|lift]], or pull things, like pulling a [[ship]] into a [[harbor]] with another ship, or fixing the ship so it does not move away. The twisting of fibers in rope is what leads to its high [[tensile strength]] (meaning it's very difficult to pull apart) and this innovation allowed the rope to become a construction staple that has been used for millennia. Ropes have been used for thousands of years, from the Egyptians using them in 4000BCE and modern-day construction that relies heavily on the strength of this tool.
