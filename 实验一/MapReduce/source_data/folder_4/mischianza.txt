The '''Mischianza''' or '''Mischianza extravaganza''' was a party.  It happened in [[Philadelphia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  [[John Andre]] threw the party on May 18, 1778 for [[General William Howe]]. < ref name=USH > {{cite web|url=https://www.ushistory.org/march/bio/Andre.htm|publisher=USHistory.org|access-date=December 27, 2020|work=Virtual Marching Tour of the American Revolutionary War|title=Major John Andre|pages=1-2}} < /ref >  About 400 people came to the party < ref name=Vern > {{cite web|publisher=Mount Vernon|accessdate=July 18, 2021|url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/meschianza/|title=Meschianza|author=Mary Kate Robett}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Motivation== 
 
 The party was for General [[William Howe]] and Admiral [[Richard Howe]].  They were leaders in the British military.  William Howe was being sent back to England because the government blamed him for the loss of the [[Battle of Saratoga]].  But the men in the army thought he was a very good general and decided to throw him a large party. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 ==Event== 
 To start the party, the Howe brothers and other leaders floated down the [[Delaware river]] on decorated boats.  People in the buildings on the sides of the river waved to them.  Military musicians played music.  The ''HMS Roebuck'' fired a seventeen-gun salute. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 Most of the party was at [[Walnut Grove]].  Walnut grove had belonged to a man named [[Joseph Wharton]], but he supported the American Revolution, so the British had taken it.  Major [[John Andre]] was the [[master of ceremonies]], meaning he organized the party and told everyone what would happen next. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 Andre planned a medieval-style [[jousting|joust]], where men on horseback would practice-fight with [[lance]]s.  He named the two teams the Knights of the Blended Rose and the Knights of the Burning Mountain and designed costumes, flags, and slogans for them.  Each knight had a lady, like in the tradition of [[courtly love]] from the [[middle ages]].  Andre picked women from loyalist American families.  He gave them costumes to wear that would remind people of the [[Crusades]].  The women's costumes were what 18th-century English people thought of as [[Turkish]]. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 After the joust, the party guests walked under two [[triumphal arch]]es that Andre had built for the party.  The first arch was decorated with things about the ocean, like the Roman god [[Neptune]] with his trident.  This was to honor Admiral Howe.  The second was decorated with military trophies.  This was to honor General Howe.  Then there was dancing and [[firework]]s. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 The guests ate dinner in a beautifully decorated tent.  Twenty-four enslaved men in costumes served dinner. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 ==Costs== 
 
 Twenty-two British officers got the money for the party: £3,312.  This did not count the costumes people wore, which cost about £12,000. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 ==Response== 
 
 Most of the people who went to and wrote about the Meschianza said how beautiful and elegant everything was.  However, other people did not like that the officers had celebrated a triumph, or victory, before the war was won. < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 Richard Howe's secretary, Ambrose Serle wrote,  " Every man of Sense, among ourselves, tho’ not unwilling to pay a due Respect, was ashamed of this mode of doing it. " < ref name=Vern / > 
 
 A [[Quaker]] named Elizabeth Drinker wrote that she did not like the idea of throwing a big party when so many people were being hurt by the war:  " How insensible these people appear, while our land is so greatly desolated, and death and sore destruction has overtaken and impends over so many.
