 '''''Ceratosaurus''''' was a [[predator]]y [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Jurassic]] period, 156 to 145 million years ago.  
 
 It was first described by [[O.C. Marsh]] in 1884. It had a horn on its nose, and a pair of small horns above its eyes. Unusually, for a [[theropod]], ''Ceratosaurus'' had armour: small [[osteoderm]]s ran down the middle of its back. 
 
 The animal had deep jaws and long blade-like teeth. A nearly complete skeleton was discovered in Garden Park, [[Colorado]], in rocks belonging to the [[Morrison Formation]].Other examples or close relatives have since been found.Ceratosaurus was a midle sized carnivorus dinosaur found in the jurassic period.Cerastosaurus was known for the large horns on the top of its head.Ceratosaurus was in the same time as the allosaurus,stegosaurus and many more.Ceratosaurus was ranged from 9.2 meters long to 11.6 meters long. 
 
 This made it a fast and dependable predator.Ceratosaurs had 4 fingers mostly used for grabing\clutching objects.Ceratosaurus teeth were around 1.7-2.1 inches tall. Scientists have found bite marks of ceratosaurus in many dinosaurs including,allosaurus,stegosaurus and more.
