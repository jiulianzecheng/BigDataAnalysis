 '''Accessibility''' is  equal access for people with [[Disability|disabilities]] to any environment, movement, information or communication. It means that a person with a disability should be able to use a product or service to access society at the same level as a person without a disability.  
 
 Examples of accessibility include: 
 
 * Buildings that have access ramps for people in [[Wheelchair|wheelchairs]] or motorised scooters 
 * Close captioning on television and subtitles on DVDs for people who cannot hear 
 * [[Sign language]] that allows deaf people to communicate other people 
 * [[Braille]] for people with a vision impairment to help them read books 
 * Modified computer [[software]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]] that allows people with a disability or disabilities to access the [[Internet]] and use a personal computer 
 
 The word ''accessibility'' is used in the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], mostly in article 9. 
 
 Having accessible ramps and parking is very important for the people who struggle with disabilities.
