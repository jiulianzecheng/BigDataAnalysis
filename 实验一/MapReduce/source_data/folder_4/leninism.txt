 '''Leninism''' is a way of thinking about how the communist party should be organized. It says it should be a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (the working class holds the power). It is thought to be one of the first steps towards [[socialism]] (where the workers own the factories, etc.). < ref name= " Modern Thought Third Edition 1999 pp. 476 " > ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999) pp. 476–477. < /ref >  It is one part of [[Marxism–Leninism]], which emphasizes the transition from capitalism to socialism.

 [[Vladimir Lenin]] was a Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]]. He had a set of ideas based on [[Marxism]]. Lenin's development of Marxism has become known as '''Leninism'''. These ideas include: 
 
 * [[Democratic Centralism]], also known as an idea of the vanguard party.  Like other [[Communism|communists]],  Lenin wanted to see a socialist revolution led by the [[working class]].  But he thought the [[worker]]s needed strong leadership in the form of a Revolutionary Party based on Democratic Centralism.  Lenin wanted Communist [[political party|political parties]] in every country to lead the revolution.  He thought the vanguard party would need to have strong discipline, or it would fail. 
 * The idea that [[capitalism]] is the cause of [[imperialism]] (empire-building). He thought that imperialism was the  " highest stage "  of capitalism. 
 * Accepting the idea that the oppressed ethnic minorities (smaller groups of people) should get to have [[Nationalism]] and decide how they should be governed. < ref > Lenin, V.I.
