'''Catastrophism''' is the idea that [[Earth]] has been affected in the past by sudden, short-lived, violent events. Catastrophes, possibly worldwide in scope, came between long periods of quiet inactivity. This was called 'catastrophism' by [[William Whewell]] in 1837. < ref > Whewell W. 1847. ''Philosophy of the inductive sciences'', new edition, part 1, Book X, Chapter III 'Of the doctrine of Catastrophes and the doctrine of Uniformity'. John W. Parker, London. p605  < /ref > 
 
 Catastrophes were thought to be the main cause of the changes seen in the record of the [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[fossil]]s. This record appeared to show that the Earth had suffered occasional gigantic upheavals in what was otherwise a quiet planet. 
 
 Supporting this view was the greatest [[comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist]] and [[palaeontologist]] of the early 19th century. He was [[Georges Cuvier]], Director of the ''Muséum national d'histoire naturelle'' in [[Paris]]. Cuvier had shown that [[extinction]] of [[species]] had definitely taken place. His catastrophism was an [[explanation]] for the regular changes in [[species]] seen in the rock [[strata]]. He had no real explanation of why later species were different from earlier ones. He rejected the idea of [[evolution]], but did not propose a religious solution. 
 
 == The opposition ==  
 [[James Hutton]]'s ''Theory of the Earth'' (2 vols, 1795), followed lated by [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'' (3 vols, 1830–33), painted a quite different picture. 
 
 This was [[uniformitarianism]], also a word coined by Whewell. Hutton's basic idea was 'present-day processes also worked in the past'. The Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present, acting gradually over an immense period of time. 
 
 Lyell developed these ideas, and presented a huge number of observations which could only be explained by gradual action. His book strongly influenced the young [[Charles Darwin]], who took the first volume with him on the [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], and had the second volume sent ahead to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. 
 
 The [[age of the Earth]] is a factor in the debate. In the 19th century it was thought the Earth was perhaps 100 million years old. Now, we know it to be about 4,560 million years old. < ref > Dalrymple G. Brent 2004. ''Ancient Earth, ancient skies: the age of Earth and its cosmic surroundings''. Stanford.  < /ref >  That is definitely long enough for slow processes to take effect. 
 
 As a result, for a long period from 1840 to 1980, virtually all geologists were uniformitarians, believing 'the present is the key to the past'. 
 
 == Synthesis == 
 Finally, it became clear that both slow processes and rapid disasters have played a part in Earth history. < ref > Huggett, Richard 1997. ''Catastrophism: asteroids, comets, and other dynamic events in Earth history''. Verso, London. < /ref > 
 
 A major reason for this is the realisation that [[asteroid]] impacts, and some other events, have influenced Earth history. 
 
 === End of the dinosaurs === 
 Walter and Luis Alvarez suggested in 1980 that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] struck Earth 65 million years ago at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period.  
 
 The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving evidence of the [[K/T extinction event]]. In 1990, a {{convert|180|km|mi}} candidate crater marking the impact was identified at [[Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], [[Mexico]]. 
 
 The only debate now is whether the main extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact or widespread flood volcanism from the [[Deccan Traps]] (which occurred about the same time). Both mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature, though only the asteroid impact was sudden. 
 
 The observation of the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events do occur as natural events. 
 
 === Origin of the Moon === 
 The [[giant impact hypothesis]] is that the [[Moon]] was created out of the debris from a collision between the young [[Earth]] and a [[Mars]]-sized proto[[planet]]. This is the favoured scientific [[hypothesis]] for the formation of the Moon. < ref name=belbruno-2005 > {{cite journal | year=2005 | title=Where did the Moon come from? | journal=The Astronomical Journal | volume=129 | issue=3 | pages=1724–1745 | doi=10.1086/427539 | s2cid=12983980 | last1=Belbruno | first1=Edward | last2=Gott Iii | first2=J.
