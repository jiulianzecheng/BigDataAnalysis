 '''Saliva''' is the watery [[substance]] made in the [[mouth]]s of [[humans]] and many [[animal]]s.  Saliva begins [[digestion|digesting]] [[food]] in the mouth, and moistens [[food]] to make swallowing easier. Saliva consists of 99.5% water. 
 
 The mouth is obviously the point of entry to the whole [[alimentary canal]]. It follows from this that saliva must both help digestion, and protect against [[infection]]s. 
 
 The digestion part is by three [[enzymes]], one each for [[carbohydrates]], [[fats]] and [[proteins]]. The digestion started here carries on in the [[stomach]]. There are some other 'minor' enzymes as well, and we do not know the full story about them yet. Also there is a pain-killing opiorphin, and a wrap-around haptocorrin which keeps [[vitamin B12]] safe from stomach acids. Finally, there are a set of anti-bacterial proteins which make life difficult for any bacteria which get in with the food. < ref > Maton, Anthea 1993.. ''Human biology and health''.

 Saliva is filtered blood,  " These observations are consistent with the fact that saliva is a filtrate of blood, meaning that the contents of blood—water, salts and macromolecules—pass through capillary walls into the salivary glands.
