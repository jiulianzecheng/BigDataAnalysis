A '''month''' is an amount of [[time]] used with [[calendar]]s. It is about 1/12th of a year. It is a little longer than a natural synodic [[orbital period]] of the [[moon]], ca. 29.5 [[day]]s. [[Lunar calendar]]s use the natural synodic month. For some purposes astronomers use the sidereal month of 27.3 days. 
 
 Other calendars, called  " solar calendars " , ignore the moon, and depend entirely on the [[Sun]] â€” for example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] of 365 or 366 days (12 months) used in much of the world today.
