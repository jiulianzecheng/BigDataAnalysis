 '''Hellboy''' is a fictional [[superhero]] created by writer-artist [[Mike Mignola]]. The character first appeared in ''San Diego Comic-Con Comics'' #2 (August [[1993 in comics|1993]]), and has since appeared in various [[eponym]]ous [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and [[intercompany crossover]]s. The character has been adapted into three live-action feature movies. Two starring [[Ron Perlman]] in [[Hellboy (2004 film)|2004]] and [[Hellboy II: The Golden Army|2008]] in the title role, and one in [[Hellboy (2019 film)|2019]] which starred [[David Harbour]], as well as two [[Hellboy Animated|straight-to-DVD animated movies]], and three video games – ''[[Hellboy: Asylum Seeker|Asylum Seeker]]'', ''[[Hellboy: The Science of Evil|The Science of Evil]]'', and as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]''. 
 
 A well-meaning half-[[Demon]] (or [[Cambion]]) whose true name is '''Anung Un Rama''' ( " and upon his brow is set a crown of flame " ), Hellboy was summoned from [[Hell]] to [[Earth]] as a baby by [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultists]] (spawning his hatred for the [[Third Reich]]). He was discovered on a fictional [[Outer Hebrides]] Island by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.). In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned adult with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead), cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the  " Right Hand of Doom " ). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted [[peanut]]s. 
 
 Hellboy works for the B.P.R.D., an international non-governmental agency, and for himself against dark forces including [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[witches]], in a series of tales that have their roots in [[folklore]], [[pulp magazine]]s, vintage adventure, [[Lovecraftian horror]] and [[horror fiction]]. In earlier stories, he is identified as the  " World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator " . 
 
 In 2011, Hellboy was ranked 25th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes by [[IGN]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/25|title=Hellboy – #25 Top Comic Book Heroes|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2019-04-12|archive-date=2016-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124092921/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/25|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
