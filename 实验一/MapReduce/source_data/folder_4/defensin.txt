 A '''defensin''' is a small [[cation]] [[protein]] found in animals and plants. < ref > [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2008.08.019 Structureâ€“activity studies of AtPep1, a plant peptide signal involved in the innate immune response] Peptides Volume 29, Issue 12, December 2008, Pages 2083-2089 < /ref > < ref > [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12447532 Planta. 2002 Dec;216(2):193-202. Epub 2002 Oct 8. Plant defensins.] < /ref >  They are [[host defence peptide]]s. They work against [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]] and many [[viruses]].  
 
 Defensins have 18-45 [[amino acid]]s including six to eight conserved [[cysteine]] residues. < ref > " Conserved "  means the sequence stays the same in almost all individuals in the population. < /ref >  Cells of the [[immune system]] have these peptides to help kill [[Phagocyte|phagocytosed]] bacteria. Those cells include [[neutrophil]] [[granulocyte]]s and almost all [[epithelium|epithelial cells]]. Most defensins work by binding to the [[microbe|microbial]] [[cell membrane]]. Once there, they make tiny holes in the membrane which allow vital [[ions]] and [[nutrients]] to leak out.
