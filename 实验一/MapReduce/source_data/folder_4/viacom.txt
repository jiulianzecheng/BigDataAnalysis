 '''Viacom''' (short for '''Vi'''deo  &  '''A'''udio '''Com'''munications) was an American [[entertainment]] [[company]]. It started in [[1970]] as '''Viacom International''', the syndication division of [[CBS]] TV (which they once owned). In 2005, Viacom split into two companies: the original company was renamed [[CBS Corporation]], and a new company keeping the Viacom name was created. They own [[Paramount Pictures]], [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick Jr.]], and others. They formerly owned the movie rental giant [[Blockbuster Entertainment]]. 
 
 In 2019, Viacom and [[CBS Corporation|CBS]] were [[merger|merged]] together. This created [[ViacomCBS]], a combination of the two companies. The merger was finished on December 4, 2019. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-viacom-m-a-cbs/cbs-viacom-complete-merger-in-a-win-for-shari-redstone-idUSKBN1Y82ZF|title=CBS, Viacom complete merger in a win for Shari Redstone|date=December 4, 2019|last=Shivdas|first=Sanjana|website=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=February 11, 2020}} < /ref >  They have also launched a streaming service called CBS All Access, which includes their library of movies and TV shows, along with original content.
