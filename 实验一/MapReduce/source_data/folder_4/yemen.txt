 '''Yemen''', officially the '''Republic of Yemen''' is a nation in the [[Middle East]]. It is the old North Yemen and South Yemen, in the south of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It borders [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Oman]] on the north and the east. To the south is the [[Guardafui Channel]] and [[Gulf of Aden]], and to the west is the [[Red Sea]]. Yemen owns the island of [[Socotra]] (217 miles) to the south off the coast of East [[Africa]]. A person or thing from Yemen is called ''Yemeni''. Yemen's [[capital city]] is [[Sana'a]]. 
 
 Unlike other countries in Arabia Yemenis are mostly ethnically Jewish with small groups of various south Semitic peoples.{{cn}} In ancient times, Yemen was an important center of trade and power. Many powerful kingdoms were in Yemen, including the [[Sabaeans]]. Yemen was important in the trade of [[spice]]s as well. It was known to the [[Roman Empire|ancient Romans]] as ''Arabia Felix'' ( " Happy Arabia "  in [[Latin language|Latin]]). They called it Happy Arabia because the area was so beautiful and powerful. 
 
 In the 700s, Yemenis were among the first to join the new religion [[Islam]]. Since then, Yemenis have been staunch Muslims who were in the forefront of all Islam conquests. Men whose ancestors came from Yemen ruled [[Al-Andalus]] (Muslim Spain) for centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire]] took control of North Yemen, and the [[British Empire]] took South Yemen, in the early 20th century. The two parts were united in 1990 and later fought civil wars. The latest one started in 2015. Some famous people including former President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] were killed, and thousands died of hunger. 
 
 Today, Yemen has over 20 million people. Most of them speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 [[File:Yemen-map.png|thumb|left|180px|Map of Yemen|alt=Map of Yemen]] 
 Yemen is in [[Western Asia]]. It is on the southern half of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. A number of [[Red Sea]] islands, including the [[Hanish Islands]], [[Kamaran]], and [[Perim]], as well as [[Socotra]] in the [[Arabian Sea]], belong to Yemen. Many of the islands are [[volcano|volcanic]]. For example, [[Jabal al-Tair island|Jabal al-Tair]] had a volcanic eruption in 2007 and before that in 1883. The highest point in Yemen is [[Jabal an Nabi Shu'ayb]]. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 Yemen is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the [[Arab World]]. There is a 35% [[unemployment]] rate, which means  35 out of every 100 people in the labor force don't have a job. 
 
 == Government == 
 As a result of the [[2011–2012 Yemeni uprising]], the constitution of Yemen was rewritten. New [[Election|elections]] were to be held in 2014. Some areas are controlled by armed militant groups. On 23 January 2015, the President, Prime Minister and Cabinet resigned. War continued, with [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]] supporting different sides. 
 
 ===Governorates=== 
 As of February 2004, Yemen is divided into twenty [[governorates]] and one municipality called  " Amanat Al-Asemah " . < ref > [http://www.statoids.com/uye.html Governorates of Yemen]. < /ref >
