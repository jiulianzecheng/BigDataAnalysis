 The '''emu''' (''Dromaius novaehollandiae'') is a large [[flightless bird]]. It is native to [[Australia]]. The emu is the tallest bird from [[Australia]]. It is also the second tallest bird in the world, after its [[ratite]] relative, the [[ostrich]]. The emu is also related to the [[cassowary]] which is slightly smaller but heavier.  
 
 == Other emus ==  
 
 There were also two [[species]] of dwarf emu, ''Dromaius minor'', one living on King Island in Tasmania and the other on [[Kangaroo Island]]. They are examples of [[island dwarfism]]. The group on King Island became [[extinct]] in 1805, that on Kangaroo Island in 1827, and that in Tasmania in 1865. < ref name= " Blakers " > {{cite book|last=Blakers|first=M.|author2=S.J.J.F.

 == Description == 
 The soft-feathered, brown birds reach up to {{convert|1.9|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} in height. < ref name= " imp " > {{cite book|title=Discovering Wildlife - The Ultimate Fact File|publisher=International Masters Publishers BV MMV|date=2002|pages=21|language=English}} < /ref >  Their feathers are in a double layer which helps keep the emu cool. < ref name=imp/ >  They have bare skin on the sides of the face and their neck. They can weigh up to {{convert|55|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref name=imp/ >  They have two large legs, with three toes on each foot. Their wings are very short, about  
 {{convert|20|cm|in|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, and are hidden under their feathers. 
 
 They can live up to 10–20 years  
 The emu is common over most of mainland Australia. It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot. If necessary they can run at up to {{convert|50|km/h|mph|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} for some distance at a time. < ref name =  " Davies " > Davies, S. J. J. F. 1963. Emus. ''Australian Natural History'' 14:225–29 < /ref >  They may travel long distances to find food. One emu was found to have traveled {{convert|990|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref name=Blakers/ > 
 
 == Diet == 
 They feed on a variety of plants (seeds, flowers, new growth) and [[Insect|insects]]. 
 
 == Breeding == 
 [[File:Baby Emu.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Emu chick with striped feathers]] 
 Emus are solitary birds. However, the young chicks stay with the father until they are 18 months of age. The [[Seasonal breeder|breeding season]] is between February and July, when the female can lay between 5-15 eggs in a ground nest built by the male. < ref name=imp/ >  The male then sits on the eggs for 8 weeks until hatching. < ref name=imp/ >  The baby chicks have very clear stripes on the feathers which act as camouflage. < ref name=imp/ > 
 
 On the east coast of Australia, emus were once common but have become uncommon with increased human population. On the other hand, the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid (dry) regions. < ref name= " Emu fact sheet " > {{cite web |url=http://www.amonline.net.au/birds/factsheets/emu.htm |title= Emu fact sheet|accessdate=2008-07-27 |format= |work= Australian Museum Online}} < /ref >  Emus are farmed for their meat, [[Emu oil|oil]] and [[leather]]. The first emu farms began in [[Western Australia]] during the 1970s. < ref name= " DECC " > {{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/TheEmu.htm|title=Emu|date=September 2002|work=Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water|publisher=New South Wales Government|language=English|accessdate=2009-12-11|archive-date=2010-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530110959/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/TheEmu.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == The history of the name == 
 The first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in [[Arthur Phillip|Arthur Phillip's]] ''Voyage to Botany Bay'', published in 1789. < ref name =  " Gould " > Gould, J. 1865. ''Handbook to the Birds of Australia'' Volume 2. Reprinted in 1972 by Landsdowne Press < /ref >  The species was named by [[ornithology|ornithologist]] (bird expert) [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], who worked on Phillip's book. He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species. Its [[science|scientific]] name, Dromaius novaehollandiae, is from the [[Latin]] words, meaning  " fast-footed [[New Holland (Australia)|New Hollander]] " . The history of the [[common name]], ''emu'', is not certain, but is thought to have come from an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for large bird. This word was later used by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers to describe the related [[Cassowary]] in [[New Guinea]]. < ref name= " Emu fact sheet " / >  In Victoria, some [[Indigenous Australian]] words for the emu were ''Barrimal'' in the [[Djadja wurrung]] language, ''myoure'' in [[Gunai]], and ''courn'' in [[Jardwadjali]]. < ref name= " Wesson 2001 " > {{cite book | author = Wesson, Sue C. | year = 2001 | title = Aboriginal flora and fauna names of Victoria: As extracted from early surveyors' reports | location = Melbourne | publisher = Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages | url = http://www.vaclang.org.au/admin/file/content9/c7/ff.pdf | accessdate = 2006-11-11}} < /ref >
