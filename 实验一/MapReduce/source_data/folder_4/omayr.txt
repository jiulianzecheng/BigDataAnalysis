 == Biography == 
 Some sources suggest that Omayr's full name was Abdullah ibn Omayr ibn Wahab ibn Abu Wahab al-Kalbi ({{lang-ar|عَبْد ٱلله ٱبْن عُمَيْرٱبْن واہاب ٱبْن ٱلْكَلْبِيّ}}). < ref > {{Cite web|date=2013-11-04|title=The First Campaign|url=https://www.al-islam.org/maqtal-al-husayn-abd-al-razzaq-al-muqarram/first-campaign|access-date=2021-09-30|website=www.al-islam.org|language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Al-Tabari suggests that Omayr was from the Banu al-Alim tribe. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 According to Abu Makhnaf, when Kufis were preparing to fight [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], Omayr confronted them and asked them about their intentions. Kufis told that they would fight Husayn and Omayr then went to his wife Wahab bint Abd and informed her of his intention. It is reported that Umm Wahab said:  " God has guided you to a good path, do so and take me with you " . So he went out with his wife at night and joined Husayn. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 Omayr was inspired by [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn’s]] spiritual charisma and was reluctant to leave him despite of being aware about the consequences of staying with Husayn. In the Battle of Karbala, when Omayr asked for the permission for fighting, Husayn granted him permission believing him to be match for both the challengers. < ref name= " Al Muqarram1901912 " > {{cite book|title=Maqtal Al Husayn: Martyrdom Epic of Imam al Husain [as]|last=Al Muqarram|first=Abd al Razzaq|pages=190–191|chapter=The First Campaign}} < /ref > 
 
 Omayr stepped into the battlefield and the challengers asked his identity to which he introduced himself. However they could not recognize him and asked either Zuhayr ibn Qayn, Habib ibn Muzahir or Burayr to fight them. Yasir was standing nearby to whom Omayr said  " You son of the adulteress! Do you not wish to fight me?! " < ref name= " Al Muqarram1901912 "  / >  saying this he attacked Yasir and engaged him in a sword duel but at the same time Salim charged at him with his sword. Omayr while protecting himself lost fingers of his left hand and in retaliatory attack he killed Salim and Yasir.  After killing both of them he moved back to Husayn while reciting Martial poetry. < ref name= " Al Muqarram1901912 "  / >  Omayr's wife Umm Wahab witnessed Omayr's assassination. < ref name= " Al Muqarram1901912 "  / > 
 
 Omayr participated in the retaliatory attack when Al-Shimr attacked Al Husayn's right wing. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2013-11-04|title=The First Campaign|url=https://www.al-islam.org/maqtal-al-husayn-abd-al-razzaq-al-muqarram/first-campaign|access-date=2021-09-30|website=www.al-islam.org|language=en}} < /ref >  Omayr in that engagement killed 31 of them, of which 19 were horsemen and 12 were footmen. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  His right hand was severed by Hani ibn Thabit and left hand by Bakr ibn Hayy having left without arms, he was taken captive and according to some sources, was a put on a cross. < ref name= " Al Muqarram194 " > {{cite book|title=Maqtal Al Husayn: Martyrdom Epic of Imam al Husain [as]|last=Al Muqarram|first=Abd al Razzaq|page=194|chapter=The Left Wing}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|title=Al Manaqib|last=Ashub|first=Ibn Shahr|volume=02|page=217}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|title=Maqtal al Husayn|last=Al Athir|first=Ibn|volume=02|page=013}} < /ref >  Then, Omayr's head was cut off and thrown towards Husayn's camp. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  According to Al-Tabari, Omayr became the second martyr in the Battle of Karbala. < ref name= " :02 " > ''Al-Tabari, History of Nations and Kings'', 1387 AH, vol. 5, p. 436. < /ref >  After Omayr's head was thrown, his mother picked it up, took it and wiped her son's blood from it and then ran in the direction of the enemy forces.
