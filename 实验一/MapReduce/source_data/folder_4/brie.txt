[[File:Brie 02.jpg|thumb|A Brie]] 
 '''Brie''' is a type of [[soft cheese]] with a yellowish interior and a white layer (the  " rind " ) on the outside of the cheese.  
 
 The rind is eaten as well as the inside of this cheese. Like other [[cheese]]s, Brie is a [[dairy]] product made from [[cow]]s' [[milk]]. Brie cheese may be served with [[fruit]] as a [[dessert]] at the end of a meal, or with a [[relish]]. 
 
 The cheese is sometimes served slightly melted or baked, in a round, lidded ceramic dish, and topped with nuts or fruit, or both. 
 
 == How it is made == 
 Brie is a [[France|French]] cheese, and protected by [[AOC]] (''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]''). This means only this cheese from this region (near [[Paris]]) can properly call itself  " brie " . This is ignored by some countries outside Europe, but the system of AOC is used in the [[wine]] business, so many parts of the world do honour it, and have similar arrangements.

 The milk of soft cheeses (''à pate molle'' in French) is not heated during the production of the cheese. [[Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] said about this kind of cheese that it was the ''king of cheeses''. He said that in the [[19th century]]. This kind of cheese has been made for at least 1000 years. 
 
 In [[Europe]] this cheese is usually not treated chemically, so it might change in consistency or color. It will go bad if it is not kept cool. If that means it is kept in a [[refrigerator]], note that it should not be eaten that cold. It is best eaten when it is somewhat below normal [[room temperature]]. In most countries, brie-style cheeses are made with [[Pasteurization|Pasteurized]] milk. 
 
 Brie can be aged, that is, carefully treated for up to a year. Then it has a darker colour and a stronger [[taste]]. This is rarely seen outside of France.
