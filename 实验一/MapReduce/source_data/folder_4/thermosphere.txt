The '''thermosphere''' is the fourth layer of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is directly above the [[mesosphere]] (middle layer) and directly below the [[exosphere]] (top layer).  
 
 The name thermosphere is taken from the Greek word  " thermos "  which means 'heat'. This layer has high [[temperatures]] because it absorbs [[X-ray]] < nowiki/ > s and extreme [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the Sun. Even though it has temperatures of 2,000 °C (3,360 °F), the [[density]] of the thermosphere is so low that it doesn't feel hot. The absorbed [[ionizing radiation]] also creates the [[ionosphere]]. [[Shortwave radio]] waves can bounce off the [[Kennelly-Heaviside layer]] (ionosphere) and go to distant parts of the Earth. This layer is very helpful in radio communication.
