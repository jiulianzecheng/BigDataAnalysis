 The main A38 road goes through Bromsgrove. The M5 [[motorway]] passes by the west side of the town. The M42 motorway starts at the north of the town. 
 
 Bromsgrove [[train station]] is in the south of the town. The station is at the bottom of the  " Lickey Incline " .  The Lickey Incline is the steepest hill for trains in Britain. An extra [[locomotive]] has to help push heavy freight trains up the hill. There are many passenger trains to [[Birmingham]], [[Worcester]] and [[Hereford]]. There is a plan to build a new, better train station in Bromsgrove. The new station will cost about £10 million to £12 million. < ref > {{cite press release|url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Press-Releases/BROMSGROVE-TO-GET-NEW-STATION-bbb.aspx|title=Bromsgrove to get new station|publisher=[[Network Rail]]|date=2007-05-04|access-date=2010-10-21|archive-date=2012-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314070422/http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/Press-Releases/BROMSGROVE-TO-GET-NEW-STATION-bbb.aspx}} < /ref >
