 An '''angelshark''' is a [[species]] of [[cartilaginous fish]] in the [[genus]] '''''Squatina'''''. They have flattened bodies and wide [[pectoral fin]]s, which make them look similar to [[ray]]s. Twenty-three [[species]] are known.  
 
 The [[genus]] is the only one in its [[family (biology)|family]], Squatinidae, and [[Order (biology)|order]] Squatiniformes. They are worldwide in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[sea]]s.  Most species are in shallow temperate or tropical seas, but one species is found in deeper water, down to 1,300 metres.  < ref name=EoF > {{cite book |editor=Paxton J.R.  &  Eschmeyer W.N.|author= Stevens J.  &  Last P.R. |year=1998 |title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse/page/64 64]–65|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}} < /ref >  Angelsharks are specialised for a kind of [[predation]] which is unusual for sharks. 
 They are ambush predators. They have extensible [[jaw]]s with long, needle-like [[teeth]]. They quickly snap upwards to capture prey. They bury themselves in sand or mud lying in wait for their [[prey]], which includes [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, and many different types of [[mollusk]]s. < ref name=EoF/ >   
 
 == Discription and biology== 
 The front part of the angel sharks' bodies are wide and flattened, but the back part is more muscular. The eyes and [[spiracle]]s are on the top, and the five [[gill]] slits are on its back. Both the [[pectoral fin]]s and the [[pelvic fin]]s are large and are held horizontally. There are two [[dorsal fin]]s, no [[anal fin]]. Unusually for [[shark]]s, the lower lobe of the [[caudal fin]] is longer than the upper lobe. Most types of angel sharks grow to a length of about 1.5 metres: the [[Japanese angelshark]] reaches two metres. < ref > {{Cite web|title=FAMILY Details for Squatinidae-Angel sharks|url=http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/FamilySummary.php?Family=Squatinidae|work=fishbase.org|access-date=8 July 2013}}  < /ref >  They are [[ovoviviparous]], and can have up to 13 pups at a time. 
 
 ==Behavior== 
 Although angelsharks are bottom dwellers and appear harmless, they can give painful bites if provoked, due to their powerful [[jaw]]s and sharp [[teeth]]. Angelsharks may bite if a diver approaches the head or grabs the tail. < ref > Best, Cathleen.  " Florida Museum of Natural History. "  PACIFIC ANGEL SHARK.
