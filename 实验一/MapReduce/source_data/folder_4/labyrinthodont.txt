 '''Labyrinthodont''' is a term which was used for [[fossil]] [[amphibia]]. Although it is no longer a formal term in [[taxonomy]], it is still useful as an [[evolutionary grade]], a kind of catch-all term. ''Labyrinth'' mean a maze and ''dont'' means tooth. 
 
 Labyrinthodonts are often called [[Temnospondyl]]s. < ref > Milner, Andrew 1990. the radiations of temnospondyl amphibians. In Taylor P.D.  &  Larwood G.P. (eds) ''Major evolutionary radiations''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-857718-4}} < /ref > 
 The Labyrinthodontia is not a [[clade]], because it is not [[monophyletic]]. It has been replaced in the [[classification]] by more correct terms. 
 
 The labyrithodonts were some of the dominant animals from the [[Devonian]] to the Lower [[Triassic]] (about 390 to 210 million years ago). The group is an [[evolutionary grade]] (a [[polyphyletic]] or [[paraphyletic]] group) of species which look rather similar. 
 
 The name describes the [[pattern]] of infolding of the [[dentine]] and [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of the [[teeth]], which often fossilise. They are also have a heavily armoured [[skull]] roof (so they also have an even older name  " Stegocephalia " ), and complex [[vertebrae]].

 The labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. Although there was much variation, these [[Trait (biology)|traits]] make their fossils distinct and easy to recognise: 
 
 * '''Strongly folded tooth surface''', so that a cross section resembles a classical [[labyrinth]] (or [[maze]]). < ref name=Romer > Romer A.S.  &  Parsons T.S. 1985. ''The vertebrate body''. 6th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. < /ref > 
 * '''Massive skull roof''', with openings only for the nostrils, eyes and a [[parietal]] '[[third eye]]'. The skull was rather flat with thick dermal [[armour]], accounting for the older term for the group: ''Stegocephalia''. < ref name=Romer/ >  The [[amniote]]s ([[Sauropsid]]s and [[Synapsid]]s) developed deeper skulls. 
 * '''Otic notch''' behind each eye at the back edge of the skull. In the primitive waterbound forms it may have formed an open [[spiracle]], and may possibly have held an ear-drum in some advanced forms. < ref name=Clack > Clack, Jennifer A. 2007.

 * '''Complex [[vertebrae]]''' made of 4 pieces. 
 
 == What the term included == 
 * [[extinction|†]]'''Ichthyostegalia''' : term no longer used; see 'Fishapods', below. 
 * †'''[[Temnospondyli]]''' (possible ancestors of [[lissamphibia|modern amphibians]]) 
 * †'''[[Lepospondyli]]''' (possible ancestors of modern amphibians) 
 * †'''Reptiliomorpha''' (ancestors of [[reptiles]]): now referred to the [[Amniote]] stem-group or the Sauropsida. 
 
 === Specifically excluded === 
 * [[Lissamphibia]]ns: modern amphibia 
 * [[Amniote]]s: The terrestrial [[cleidoic egg]]-laying animals, the [[Sauropsida]] and [[Synapsida]]. 
 
 == Fishapods == 
 [[Image:Fishapods.svg|thumb|300px|In [[Devonian|Late Devonian]] [[vertebrate]] [[speciation]], descendants of [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] – like ''[[Eusthenopteron]]'' – had a series of [[adaptation]]s: < br/ > 
 {{*}}''[[Panderichthys]]'', suited to muddy shallows; < br/ > 
 {{*}}''[[Tiktaalik]]'' with limb-like fins that could take it onto land; < br/ > 
 {{*}}[[Tetrapod|Early tetrapods]] in weed-filled swamps, such as: < br/ > 
 & nbsp; & nbsp;{{*}}''[[Acanthostega]]'' which had feet with eight digits, < br/ > 
 & nbsp; & nbsp;{{*}}''[[Ichthyostega]]'' with limbs. < br/ > 
 Descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as [[coelacanth]] species.]] 
 
 Early tetropods are now classified as lobe-finned fish ([[Sarcopterygii]]). This is because we now know they were [[aquatic]] when the limbs first evolved (see [[Tetrapod]]). 
 
 The informal term ''fishapods'' is often used for this group of [[Devonian]] animals. 
 
 A more formal term, used by Clack, is  " stem-group tetrapods " . < ref name=Clack/ >
