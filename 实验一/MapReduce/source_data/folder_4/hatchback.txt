 A '''hatchback''' is a [[car]] body style with a rear door that swings upward to provide access to a cargo area. Indeed, this rear door that opens upwards is a distinguishing feature of all hatchbacks. Most hatchbacks use a two-box design body style, where the cargo area (trunk/boot) and passenger areas are a single unit. The rear seats can often be folded down to increase the available cargo area. The body style has been marketed worldwide on cars ranging in size from superminis to small family cars, as well as executive cars and some sports cars. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.clearvin.com/blog/car-body-styles/ |title=Car body styles
