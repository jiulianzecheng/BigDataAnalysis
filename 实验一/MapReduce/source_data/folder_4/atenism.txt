 '''Atenism''' was one of the earliest [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]]s. It was the worship of the light emanating from the sun god (or rather sun disk), [[Aten]]. It was started by the 18 dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep IV, better known as [[Akhenaten]]. It lasted 20 years, until Akhenaten's death. [[Tutankhamun]], Akhenaten's son, restored the [[Egyptian mythology|traditional Egyptian religion]]. Today modern day groups have attempted to revive Atenism as a worldwide religion, most notably [[Akhetaten Fellowship]].
