 [[Image:Hypercube.svg|250px|thumb|The [[tesseract]] is the best known polychoron, containing eight [[cube|cubic]] [[Cell (geometry)|cells]], three around each edge.It is viewed here as a [[Schlegel diagram]] projection into 3-space, distorting the regularity, but keeping its topological continuity. The eighth cell projects into the volume of space exterior to the boundary.]] 
 
 In [[geometry]], a '''polychoron''' (plural: '''polychora''') is a figure in four dimensions. The word comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''poly'', which means ''many'' and ''choros'' which means ''room'', or ''space''. Sometimes the figure is called '''4-[[polytope]]''' or '''polyhedroid'''. The analogue figure in two dimensions is a [[polygon]], and the one in three dimensions is a [[polyhedron]].
