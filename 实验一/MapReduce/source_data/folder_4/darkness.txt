 '''Darkness''' is when there is absence of  [[light]]. In practice, out in the open air, there is always almost some light, however slight. The darkness of the [[night sky]] is estimated by a nine-point scale known as the [[Bortle scale]]. 
 
 Darkness is made by blocking light from the [[sun]] or some other source of light, which makes [[shadow]]. At [[night]] the [[Earth]] blocks the sun, and casts a shadow over one entire side of the world. There is heat radiation even in the dark.  
 
 In [[myth]]ology, darkness is often [[Connection|connected]] with [[evil]]. Many people are uncomfortable or afraid when in the dark, especially [[children]]. 
 
 In [[religion]], darkness is considered as beginning of the world, before the light appeared.  At the same time, the darkness was  " the second to last plague "  ([[Exodus]] 10:21).  
 
 == Darkness in art == 
 Many artists used and still use darkness to fill the [[Negative space|void]] spaces on the [[canvas]]. Also it used for [[chiaroscuro]]. To create darkness, all colored [[Paint|paints]] are mixed. Every [[colour|color]] absorbs light frequencies.  {{wiktionary}}
