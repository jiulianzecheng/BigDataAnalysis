 '''Pienza''', a town  (it: ''commune'') in the [[province of Siena]], in the [[Val d'Orcia]] in [[Tuscany]] (central [[Italy]]), between the towns of [[Montepulciano]] and [[Montalcino]], is the  " touchstone of Renaissance urbanism. " < ref > Nicholas Adams,  " The Acquisition of Pienza 1459-1464 "  ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' '''44'''.2 (May 1985), pp. 99-110. Adams details the piecemeal acquisition of parcels of land by Pius II. < /ref > 
 
 In [[1996]], [[UNESCO]] put the town his list as a [[World Heritage Site]], and in [[2004]] the all [[valley]], the ''Val d'Orcia'', was put on the list of [[UNESCO]]'s World Cultural Landscapes. 
 
 == History == 
 Pienza was rebuilt from a village called '''Corsignano''', which was the birthplace (1405) of Aeneas Silvius [[Piccolomini]] (Italian: Enea Silvio Piccolomini), a [[Renaissance humanist]] born into an exiled Sienese family, who later became [[Pope Pius II]].  Once he became Pope, Piccolomini had the entire village rebuilt as an ideal [[Renaissance]] town.  Intended as a retreat from [[Rome]], it represents the first application of humanist [[urban planning]] concepts.The rebuilding was done by Florentine [[architect]] Bernardo Gambarelli (known as [[Bernardo Rossellino]]). 
 
 == Important Places and Monuments in Pienza == 
 === Palazzo Piccolomini === 
 The piazza is made by four buildings. The principal residence, ''Palazzo Piccolomini'', is on the west side. 
 === The Duomo === 
 The ''Duomo'' (Cathedral), which dominates the center of the piazza, has a façade that is one of the earliest designed in the [[Renaissance]] manner. [[Artworks]] in the Duomo include five altar paintings from the [[Sienese School]]. The Baptistry, dedicated as usual to ''[[John the Baptist|San Giovanni]]''. 
 === Palazzo Borgia === 
 The ''Palazzo Borgia'', on the third side of the piazza, was built as the palace to house the [[bishop]]s who would travel to Pienza to attend the [[Pope]]. Inside the palace there is the Diocesan Museum, and the Museo della Cattedrale.  The collection includes a lot of religious [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Paintings include a 7th-century painting of ''Christ on the Cross'' (''La Croce''), 14th century works by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]] (''Madonna with Child'') and [[Bartolo di Fredi]] (''Madonna della Misericordia'').  There are also important works from the 14th and 15th centuries, including a Madonna attributed to [[Luca Signorelli]]. 
 === Palazzo Comunale === 
 Across from the church is the town hall. Since Corsigniano was originally a village without a town governance, before the transformations there was no town hall. But when Corsigniano was given the status of an official city, a ''Palazzo Comunale'' was required. A third floor was added in [[1599]]. The ''Palazzo Comunale'' was probably also designed by [[Rossellino]]. 
 
 === Other buildings === 
 * ''Ammannati'' Palace 
 * The ''Gonzaga'' Palace 
 * The ''Palazzo del Cardinale Atrebatense'' 
 * The ''Pieve'' of Corsignano, in the neighbourhood, is one of the most important Romanesque monuments of the area.
