'''Matej''' is a [[given name]] that originates from the Slavic nations of Eastern Europe. It is one of the most common male names in both [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]]. It is also common in [[Croatia]] and [[Ukraine]] and less common in the [[Czech Republic]]. The name is originally derived from the evangelist disciple [[St. Matthew]]. Foreign versions of the name include Matthew in English, Math√§us in German, Matei in Romania and Matteo in Italian. Matej, being a Biblical name (see Acts 1:23) can be easily cross-referenced with the corresponding name in other languages. The Slavic pronunciation of the name consists of Matej with a soft  " j " . Matej in Ukraine and Russia is Matviy, and in [[Poland]] it is Maciej. The Hebrew version of the name is Mattithyahu or Matisyahu which translate to  " Gift of Yahweh "  in Standard Hebrew and Tiberian Hebrew. This is a unique name (not in the top 1000 newborn names in the US in 2021). < ref > {{Cite web|last=OACT|title=Popular Baby Names|url=https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/popularnames.cgi|access-date=2023-04-07|website=www.ssa.gov}} < /ref >
