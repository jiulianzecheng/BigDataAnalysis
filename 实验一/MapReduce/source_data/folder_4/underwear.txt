 '''Underwear''' are [[Clothing|clothes]] worn under other clothes, often next to the skin. They keep outer clothes from being made dirty by [[sweat]]. They also shape the body and provide support for parts of it, and in cold weather help the wearer to keep warm. Underwear can be used to protect the wearer's modesty, as well as to make them look sexy. Special types of underwear have [[Religion|religious]] importance. Some items of clothing are made to be worn as underwear, while others such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of [[shorts]] can be used both as underwear and as outer clothing. If made of suitable fabric, some types of underwear can serve as nightwear or [[swimsuit]]s. 
 
 Items of underwear commonly worn by women today include [[brassiere]]s (bras) and panties (also known as knickers), while men wear [[briefs]], trunks, [[boxer shorts]] or [[boxer briefs]]. Items worn by both women and men include T-shirts, sleeveless shirts, [[Bikini panty|bikini underwear]], thongs, T-fronts, and [[G-string]]s. In countries where the weather is cold, long underwear can be worn to keep warm. 
 
 ==Different words== 
 There are a number of different words for underwear: 'underclothes', 'underclothing', and 'undergarments' are more formal words. 
 
 === Female === 
 In casual situations, underwear may be called 'undies'. In Australia, one may hear underwear being called 'Reg Grundys' or 'Reginalds' (rhyming [[slang]] for 'undies'), while in the UK the word 'smalls' is sometimes used. Different types of women's undergarments are known together as 'lingerie' (pronounced '' < small > LAWN < /small > -zhur-ray''). They may also be called 'intimate clothing' or simply 'intimates'. 
 
 Words for the top half of female lingerie: 'bras', obviously. Note the use of 'teddy' for one-piece close-fitting nightwear. 
 
 Words for the bottom half of female lingerie: pants (US) versus knickers, drawers, or panties, but never pants! (UK). 'Briefs' is another possibility. 'French knickers' = knickers with frills, looser-fitting. Note the French ''cache-sex'' as a prototype 'G-string. Other types of undergarments are spandex shorts common for women who [[exercise]]. These shorts are used because it supports the behind and the back for good posture. 
 
 === Male === 
 An ''undershirt'' is an old word for a piece of underwear covering the [[torso]], which has fallen out of usage in the UK, but is still commonly used in [[North America]]. ''Vests'' is by far the most common term in the UK. ''[[:wikt:underpants|Underpants]]''  or ''[[:wikt:pants|pants]]'' cover the part of the body where the [[sex organ]]s are, but never ''[[:wikt:drawers|drawers]]''. Most common words: are ''shorts '' as in ''boxer shorts'' for the looser fit. ''Y-fronts'' for the tight fit (UK), ''boxers'' or ''briefs'' used for the same things in [[Canada]] and the USA. 
 
 These and other words for different types of underwear are set out in the table [[#Types and styles|below]]. The slang word for a man going without underwear is called ''free-balling''. The slang word for a bulge in a man's underwear is called ''mooseknuckle''. < ref > Morgan, Taralee.  " Lesbian lingo: slang terminology in English and Spanish spoken by lesbian communities in the United States. "  (2017). < /ref > 
 
 ==Function== 
 Underwear is worn for many reasons. They keep outer clothes from being made dirty by [[sweat]]. Men's [[briefs]] provide support for the [[male]] [[sex organ]]s, and women's [[brassiere]]s (bras) do the same thing for their [[breast]]s. Some people wear [[corset]]s to make their [[torso]]s a certain shape. For more support and protection when playing [[sports]], people often put on underwear that fits more tightly for extra support. Men may wear jockstraps and trunks (which are a type of [[boxer shorts]]). Women may wear sports bras and pelvic protectors. Sports bras lessen the chance of damage to the [[ligament]]s of the chest during vigorous exercises such as [[jogging]]. 
 
 In countries where the weather is cold, underwear is one more layer of clothing that helps the wearer to keep warm. Underwear can be used to keep the wearer modest â€“ for instance, some women wear camisoles and slips (petticoats) under clothes that are [[Transparent|see-through]]. A camisole is an item of clothing without [[sleeve]]s that covers the top part of a woman's body, while a slip or petticoat is a kind of [[skirt]] that is worn underneath an outer skirt. On the other hand, underwear can also be worn to make a person look more sexy. It is possible to buy underwear made specially to excite another person in a sexual way, such as underwear that can be eaten (it is usually made of small sweets stuck together) and underwear with holes cut into them. 
 
 Some items of clothing are designed to be worn as underwear, while others such as [[T-shirt]]s can be used both as underwear and as outer clothing. Whether underwear can be used as outer clothing depends on a number of things, such as how warm it is indoors and outdoors, what other people in society find acceptable, [[fashion]], and what the [[law]] allows. Some types of underwear can be used for sleeping in or as [[swimsuit]]s if they are made of suitable fabric. 
 
 ===Religious uses=== 
 Underwear can also have [[religion|religious]] use: 
 
 < !--Please arrange alphabetically.-- > 
 *'''Judaism'''. Some types of [[Judaism|Jews]] wear a [[prayer]] shawl (a piece of cloth wrapped around the [[shoulder]]s) called a ''tallit katan''. It has four corners which have ''tzitzit'' (fringes) attached to them. Because people who are not Jews do not usually walk about wearing prayer shawls, a Jewish person will often wear a ''tallit katan'' beneath a shirt so that it cannot be seen. However, as the shawl is not supposed to touch the skin, an undershirt is worn under it. < ref > {{cite web|title=About Tzizit|url=http://jewishbazaar.com/BAZAAR/TzizitInfo.HTM|publisher=JewishBazaar.com|access-date=2007-05-01|archive-date=2007-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225155/http://jewishbazaar.com/BAZAAR/TzizitInfo.HTM|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 *'''Mormonism'''. Most members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormonism|Mormons]]) wear special temple garments under their clothes after they have gone through special [[ritual]]s in a [[temple]]. They believe that such clothes help them remember the teachings of the temple (sacred covenants), foster modesty, and also shield and protect the wearer. < ref > {{cite web|title=Preparing to enter the Holy Temple|url=http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=cf755f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD & locale=0 & sourceId=9903cb7a29c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____ & hideNav=1|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|access-date=2008-04-02}} < /ref > 
 *'''Sikhism'''. [[Sikhism|Sikh]] men and women believe that they should wear the ''panj kakaar'' (five articles of faith) to help them remember their faith. One of the articles is a type of underpants called the ''kacchera'', which are similar to [[boxer shorts]].

 ==Fashions and trends== 
 ===Designers and retailers=== 
 A number of big clothes designers are well known for their underwear collections. Two of these are Calvin Klein and Dolce  &  Gabbana. There are also companies that make only underwear, such as 2(x)ist, Agent Provocateur, C-IN2, GapBody, Gilly Hicks, Ginch Gonch, La Senza, [[Hanes]], [[Fruit of the Loom]], Lord, and Victoria's Secret. < ref > [https://sewguide.com/types-of-underwear/] 40 Different types of Underwear < /ref > 
 
 ===Exposed underwear=== 
 Although most of the time underwear is kept hidden under other clothes, sometimes it is partly exposed for fashion reasons or to make other people feel sexually excited when they see it. A woman may, for instance, allow the top of her bra to peek out from under her [[collar]], or wear a see-through [[blouse]] over it. Some men wear T-shirts underneath partly- or fully-unbuttoned [[shirt]]s. 
 
 A common style among young men is to allow their trousers to sag or droop down below their waists. This fashion is called  " sagging " . When a person allows his trousers to sag, the waistband or a larger part of his underpants can be seen. A woman wearing trousers which expose the upper back portion of her thong underwear is said to show a  " whale tail " . 
 
 ===Not wearing underpants=== 
 {{main|Going commando}} 
 Not wearing underpants under one's outer clothing is known in American [[slang]] as  " freeballing "  for men or  " freebuffing "  for women.
