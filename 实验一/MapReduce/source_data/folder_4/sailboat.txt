 A '''sailboat''', '''sailing boat''' or '''yacht'''  is a boat that has a [[mast]] and [[sail]]s. It moves by using the wind in its sails but it may also have an engine. < ref >  Sleight, Steve (2017). The Complete Sailing Manual. London: Penguin. p. 70. < /ref > 
 
 ==Types== 
 There are a great many different sailboats.  
 
 ===Dinghy=== 
 A [[dinghy sailing|sailing dinghy]] is a small boat up to about 7 metres (23 ft.) which usually has a [[centreboard]]. It does not have a cabin. Usually, a sailboat has two sails: a [[mainsail]] and a [[jib]] and sometimes a [[spinnaker]]. 
 
 ===Sailing yacht=== 
 A sailing [[yacht]] is a larger boat with a [[boat keel|keel]] and it normally has a cabin. These types of boats can sail long distances, sometimes even around the world. Sometimes they have only one mast but they can have two or three. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.rya.org.uk/startboating/Pages/Yacht.aspx|title=Start boating: Yacht|publisher=RYA|accessdate=2010-10-28|archive-date=2015-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703101520/http://www.rya.org.uk/startboating/Pages/Yacht.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Tall ship=== 
 A tall ship is an even larger [[sailing ship|sailing boat]] which were used before [[steam engine]]s were invented. These were used for carrying [[cargo]] from [[port]] to port in days gone by. Now they are usually used as training ships for young people. A tall ship usually has more than one mast. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4232/pg4232.html|title=A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers|first=Thoreau, Henry David|last=1817-1862|date=|website=www.gutenberg.org|accessdate=9 May 2018}} < /ref >
