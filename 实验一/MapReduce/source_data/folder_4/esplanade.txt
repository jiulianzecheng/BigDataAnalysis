 An '''esplanade''' is a long, open, level area.  It is usually next to a river or large body of water for people to walk on. This allows people to promenade along the sea, usually for [[recreation]]al purposes. They can ignore the state of the tide and do not have to walk on the [[beach]]. Esplanades became popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian time]]s when it was [[fashion]]able to visit [[seaside resort]]s.
