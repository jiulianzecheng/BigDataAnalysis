 '''Diverticulitis''' is a [[disease]] of the [[digestive system]]. It is caused by [[inflammation]] of pouches (diverticula) in the walls of the [[bowel]]. It usually occurs in the [[large intestine]]. Diverticula can also be in the upper digestive tract at the level of the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]] and [[small intestine]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.passeportsante.net/fr/Maux/Problemes/Fiche.aspx?doc=diverticulite-diverticulose-diverticules-mal-de-ventre_pm|title= Diverticulite|date= 3 January 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Symptoms== 
 Symptoms of diverticulitis depend on the extent of inflammation in the [[intestine]]. Diverticulitis can be very painful. The pain is usually present in the lower abdomen on the left side. People with diverticulitis can also have nausea, vomiting, difficulty or pain while passing urine and changes in bowel habits. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://sante.canoe.ca/condition_info_details.asp?channel_id=0 & relation_id=0 & disease_id=155 & page_no=1#Symptoms|title=Diverticulite : Symptômes et complications}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Complications== 
 One of the complications of diverticulitis can be the formation of an abscess in the abdominal cavity. The [[inflammation]] or [[infection]] can then reach the abdominal wall and causes peritonitis. This infection can also spread to other parts of the body such as organs near the intestine, causing [[sepsis]], which is dangerous. In addition, a fistula may form between the intestine and other organs. Diverticulitis may also cause a blockage in the [[colon]]. < ref name= " C.Smeltzer 2006 " > C.Smeltzer, Suzanne et G.Bare, Brenda ''Médecine et chirurgie : Fonction digestive,métabolique et endocrinienne''. édition ERPI, Saint-Laurent, 2006, p.1389. < /ref > 
 
 ==Prevention== 
 To prevent diverticulitis, it is important to be active and to have a diet rich in fibers. These include eating ([[fruits]], [[vegetables]], [[legumes]] and [[cereals]]). It is also possible to reduce the risks of diverticulitis in several ways: chew foods before swallowing, [[defecation|defecate]] as soon as you feel the need, eat less fats and meats, do more physical activities, eat probiotics and drink water regularly. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.passeportsante.net/fr/Maux/Problemes/Fiche.aspx?doc=diverticulite-diverticulose-diverticules-mal-de-ventre-pm-prevention-de-la-diverticulite|title= Prévention de la diverticulite|date= 3 January 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Diagnosis== 
 To diagnose diverticulitis, it is important to do a barium enema X-ray to see the shape of the intestine wall. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://sante.canoe.ca/condition_info_details.asp?channel_id=0 & relation_id=0 & disease_id=155 & page_no=1#Symptoms|title=Maladies : Diverticulite}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >   Diverticula can be seen with a axial tomographie scan (CT scan). It is also possible to prescribe an abdominal radiograph to indicate if there is a perforation. After the acute phase or absence of acute diverticulitis, the doctor can prescribe a colonoscopy to look at the colon and determine the evolution of the [[disease]]. < ref name= " C.Smeltzer 2006 " / > 
 
 ==Surgery== 
 The resection of the colon is the procedure most often used to treat severe diverticulitis. It is also possible to do a resection of the diseased part of the [[colon]] and make a colostomy. In fact, if a diverticulitis is too large, a colostomy could be necessary either temporarily or permanently. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.passeportsante.net/fr/Maux/Problemes/Fiche.aspx?doc=diverticulite-diverticulose-diverticules-mal-de-ventre-pm-traitements-medicaux-de-la-diverticulite|title= Traitement médicaux de la diverticulite|date= 3 January 2013}} < /ref >
