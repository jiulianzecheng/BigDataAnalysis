 A '''snowman''' is a [[statue]] of a [[person]] made of [[snow]]. Snowmen are usually made when people make three [[Sphere|balls]] of snow that are different sizes.(In Japan, snowmen are made by two snowballs) They will stack the balls on top of each other to make a snowman, and stick some things in it to make it look more like a person like a scarf, pebbles, buttons and a carrot (for the nose).  
 
 The biggest snowman in the [[United States|US]] was built on February 26, 2008, which was 122 feet and 1 inch long. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-snowman?fb_comment_id=982847385149712_986137434820707|title=Record Page|website=Guinness World Records|access-date=April 23, 2020}} < /ref >
