 '''Fern'''s are a group of about 20,000 [[species]] of [[plant]]s. About 10,000 are living: they are in the [[Division (botany)|division]] '''Pteridophyta'''. < ref > Also known as ''Filicophyta'' < /ref >   
 
 Unlike [[bryophyte]]s, ferns have [[xylem]] and [[phloem]], which makes them [[vascular plant]]s. Unlike [[seed plants]] like [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants) or [[gymnosperms]], ferns do not have [[seed]]s. Instead, they reproduce by releasing their [[spore]]s into the environment where the germinate into a  [[Prothallus]]. 
 
 Most ferns belong to the [[Class (biology)|Class]] Leptosporangiata (or Pteridopsida). This includes most of those you see in gardens and woods. The [[horsetail]]s belong to another class, the Equisetopsida, which was extremely important in the [[Carboniferous]] period. < ref > Taylor, Thomas N.  &  Edith L. Taylor. 1993. ''The biology and evolution of fossil plants. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. pp. 303–305. {{ISBN|0-13-651589-4}}. < /ref >  Only one [[genus]] survives. The other classes of fern are also quite small today. 
 
 Ferns do not have waxes or special cells on their surface that keep water from [[evaporate|evaporating]]. This means that they best live in a place where there is a lot of [[fog]] or has a lot of [[rainfall]] and is in a [[shade]] that protects them from direct [[sunlight]]. Most do have [[root]]s, [[Plant stem|stems]], and [[leaf|leaves]]. Their stems may form [[Runner (botany)|runner]]s, called [[stolon]]s above the ground, or [[rhizome]]s below ground. The leaves are green and large, and may have spores on the underside. Some ferns grow large in moist places. They can survive in more places than [[moss]]es, but not as much as [[Seed plants|seed plant]]s. 
 
 During the [[Carboniferous]] period – from 350 million years ago – ferns lived everywhere on land. These ferns, called [[tree fern]]s grew up to 30 metres. There were huge [[forest]]s of ferns and [[moss]]es, giant [[horsetail]]s, full of giant [[insect]]s, etc. Today, there are no large forests of tree ferns and tree ferns are not so large.
