[[File:La Rendición de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Capitulation of Granada'' by F. Pradilla y Ortiz, 1882: Muhammad XII surrenders to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]].]]  
 The '''Nasrid dynasty''' or '''Banuu Nasri''' ({{lang-ar|بنو نصر}}) was the last [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] dynasty in [[Spain]]. The Nasrid dynasty came to power after the defeat of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in 1212 at the Battle of Las Navas de [[Tolosa]]. Twenty-three different [[emir]]s ruled [[Granada]] from the founding of the dynasty in 1232 by Muhammed I ibn Nasr until January 2, 1492, when Muhammad XII of Granada surrendered to the Christian Spanish kingdoms of [[Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Today, the most visible evidence of the Nasrids is the [[Alhambra]] palace built under their rule.
