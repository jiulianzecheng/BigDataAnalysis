The '''''Magi''''' were  " wise men from the east "  who came to [[Jerusalem]] during the reign of [[Herod the Great|Herod]]:  'saying, Where is he that is born King of the [[Jew]]s?' ( [[Gospel of Matthew]] chapter 2 verse 1) Their visit to [[Jesus]], guided by the [[Star of Bethlehem]] is celebrated every year at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] on [[January 6]], just after [[Christmas]]. 
 The Epiphany marks the end of the liturgical season 'Christmas'. 
 
 India is east of Israel, and some say that the Magi could have come from India. At the time of Jesus there were many spiritual seekers there. In India, Christian celebrations of Christmas sometimes include the arrival of the Magi on camels. An [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] tradition says the  " Magi of Bethlehem "  were Balthasar of Arabia, Melchior of Persia, and Caspar of India. < ref > {{cite book |first1=Vrej |last1=Nersessian |year=2001 |title=The Bible in the Armenian Tradition |publisher=Getty |isbn=978-0-89236-640-8}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}} < /ref >
