 '''Hue''' is one of the main properties of a [[color]].  
 
 It is defined as “the degree to which a [[stimulus]] is similar to, or different from, stimuli that are red, green, blue, and yellow” (the unique hues).  
 
 The other main aspects of color appearance are [[colorful]]ness, [[chroma]], [[Saturation (color)|saturation]], [[light]]ness, and [[brightness]]. 
 
 Usually, colors with the same hue are distinguished with adjectives referring to their lightness and/or chroma, such as with  " light blue " ,  " pastel blue " ,  " vivid blue " .
