 A '''pension''' is a steady [[income]] given to someone. If pensions are part of a system of [[social security]], the recipient of the pension is usually [[retirement|retired]] or [[disabled]]. They either have worked a long time during their life, or they are physically unable to do so. A pension is usually paid until a certain date (or event) occurs. In the case of social security plans, pensions are usually linked to the life of the person who receives the pension.  
 
 A '''defined Benefit''' pension defines the benefit to the worker based on [[salary]] basis, years worked, and a multiplier.  An example might be 2@55 final 3, meaning that the annuity is the highest 3-year average salary times years worked times 2% (if age 55).  A worker with 30 years service would receive 2*30 or 60% of their salary.  Some systems allow a worker to receive more than 100% salary by various maneuvers to alter the final salary basis. 
 
 A '''defined Contribution''' pension defines the contribution, without constraining or promising a certain benefit.  For example, a company might contribute 10% of a worker's salary to a pension account of the worker's choice, with final benefit received linked to the performance of the investment chosen.   
 
 == Crisis == 
 Many pension systems are underfunded and likely unsustainable based on independent financial analysis.  Pension reform is a popular topic since about [[2009]], with pension [[debt]] seen as a contributing factor in the [[Economic deficit|deficits]] at all levels of government.
