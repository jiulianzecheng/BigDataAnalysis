 A '''spokesman''' ('''spokesperson''' or '''spokeswoman'''), or '''spokesmodel''' is a person who speaks on behalf of others, but is understood not to be necessarily part of the others (e.g. hired to represent the others). < ref name= " isbn0-7914-3762-0 " > {{cite book |author=Goodman, Michael B. |title=Corporate communications for executives |url=https://archive.org/details/corporatecommuni0000good |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1998 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/corporatecommuni0000good/page/13 13] |isbn=0-7914-3762-0 }} < /ref >   
 
 A spokesperson's job is to faithfully (with good intentions) represent and promote for how the organization will run, even if he/she doesn't agree with the organization's opinions. Because of this, spokespeople are normally people who are highly experienced employees, or people who have been supporting the organization's goals for a long time. < ref name= " isbn0-7914-3762-0 "  / >
