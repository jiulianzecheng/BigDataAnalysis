An '''intron''' is a non-coding sequence in a [[gene]]. 
 
 It is any [[nucleotide]] sequence within a [[gene]] that is removed by [[RNA splicing]] to get the final RNA product of a gene. < ref name= " Alberts " > {{cite book |author=Alberts, Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8153-4105-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} < /ref > < ref name= " Stryer " > {{cite book |author=Stryer, Lubert; Berg, Jeremy Mark; Tymoczko, John L. |title=Biochemistry |publisher=W.H.

 [[File:Pre-mRNA to mRNA.svg|center|thumb|420px|A [[spliceosome]] removes introns from a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] pre-[[mRNA]] segment (top). This is called 'splicing'. After the introns have been removed (bottom), the mature mRNA sequence is ready for [[Translation (genetics)|translation]].]] 
 
 Sequences of coding DNA which are joined together in the final RNA after RNA splicing are '''exon'''s. They code for [[amino acid]]s in the final [[polypeptide]]. 
 
 Introns are in the genes of most organisms and many viruses. They can be in a wide range of genes, including those that generate [[protein]]s, [[Ribosome|ribosomal]] RNA (rRNA), and [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA). RNA splicing takes place after [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and before [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]. 
 
 *Introns: parts of a gene which are discarded: non-working bits. 
 *Exons: parts of a gene which are expressed: bits of a gene which code for [[amino-acid]] sequences in a [[protein]]. 
 
 The discovery of introns led to the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1993 for [[Phillip Sharp]] and  [[Richard Roberts]]. The term ''intron'' was introduced by American [[biochemist]] [[Walter Gilbert]]. < ref > {{cite journal

 == Biological meaning == 
 There are many unanswered questions about introns. It is unclear whether introns serve some specific function, or whether they are [[selfish DNA]] which reproduces itself as a [[parasite]]. < ref > Orgel L.E.  &  Crick, F.H.C. 1980. Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite. ''Nature'', '''284''', 604-607. < /ref > 
 
 Recent studies of entire [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[genome]]s have now shown that the lengths and density (introns/gene) of introns varies considerably between related [[species]]. There are four or five different kinds of intron. Some introns represent [[mobile genetic element]]s ([[transposon]]s). 
 
 [[Alternative splicing]] of introns within a gene allows a variety of protein [[isoform]]s from a single gene. Thus multiple related proteins can be generated from a single gene and a single precursor mRNA transcript. The control of alternative RNA splicing is performed by complex network of signalling molecules. In humans, ~95% of genes with more than one exon are alternatively spliced. < ref > Pan, Q; Shai O, Lee LJ, Frey BJ, Blencowe BJ 2008.
