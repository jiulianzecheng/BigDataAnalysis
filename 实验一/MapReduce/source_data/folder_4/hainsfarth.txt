 '''Hainsfarth''' is a [[municipality]] in the district of [[Donau-Ries]] in [[Bavaria]] in [[Germany]]. The mayor is currently Ursula Seefried. 
 
 Hainsfarth is home to a large Jewish population, which made up 40% of the people living there in 1810. Since 1710 it has had a [[synagogue]]. This was destroyed by the [[Nazis]] in 1938, but it was rebuilt in 1996. < ref name= " Hains " > [http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/hainsfarth_synagoge.htm Hainsfarth (Landkreis Donau-Ries) - Jüdische Geschichte / Synagoge] {{in lang|de}} Alemannia Judaica, accessed: 10 July 2017 < /ref >  The village also has a [[Jewish cemetery]], which was ruined by the Nazis. This was also restored.
