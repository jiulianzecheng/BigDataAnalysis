'''Georgism''' is a way of thinking about economics and land use. It is based on the ideas of [[Henry George]], an American economist and social philosopher. Georgists believe that people should have equal access to the benefits of land, which is a natural resource. They argue that the value of land comes from the community, and that this value should be shared equally among all members of society. 
 
 Georgism proposes a system of taxation that is based on the value of land. This is called a  " [[land value tax]] "  or  " single tax " . The idea is that people should pay a tax on the value of the land they own, but not on any improvements they make to the land. This would discourage land speculation and encourage the efficient use of land. Georgists believe that this would also promote social justice, by reducing inequality and poverty. 
 
 Georgism has been influential in many areas of economics and social policy. It has been used to support environmental conservation, urban planning, and social welfare programs. Georgists have also been involved in political movements, such as the Progressive movement in the United States and the Social Credit movement in Canada. 
 
 Critics of Georgism argue that it would be difficult to implement in practice, and that it could lead to unintended consequences, such as a reduction in the supply of land for productive use. They also question the idea that the value of land is created solely by the community, and suggest that individuals also play a role in creating value. 
 
 Despite its critics, Georgism remains an important idea in economics and social policy. It continues to be studied and debated by scholars and policymakers around the world, as they search for ways to create a more just and equitable society.
