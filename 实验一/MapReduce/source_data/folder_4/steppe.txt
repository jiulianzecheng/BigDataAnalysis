 In physical [[geography]], a '''steppe''' is a [[plain]] without [[tree]]s (apart from those near rivers and lakes). It is similar to a short-grass [[prairie]], although a prairie is generally considered as North America, and the steppe is in eastern Europe and central Asia. Sometimes the short-grass prairie in North America is also called a steppe. Similar places in Africa are called [[savanna]]. The world's largest steppe, sometimes called The Great Steppe, is in Russia. < ref > {{cite web|title=steppe in Learner's Dictionary|url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/steppe|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=8 April 2013|archive-date=25 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325170425/http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/steppe|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The Mongolian Steppe, also known as the Eastern Steppe, is located in northern [[Mongolia]]. It is between the [[Altai Mountains]] in the west and the Greater Khingan Region in the east. 
 
 ==Climate and Landscape== 
 It may be semi-[[desert]], or covered with [[grass]] or [[shrub]]s or both, depending on the [[season]] and [[latitude]]. It is the sort of [[climate]] that is in regions too dry for a [[forest]], but not so dry that there are only deserts. The [[soil]] is too moist for a desert, but too dry for normal forest life. Steppes receive slightly more rain than deserts do. The climates in steppes are usually temperate. They are pretty dry because there is very minimal rain. < ref name=NatGeo > {{cite web|title=Definition of Steppe|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/steppe/?ar_a=1|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=8 April 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Culture== 
 This is an open area, and often there were long distances between places with good water. People who lived in this type of area were often [[nomad]]s, often traveling by [[horse]]s. [[Genghis Khan]] was a great warrior from [[Mongolia]] who lived on the steppe. < ref name=NatGeo / >  The majority of people in the steppe are nomads. Families in Mongolia live in  " gers "  which is a large portable tent. Mongolians are also master horse riders so many families own many horses that roam the steppe. The people in the steppe interact with the steppe with using the animals there for there food and drink. They also have a very prominent musical culture with a wide variety of traditional Mongolian songs. 
 
 In the [[United States]], the [[cowboy]] herded cattle in the steppe, moving from place to place by horse. During the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s in [[North America]], farmers who had recently settled on the land and started farms suddenly found themselves without food. Many of them left. Eventually they learned to plow differently and plant crops that survived a [[drought]] better, and to plant trees in rows called [[windbreak]]s.
