 '''Entomophagy''' is a term of [[Ancient Greek]] origins, and means using [[insect]]s as a source of [[food]]. It can be found in insects that eat other insects, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s and [[mammal]]s. Non-human animals that feed on insects are known as [[insectivore]]s.  
 
 The term also describes human insect-eating, which can be found in parts of North, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand. Insect-eating is uncommon, or even [[taboo]] in some societies. < ref name= " Weiss & Mann " > {{cite book|title= Human Biology and Behaviour: An Anthropological Perspective.| year=1985 | publisher=Little Brown  &  Co. | location = Boston |isbn=0-673-39013-6 | author= Weiss, M.L.,  &  Mann, A.E.}} < /ref > < ref name= " McElroy & Townsend " > {{cite book|title= Medical Anthropology in Ecological Perspective.| year=1989 | publisher=Westview Press | location = Boulder, Colorado|isbn=0-8133-0742-2 | author= McElroy, A.,  &  Townsend, P.K.}} < /ref > < ref name= " Saggers & Gray " > {{cite book|title= Aboriginal Health  &  Society: The Traditional and Contemporary Aboriginal Struggle for Better Health.| year=1991 | publisher=Allen  &  Unwin | location = Sydney |isbn=1-86373-057-5 | author= Saggers, S.,  &  Gray, D.}} < /ref > < ref name=Gordon > {{cite book | last = Gordon| first = David George| title = The Eat-A-Bug Cookbook | url = https://archive.org/details/eatabugcookbook0000gord| year = 1998 | publisher = Ten Speed Press | location = Berkely, California |isbn=0-898-159-776}} < /ref >
