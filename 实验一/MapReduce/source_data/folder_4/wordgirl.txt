'''''WordGirl''''' is an American children's flash animated superhero television series produced by the Soup2Nuts animation unit of Scholastic Entertainment for [[PBS Kids]]. The series began as a series of shorts entitled The Amazing Colossal Adventures of WordGirl that premiered on [[PBS Kids]] and [[PBS Kids Go!]] on November 10, 2006, usually shown at the end of [[Maya  &  Miguel]] the segment was then spun off into a new thirty-minute episodic series that premiered on September 3, 2007 on most [[PBS]] member stations. The series of shorts consisted of thirty episodes, with 130 episodes in the full half-hour series. 
 
 WordGirl creator Dorothea Gillim felt that most children's animation  " underestimated [children's] sense of humor "  and hoped to create a more intellectual show for young audiences. 
 
 By June 2014, many PBS stations had stopped airing WordGirl, opting to air more popular series throughout the summer. However, new episodes continued to air on select stations, with streaming options on the PBS Kids website and video app. The series ended on August 7, 2015, with the episode  " Rhyme  &  Reason " .
