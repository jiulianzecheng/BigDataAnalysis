'''Hardness''' is a measure of how much a material resists changes in shape.  Hard things resist pressure. Some examples of hard materials are [[diamond]], [[boron carbide]], [[quartz]], tempered [[steel]], [[ice]], [[granite]], [[concrete]].  Ability of material to resist wear, tear, scratching, abrasion cutting is called hardness.     
 
 Harder materials are more difficult to cut and shape than softer ones. They are also usually more [[wikt:brittle|brittle]] which means they do not bend much but can shatter. Hard materials are used in cutting tools, machines and construction materials and other industrial goods.  
 
 Hardness tests are important in [[materials science]].  The [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]] tests the hardness of [[mineral]]s. The [[Brinell scale]] and various compression tests and rebound tests are more used for metals and artificial materials.
