A '''fact''' is a statement that is [[real]] or [[true]], or a thing that can be ''shown'' to be real or true. That is its core meaning, though the word has a long history, and has been used in many ways. < ref > Shorter OED, p667. < /ref >   
 
 A fact is something that has really happened or is actually the case. The usual test for a statement of fact is whether it can be shown to be true. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Scientific]] facts are verified by careful [[observation]] or [[measurement]] (by [[experiments]] or other means). 
 
 == Facts as statements == 
 A fact is a [[statement]] (a claim) about something that is true. A fact can answer questions like,  " what color is it? "  or  " who made that? " 
 
 An [[opinion]] is different from a fact. But you can say facts about a person's opinion. For example, someone can ask a question like  " What is Alice's opinion about the book? "  You can answer this question with a fact, for example  " Alice said she likes the book. "  Then it is a fact that Alice ''says'' she likes the book. But maybe Alice does not like the book. So it is not a fact that Alice likes the book, but it is a fact that Alice ''says'' she likes the book. 
 
 One way to learn a fact is if a person can help you see it. For example, if you ask,  " do you have my book? "  To answer this question, a person can let you see your book. Then you can know it is a fact that this person has your book.

 * [[Water]] always comes from the [[sky]]. 
 * [[Dogs]] are made of [[cheese]]. 
 * All people read [[books]]. 
 * [[Cows]] live under water. 
 
 == Scientific theories == 
 {{main|Theory|Scientific theory}} 
 
 A scientific theory is [[knowledge]] of important facts about a natural thing. The facts in a scientific theory have [[evidence]] that shows that the fact is not false.  
 
 A person who understands the [[scientific method]] can test to see if the facts of a scientific theory are correct. When statements have been tested and shown to be not false, they  < u > may < /u >  be  " true " . The facts of each scientific theory have usually been questioned and tested by many people. Because of this, we know that the knowledge of a scientific theory is fact and not opinion. Examples of scientific theories include the [[theory of relativity]] and the [[theory of evolution]]. More simply, it is a fact that the [[Earth]] goes around the [[Sun]] (and not vice versa). This took so long to establish because a leading religious body had the reverse opinion (see articles on [[Galileo]] and [[Copernicus]] for the story). Now we can say that there is a difference between statements of fact, and opinions or claimed truths of religion. ''The difference is in the way disputes about the truth are decided''.
