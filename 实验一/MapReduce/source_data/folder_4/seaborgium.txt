 '''Seaborgium''' is a [[chemical element]]. In the past, it has been named '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-tungsten''' but is now named seaborgium. It has the symbol '''Sg''' and it has the [[atomic number]] 106.  Seaborgium is a [[radioactive]] element that does not exist in nature. It has to be made. The most stable [[isotope]] is  < sup > 271 < /sup > Sg. Seaborgium-271 has a [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of 2.4 [[minute]]s.  
 
 What Seaborgium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight, but since it is in the same period as tungsten in the periodic table, its appearance and may be similar to it.

 The element is named in honor of [[Glenn Seaborg]]. 
 
 Seaborgium is a [[transuranium element]]. This means that it is  " beyond "  (trans) the element [[Uranium]] in the sequence of elements. 
 
 [[Mendeleev]] predicted that Seaborgium would exist. He called the element '''eka-tungsten''' because of its location was near [[Tungsten]] in the [[Periodic Table]]. The chemistry of seaborgium is like the chemistry of [[tungsten]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Seaborgium has no uses at all because of how fast it destroys itself.  
 
 == Chemistry == 
 Seaborgium Carbonyl (CO)‚Å∂ was made using the same method as Tungsten. Its only known and studied as a gas.
