 The '''Senedd''' ({{lang-en|Senate}}), previously called the '''[[National Assembly for Wales|National Assembly]] building''', < ref name= " Groundbreaking " > {{cite web | url= http://new.wales.gov.uk/news/archivepress/localgovculpress/locgovpress2001/754241/;jsessionid=RXZvKQ1FvJs1GL2HpQR2qr7G2J7W9f505J1tpJ3wJ5MJ30n2Dfjx!514291769?cr=1 & lang=en | title= Groundbreaking ceremony for new National Assembly building| publisher= [[National Assembly for Wales]]| accessdate=2009-07-19}} < /ref >  contains the ''debating chamber'' and 3 committee rooms for the [[Welsh Parliament]] in [[Cardiff]]. The building is 5,308 square meters (57,100 sq ft) large. 
 
 == History == 
 After 2 selection processes were held, it was decided a new debating chamber for [[Wales]] was to built on a new site,'' Site 1E,'' at Capital Waterside in [[Cardiff|Cardiff Bay]].   
 
 === Design === 
 Richard Rogers, an architect who had won the [[Pritzker Prize]], won the international competition to design the building. It was designed to be [[Sustainable development|sustainable]], with [[Renewable resource|renewable]] technologies, and to be energy efficient. The building was awarded an  " Excellent "  certification by the'' Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method'', the highest ever certification to be awarded in Wales, and was nominated for the 2006 Stirling Prize. The Senedd is now a symbol of [[Cardiff]], and [[Wales]]. 
 
 === Building the Senedd === 
 The Senedd was constructed in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second starting in August 2003, until it was handed over to the [[National Assembly for Wales|National Assembly]] in February 2006. 
 
 Between the phases, the [[National Assembly for Wales|National Assembly]] changed contractors and the management structure of the project, but kept Rogers as architect. 
 
 Once finished, the building cost almost 6 times more than expected, and was finished 4 years and 10 months late (compared to estimates in 1997). 
 
 The cost grew because of the extra security that had to be added after the [[September 11 attacks]], and because the [[National Assembly for Wales|National Assembly]] did not have an independent estimate of the project's cost until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. The costs of the second phase grew by less than 6% over budget, and was 6 months late, because of [[ICT]] problems. 
 
 It was opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 1 March 2006 and it cost £69.6 million, which included £49.7 million in construction costs. The Senedd is part of the land owned by the National Assembly that includes Tŷ Hywel and the [[Pierhead Building]].
