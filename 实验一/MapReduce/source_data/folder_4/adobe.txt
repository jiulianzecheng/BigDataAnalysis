 '''Adobe''' is a building material made from [[soil]] and often [[organic matter]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.solidearth.co.nz/adobe-brick-technique.php |title=Solid Earth Adobe Buildings  |publisher=SolidEarth.co.nz |access-date=January 8, 2017}} < /ref >  Adobe means [[mudbrick]] in Spanish. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adobe |title=adobe |website=Meram-Webster Dictionaries |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |access-date=January 8, 2017}} < /ref >  It can also mean any kind of earth construction.  
 
 Adobe is one of the earliest building materials ever used. < ref name=preservationNPS > {{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/5-adobe-buildings.htm#adobe |title=Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings |website= Technical Preservation Services |publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior |access-date=January 8, 2017}} < /ref >  It is found all over the world. The techniques used in adobe construction have not changed since the [[16th century]] in the [[Southwestern United States]]. < ref name=preservationNPS/ >  Because they are not [[fire]]d in a [[kiln]] they never become hard. < ref name=preservationNPS/ >  They [[wikt:shrink|shrink]] and [[wikt:swell|swell]] as the water content in them changes. < ref name=preservationNPS/ >  Also, as they get [[wikt:wet|wet]]ter, they become [[wikt:weak|weak]]er. < ref name=preservationNPS/ > 
 
 Adobe does not permanently stick to [[wood]], [[metal]] or stone because it moves more than they do. < ref name=preservationNPS/ >  This causes [[Cracking joints|cracks]] and [[wikt:seperation|seperation]] from other materials. < ref name=preservationNPS/ >  Stone is sometimes used as a [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] and wood for the [[roof]]. < ref name=preservationNPS/ >  These are usually held in place by their own [[wikt:weight|weight]] or the weight of the adobe pressing down on them. < ref name=preservationNPS/ >  But adobe construction is cheap and the materials are usually easy to find.
