 {{nihongo|'''''Nintendogs'''''|ニンテンドッグス|Nintendoggusu|lead=yes}} is a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. In ''Nintendogs'', the player has [[dogs]]. At the start of the game one can choose a type of dog and give it a name. They give the dogs [[food]] and [[drink]]s. If a dog is good one might get to feed them a dog biscuit or a jerky treat. The dogs can be [[Washing|washed]], taken for a walk, [[teach|taught]] to do tricks and put into [[contest]]s. The contests are: agility trial, disc competition and obedience trial. One can find out how to compete in these contests by looking at their care books, under Supplies. 
 
 There are [[four]] versions of the game each with different [[breed]]s. 
 They are: ''Dalmatian and Friends'', ''Chihuahua and Friends'', ''Labrador and Friends'' and ''Dachshund and Friends''. All breeds are unlockable in every version and a player can unlock dogs by increasing his trainer points. However, the player can only have three dogs at home. To get more the player must drop off one at the Dog Hotel. Every player can only drop off five dogs at a time. 
 
 If the player does not play the game for a long period of time, the dog may run away, so players need to play with their dogs daily. 
 
 A sequel, ''Nintendogs + Cats'', was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2011.
