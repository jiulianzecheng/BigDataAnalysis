 The '''Iznassen''' ([[Berber languages|Berber]]: ⴰⵜ ⵉⵣⵏⴰⵙⵙⵏ) or '''At Iznassen''' or '''Beni Znassen''' or '''Beni-Snassen''' (Singular : Aznass) is a great historical confederation of [[Berber]] [[Zenata|zenati]] tribes originating from the north-east [[Morocco]], in the provinces of [[Oujda]], Berkane and Taourirt; the largest one in Eastern Morocco.

 == History == 
 The Iznassen are Berber but Arabized, that is to say that they are of Berber origin but speak mainly only Arabic. They nevertheless include a minority of Arab fractions. 
 
 The Iznassen are divided into 4 Berber tribes : 
 
 * Ayt Khaled 
 * Ayt Menqouch 
 * Ayt 'Atiq 
 * Ayt Ourimech 
 
 == Etymology == 
 Iznassen in the Berber Zenati language is the [[plural]] of “Aznass” which is made of “Azn” meaning “Send” and “Ass” meaning “The Day”. Iznassen [[Literal translation|literally]] means  " Those who send (during) the Day " .

 == Language == 
 The east of Morocco has many different languages. Beni Iznasen has both Arabic-speaking and Berber-speaking [[Political party|political groups]]. [[Bilingualism]] sometimes occurs, mainly in the older [[generations]]. The younger generations usually only speak Arabic. 
 
 === Arabic === 
 The Arabic [[dialect]] of eastern Morocco is the so-called Hilali dialect. It is similar to the dialects of [[Marrakech]] and [[Casablanca]]. It is different to the urban (pre-Hilali) dialects of [[Fez, Morocco|Fes]] and the north of Morocco. This Arabic dialect also is similar to the dialect of western [[Algeria]] ([[Tlemcen]]), which borders the Beni Iznasen area. 
 
 === Berber === 
 Those who speak the most Berber are the older generations of the Ait Iznassen people. The Berber dialect of eastern Morocco is almost similair to East Riffian and the Berber of Beni Snous tribe near Tlemcen in Algeria. 
 
 Since the Berber language was made an [[official language]] of Morocco in 2011, schools are now teaching the language to new generations.
