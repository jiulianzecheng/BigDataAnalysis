 A supergroup sometimes forms as a [[side project]] for a single recording project or similar purposes, with no intention that the group will remain together afterwards. In other instances, the group may become the primary focus of the members' career. 
 
 ==Criticism== 
 In 1974, a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article titled  " Return of a Supergroup "  said that the supergroup was a  " potent but short-lived rock phenomenon "  which was an  " amalgam formed by the talented malcontents of other bands. "  The article acknowledged that groups such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Blind Faith]]  " played enormous arenas and made megabucks, and sometimes megamusic " , with the performances  " fueled by dueling egos. "  However, while this  " musical infighting built up the excitement ... it also made breakups inevitable. " 
 
 ==History== 
 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor Jann Wenner credited British rock band Cream, which came together in 1966, as the first supergroup. [[Eric Clapton]], formerly of rock band [[The Yardbirds]] and blues rock band [[John Mayall  &  the Bluesbreakers]]; Jack Bruce, formerly of jazz/rhythm and blues band the Graham Bond Organisation (GBO) and John Mayall  &  the Bluesbreakers; and Ginger Baker, formerly of the GBO, formed the band in 1966, recorded four albums, and disbanded in 1968. Guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker went on to form Blind Faith, another blues rock supergroup which recruited former the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic singer, keyboardist, and guitarist [[Steve Winwood]] and Family bassist Ric Grech. The group recorded one studio album before disbanding less than a year after formation. Also in 1968 Jack Bruce joined the Tony Williams Lifetime, composed of bassist and vocalist Bruce, and three famous [[Miles Davis]] alumni: drummer Tony Williams, guitarist John McLaughlin, and keyboardist Khalid Yasin (né Larry Young). 
 
 The term may have come from the 1968 album ''Super Session'' with Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield, and [[Stephen Stills]]. The coalition of Crosby, Stills  &  Nash (later [[Crosby, Stills, Nash  &  Young]]) in 1969 is another early example, given the success of their prior bands ([[The Byrds]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[The Hollies]] respectively).
