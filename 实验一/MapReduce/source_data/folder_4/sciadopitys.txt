 '''''Sciadopitys''''',  the Japanese umbrella-pine, is a unique [[conifer]]. It is [[endemic]] to [[Japan]], and the sole surviving member of the family '''Sciadopityaceae'''. It is a [[living fossil]] with no close relatives: its fossils date from 230 million years ago. 
 
 It is an [[evergreen]] [[tree]] that can grow 15-27m tall. It's brown main shoots have whorls of 7–12cm long flexible green  " cladodes " . These look like, and perform the function of, [[leaf|leaves]] but are actually composed of [[Plant stem|stem]] tissue. Occasionally, a cladode will fork and produce a [[wikt:bud|bud]] in the 'v' of the fork, just like a normal stem. 
 
 The [[conifer cone|cones]] are 6–11 & nbsp;cm long, mature in about 18 months, and have flattish scales that open to release the [[seed]]s. 
 
 It is a very attractive tree and is popular in gardens, despite its slow growth rate and high cost. Koyamaki was chosen as the [[mon (badge)|Japanese Imperial crest]] for [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino]], currently third in line to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]]. 
 
 The plant was first introduced to [[Europe]] by [[John Gould Veitch]] in September 1860. < ref name =  " Hortus Veitchii " > {{cite book | author=James Herbert Veitch| title=Hortus Veitchii| publisher=Caradoc Doy | year=2006|edition=reprint|pages=51–52| isbn=0-9553515-0-2}} < /ref >
