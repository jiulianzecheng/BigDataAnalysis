 A '''skirmisher''' is a [[soldier]] usually sent ahead of a main body of troops to [[harass]] the [[enemy]]. < ref name=Farwell764 > Byron Farwell, ''The Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-century Land Warfare: An Illustrated World View'' (New York: Norton, 2001), p. 764 < /ref >  Groups of skirmishers may also be placed on the flanks to prevent a surprise attack or [[flanking maneuver]]. < ref name=Farwell764/ >  A '''skirmish''' is a term that was first used in the [[14th century]]. < ref name=Bradford1189 > ''International Encyclopedia of Military History'', ed. James C. Bradford (London; New York: Routledge, 2006), p. 1189 < /ref >  It meant a small-scale fight between two opposing forces or a [[wikt:preliminary|preliminary]] [[battle]] involving troops in front of the main force. < ref name=Bradford1189/ >  Skirmishers were those involved in the fight or battle. The word from the [[Old French]] ''eskirmir''  " to defend " . < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/skirmish |title=skirmish |website=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |access-date=21 June 2016}} < /ref >  Skirmishers were usually [[infantry]] or [[cavalry]] soldiers who formed a skirmish line ahead or next to friendly troops. 
 
 == History == 
 === Colonial America === 
 Two conflicts that involved the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] and the development of skirmishers were the [[Seven Years' War]] (the [[French and Indian War]] in the American colonies) and the [[American Revolutionary War]]. < ref name=TWC > {{cite web |url=http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?556814-History-Skirmishers-of-19th-Century-and-American-Civil-War |title=Skirmishers of 19Th Century and American Civil War |publisher=total War Center|access-date=21 June 2016}} < /ref >  The main development of skirmisher [[Military tactics|tactic]]s came from the [[Native American]] allied primarily to the [[England|English]] and [[France|French]]. < ref name=TWC/ >  Indian [[warrior]]s did not usually fight in the European style of closely-packed formations of soldiers but more often fought as individuals. They used cover, [[ambush]] and lines of fighters, which would later come to be called skirmishing. < ref name=TWC/ > 
 
 === Napoleonic Wars === 
 The tactics of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] called for heavy cavalry to be kept in [[wikt:reserve|reserve]]. < ref name=Haythornthwaite28 > Philip Haythornthwaite, ''Napoleonic Light Cavalry Tactics'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 2013), p. 28 < /ref >  Light cavalry were often used as skirmishers < ref name=Haythornthwaite28/ >   and were usually positioned on the sides of an army and served two purposes. In  " skirmish order " , they could be placed some distance from the main force. < ref name=Haythornthwaite28/ >  That way, they could warn the commander if any enemy approached from that way. < ref name=Haythornthwaite28/ >  The other purpose was to use their quick speed to engage the enemy and to hold them until more forces arrived. < ref name=Haythornthwaite28/ >  By their very presence, they [[wikt:discourage|discourage]]d the enemy from mounting a flanking attack. < ref name=Haythornthwaite28/ > 
 
 === American Civil War === 
 During the [[American Civil War]], infantry [[manual]]s paid a good deal of attention to skirmishing. < ref name=CWH > {{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/terms.html |title=Definitions of Civil War Terms |publisher=Home of the American Civil War |access-date=21 June 2016}} < /ref >  The tactics were based on [[Napoleon]]'s heavy [[wikt:dependence|dependence]] on skirmishing during the Napoleonic Wars. < ref name=CWH/ >  [[Painting]]s and images of Civil War battles show two lines of soldiers, standing [[shoulder]] to shoulder and firing at the enemy lines at short distances. < ref name=goffMVEP > {{cite web |url=http://www.mvep.org/skirmishold.htm |title=Skirmish Doctrine |author=Kent J. Goff |publisher=Mississippi Valley Educational Programs |access-date=21 June 2016}} < /ref >  However, [[Military organization|massed formations]] were not frequently used during the Civil War. < ref name=goffMVEP/ >  Skirmishes and skirmish lines were a more common tactic. < ref name=goffMVEP/ > 
 
 The [[terrain]] in many cases did not allow mass formations of armies but allowed skirmishers to fight in open order. The increased accuracy of [[rifles]] and rifled [[musket]]s at longer ranges made battles fought at close range unnecessary. Battles fought before at {{convert|100|yd}} could now be fought at {{convert|400|yd}}. < ref name= " goffMVEP "  / >  Pre-war training had also changed skirmisher tactics. Instead of one [[company (military)|company]] out of ten, entire [[regiment]]s were now taught how to fight as skirmishers. They fought in small formations, called “comrades in battle”. That called for four men to move and fight supporting one another. < ref name= " goffMVEP "  / > 
 
 The [[Confederate Army]] actually made more effective use of skirmishers. In each [[brigade]] there was an [[wikt:elite|elite]] [[battalion]] of [[Marksman|sharpshooters]], who were used as skirmishers. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://johnsmilitaryhistory.com/cwarmy.html |title=Civil War Tactics in Perspective |author=John Hamill |publisher=JohnsMilitaryHistory.com |access-date=21 June 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 === Plains Indian Wars === 
 During the [[American Indian Wars#West of the Mississippi (1811–1924)|Plains Indian Wars]], especially after the Civil War, the [[United States Army|US Army]] used companies of skirmishers ahead of the main force. < ref name=Chun61 > Clayton Chun, ''US Army in the Plains Indian Wars 1865–1891'' (Oxford, UK: Osprey Publishing, 2004), p. 61 < /ref >  The recommended distance between them was {{convert|5|yd}}, but most commanders simply kept skirmishers within sight of one another. < ref name=Chun61/ >  The skirmishers were used mainly ahead of the main force but could be used to defend the flanks or as a [[rearguard]]. 
 
 If the [[Native American|Indians]] attacked, the skirmisher company formed a defensive circle. < ref name= " Chun61 "  / >  Once the danger had passed, they returned to their original positions. < ref name= " Chun61 "  / >  Often, the entire company was not deployed as skirmishers. Some were kept in reserve to fill gaps, to get [[ammunition]] or to carry messages. < ref name= " Chun61 "  / >
