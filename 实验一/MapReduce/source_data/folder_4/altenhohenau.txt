Ten nuns from Schönensteinback went to St. Catherine's convent in Nuremberg. Before the reform, the library at St. Catherine's had 45 books. After the reform it had 500-600 books. The nuns at St. Catherine's helped other convents with their libraries. The convents needed books for the new prayers and rules of the reform. They helped St. Catherine's convent in St. Gall to copy books. They gave many books to the convents at Fraenaurach and Altenhohenau. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybP8CTC6Yi0C|title=Women and the Book: Assessing the Visual Evidence|first1=Lesley|last1=Smith|first2=Jane H.
