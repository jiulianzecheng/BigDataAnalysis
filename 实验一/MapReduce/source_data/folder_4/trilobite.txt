 '''Trilobites''' ( " three lobes " ) are [[extinct]] [[arthropod]]s. They were the first animals known to have eyes, although some were secondarily blind. They were very numerous during the early [[Palaeozoic]] [[era]].  
 
 Their distribution was worldwide, but only in [[salt water]] [[environments]]. They disappeared in the [[Permianâ€“Triassic extinction event]]. 
 
 Trilobites had many lifestyles. Some moved over the [[sea floor]] as [[predator]]s, [[scavenger]]s, or [[filter feeder]]s. Some swam, feeding on [[plankton]]. Most [[ecological niche]] < nowiki/ > s of modern marine arthropods are seen in trilobites. 
 
 Their bodies were divided into three parts: the [[head]] (cephalon), the [[thorax]] (chest) made of up to 30 segments, and the [[tail]] (pygidium). Underneath, and rarely preserved, are three pairs of legs for the head. There are paired legs for each pleural groove.  
 
 Trilobites are the earliest known animal to have vision. The earliest trilobites had complex, [[compound eye]]s with [[lens]]es made of [[calcite]]. Some trilobites had small eyes or no eyes at all, and probably lived in dark or muddy environments. 
 
 Trilobites ranged in length from {{convert|1|mm|2}} to {{convert|72|cm}}, with a typical size range of {{convert|3|-|10|cm|abbr=on}}. The world's largest trilobite, ''Isotelus rex'', was found in 1998 by Canadian scientists on the shores of [[Hudson Bay]].

 Trilobites appeared some 600 million years ago during the [[Cambrian]] period. They belonged (probably) to the [[phylum]] [[Arthropoda]]. This phylum includes the most successful (78%) of all animal life forms, including [[crab]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[spider]]s, [[shrimp]]s and [[insect]]s. The trilobites, living in [[wikt:shallow|shallow]] seas, flourished as swimmers, crawlers and burrowers for some 350 million years. Over time, they evolved rapidly into a wide variety of strange and beautiful forms. 
 
 == Discovery == 
 They were first pictured some 25,000 years ago in a [[France]] cave. Two specimens were found in a [[Cro-magnon]] settlement, at a site called  " La Grotte du Trilobite " . One was found with a hole drilled into it and worn as an adornment. Others have been found in the tombs of [[Egypt]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]]. Trilobite fossils were sold on the street of 15th Century [[Europe]] and collected by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].
