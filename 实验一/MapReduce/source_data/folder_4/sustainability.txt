 '''Sustainability''' means that a process or state can be maintained at a certain level for as long as is wanted. 
 
 One definition of sustainability is the one created by the [[Brundtland Commission]], led by the former Norwegian Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]. The Commission defined [[sustainable development]] as development that  " meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. " < ref > United Nations. 1987. [http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm  " Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. " ] General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987.  Retrieved: 2007-04-12 < /ref > 
 
 Sustainability relates to the connection of [[Economics|economic]], [[Society|social]], [[institution]]al and [[Natural environment|environmental]] aspects of human [[society]], as well as the non-[[human]] environment. < ref > Bridge, C.
