 :''Sound can also mean a body of [[water]], like a [[bay]] or [[Canal|channel]].'' 
 
 '''Sound''' is caused by sound [[wave (physics)|waves]]. It can be [[hearing|heard]] when goes through a [[Media|medium]] to the [[ear]]. All sounds are made by [[vibration]]s of molecules. For example, when a person hits a [[drum]] or a [[cymbal]] the object [[vibration|vibrates]]. These vibrations make [[air]] [[molecule]]s move. Sound waves move away from where they came from. When the vibrating air molecules reach our [[ear]]s, the [[eardrum]] vibrates, too. The bones of the ear vibrate in the way the object that started the sound wave vibrates. 
 
 There are three different mediums. They are [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]. Sound travels fastest through solids because the particles in a solid are closer together than they are in gases and liquids. 
 
 These vibrations let you hear different things. Even [[music]] is vibrations. Irregular vibrations are [[noise]]. People can make very complex sounds. We use them for [[speech]].  
 
 Sound waves are [[longitudinal wave]]s with two parts: ''[[compression]]'' and ''rarefaction''. Compression is the part of the sound waves where the air molecules are pushed (''compressed'') together. Rarefaction is the part of the waves where the molecules are far away from each other. Sound waves are a [[sequence]] of compression and rarefaction. 
 
 == Vacuum == 
 Since sound is a vibration of a medium, it cannot go through a [[vacuum]]. A vacuum is a place where there is no medium, for example in [[outer space]]. The word comes from the [[Latin]] adjective ''vacuus'' for  " vacant "  or  " void " .  
 
 == Speed of sound == 
 {{Main|Speed of sound}} 
 Sound waves can travel through [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es. The thicker the medium, the faster it goes, but they cannot travel through a [[vacuum]] (a place with nothing in it). This is why [[astronaut]]s cannot talk to each other in space: they need a [[radio]] to hear each other. Sound can travel through water faster than through air; and even faster in solids like [[stone]], [[iron]], and [[steel]]. At room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure, sound travels at 344 m/s (1134 ft/s), 761 miles per hour). Because the temperature and pressure change with altitude in the atmosphere, speed will vary as well. < ref name=whee > ''The Earth and the Universe'' LIFEPAC Science, p. 33 < /ref >   
 
 == Pitch and Intensity == 
 
 ''Pitch'' is the highness or lowness of sound. [[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is how humans hear different frequencies. [[Frequency]] is determined by the number of vibrations per second. The highest key played on a [[piano]], for instance, vibrates 4,000 times per second. It has a frequency of 4000 [[hertz]] (Hz), or 4 kilohertz (kHz). Lower keys have lower frequencies. A note an [[octave]] higher than another note has a frequency twice of that note. < ref name=whee/ >   
 
 The intensity of sound is how much sound energy goes through a square meter in one second. Sound waves with higher amplitude (bigger vibration) have higher intensity. The intensity of sound is higher closer to the sound source. Farther away, it's less intense. The [[inverse-square law]] shows how sound intensity becomes smaller, farther from the source.  " Inverse square "  says that when distance gets multiplied by a number, sound intensity gets divided by that number squared (the number times itself). < ref name=whee/ >  Thus, twice the distance means a quarter the intensity.  
 
 Sound intensities can be very different. They can range from 0.000000000001, which are barely heard, to 1 W/m < sup > 2 < /sup >   (painfully loud). The [[decibel]] scale makes sound intensity numbers easier to work with. A 0.000000000001 W/m < sup > 2 < /sup >  intensity is 0 dB (decibels). It is an exponential scale, so when the decibel number increases by 10, the intensity is ten times as much. So, a 1 W/m < sup > 2 < /sup >  intensity is 120 dB. 
 
 Loudness is how people sense the intensity of sound. Loudness depends on sound intensity, sound frequency, and the person's hearing. 
 
 === Heard and not seen === 
 
 Audible sound has [[frequency|frequencies]] between 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 20 & nbsp;kHz. [[Human being]]s can hear audible sound. Sound waves that have a frequency above 20 & nbsp;kHz are called [[ultrasound]] waves. Sound waves that have a frequency below 20 & nbsp;Hz are called [[infrasound]] waves. Human beings cannot hear ultrasound waves and infrasound waves, but some animals, like [[bat]]s and [[dolphin]]s, use them. Older people have an even smaller hearing range. People are best at hearing sounds between 1000 & nbsp;Hz and 6000 & nbsp;Hz. 
 
 ===The Doppler Effect=== 
 When a sound source is moving towards someone, the frequency seems to increase. The same thing happens when someone moves toward the sound source. Frequency seems to decrease when someone moves away from the sound source. It also seems to decrease when the sound source moves away from someone. This is called the [[Doppler effect]].
