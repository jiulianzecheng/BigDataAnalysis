 '''Subspecies''' is a classification ([[taxonomy]]) in [[biology]]. It is directly below [[species]]. When looking at the [[Latin language|Latin]] name, subspecies are indicated by the third name. Subspecies can mix with each other; animals or plants from different subspecies can have offspring together (This is usually not the case with animals from different species). 
 
 When looking at subspecies, they can also be told apart sufficiently by looking at the [[Phenotype|appearance]] or [[DNA]] of an [[animal]] or [[plant]]. 
 
 Very often, there are populations that are between two subspecies; this is because [[evolution]] is a continuous process. Subspecies can often be recognised by ''subsp'' or ''ssp'' (before the third part of the name) especially in [[botany]]. 
 
 Examples of subspecies are: 
 *The [[dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') and the [[dingo]] (''Canis lupus dingo'') are both subspecies of the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') 
 *The [[cat|domestic cat]] (''Felis silvestris catus'') is a subspecies of the [[European wildcat|wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris'') 
 
 ==Nominate subspecies== 
 In [[zoology]], when a [[species]] is split into subspecies, the first described population is known as the  " nominate subspecies " , and it repeats the same name as the species. For example, the  " Daboia russelii russelii "  (known as the Indian Russell's Viper) is a nominate subspecies of the species  " Daboia russelii "  (known as the Russell's Viper).
