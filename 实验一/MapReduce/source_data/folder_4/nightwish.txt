 '''Nightwish''' is a [[symphonic metal music|symphonic metal]] [[band]] from [[Finland]]. They formed in July 1996 and played [[acoustic music|acoustic]] mood [[music]]. The band's [[keyboardist]] and [[composer]] Tuomas Holopainen had the idea of forming a band. He asked Tarja Turunen to [[singer|sing]] and Emppu Vuorinen to play [[guitar]]. 
 
 At the beginning of 1997, the band started playing stronger music. Jukka Nevalainen joined the band to play the [[drums]]. Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar. In May 1997, Nightwish signed a [[contract]] (binding agreement) with Spinefarm Records and they released their first album 'Angels Fall First'. 
 
 In 1998, Sami Vänskä joined the band to play [[bass guitar]]. The same year Nightwish released 'Oceanborn', which was quite different to 
 'Angels Fall First'. 
 
 In May 2000 they released 'Wishmaster', which was similar to 'Oceanborn'. They also entered the contest to be Finland's representatives for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], with the song 'Sleepwalker'. They won the phone [[vote]] but the judges disagreed so they came second. 
 
 The other band members asked Tarja to leave the group in 2005 after their  " End of an Era "  tour. Tuomas wrote an open letter to her, stating the reasons why she had to leave. He then put the letter on the official website. In 2007, Swedish singer Anette Olzon became the new singer, and Nightwish released a single, 'Amaranth'. A few months later, they released the album 'Dark Passion Play'.
