'''''Psychonauts'''''  is an action-adventure [[platformer]] [[video game]] created by [[Double Fine]]. It was made for the [[Xbox]], [[Playstation 2]], and [[PC]], and was later brought to [[Xbox 360]] through the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, and Apple Computers through [[Steam]]. The main character, Rasputin, is a Psychonaut, or psychic who travels through people's minds. Although Psychonauts initially did poorly regarding sales, the game is well known for being very creative and having a [[cult following]]. A sequel has recently been rumored to be developed by [[Double Fine]] and produced by Markus  " Notch "  Persson, millionaire, and creator of ''[[Minecraft]]'' and [[Mojang Studios]]. [[Tim Schafer]], founder of Double Fine, predicts ''Psychonauts 2'' to cost $13 million to make.
