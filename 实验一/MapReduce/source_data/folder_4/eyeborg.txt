An '''eyeborg''' or '''eye-borg''' is an electronic eye that allows people to hear colors. It is mostly used by blind people or by people with [[color blindness]]. It works by using a head mounted camera that reads the colors directly in front of a person, and converts them into musical notes. < ref > Alfredo M.

 The first eyeborg was made in England in 2003 by Adam Montandon in collaboration with colourblind artist Neil Harbisson. The invention won a British award in Innovation (Submerge 2004) < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515193805/http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=10944 Submerge Innovation Award] (Bristol, 2004){{dead link|date=April 2013}} < /ref >  and a European award in Content Tools and Interface Design (Europrix 2004). < ref > [[Europrix]] Europrix Awards < /ref >  In 2007, Peter Kese, a software developer from [[Slovenia]], made further developments to the eyeborg by increasing the number of colors to 360 and adding color intensity through different volume levels. < ref > Harbisson, Neil.
