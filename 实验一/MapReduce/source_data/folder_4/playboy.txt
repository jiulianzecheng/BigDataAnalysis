 In each issue, a provocatively posed  " Playmate of the Month "  was featured in a pictorial several pages in length at the center of the magazine with an accompanying  " centerfold "  photograph. Unlike traditional pin up art, ''Playboy'' humanized their models by describing their real world jobs, accomplishments, and goals. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSI7Q-uVS5oC & dq=playmate+magazine & pg=PA83|title=Historicizing Lifestyle|isbn=9781409490630|last1=Hollows|first1=Joanne|last2=Bell|first2=Mr David|date=December 28, 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 In 1963 Hefner was arrested for obscenity in Chicago after publishing nude photos of actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] that were taken on the set of ''Promises! Promises!''  He was acquitted at trial by a [[hung jury]].
