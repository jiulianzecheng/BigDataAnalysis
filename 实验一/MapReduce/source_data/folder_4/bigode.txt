He was known for marking opponents, tackling and his long range of passing and he was a quick defender and he is considered to be one of the best left-backs ever. His main virtue was his physical power, with great power and speed he made efficient markings and the rival wingers had difficulties to overcome him one on one.

In 1943 he moved to Fluminense and played there for six years, winning the state championship in 1946 and he was a key player for the club. He then went on to play for arch-rival Flamengo in 1949 where he formed a formidable defensive duo with [[Juvenal Amarijo|Juvenal]] which was regarded as one of the best defences of all time, and returned to his old love Fluminense in 1952, where he also ended his career in 1956.

They reached the final, known as the Maracanaço. Bigode had to mark [[Alcides Ghiggia]] during the final match. Nobody expected Brazil to lose at home to Uruguay, Bigode played a bad game, [[Alcides Ghiggia|Ghiggia]] dribbled past him on both goals and he was blamed for the defeat along with [[Moacir Barbosa Nascimento|Barbosa]] and [[Juvenal Amarijo|Juvenal]]. After the match he was no longer called up for the national team, but in 1952 he returned to the Brazilian national team after his absence for 2 years. In 1953 he was selected to play for Copa América, He made a formidable midfield trio with [[José Carlos Bauer|Bauer]] and [[Danilo Alvim|Danilo]] and showed one of his best performances during that tournament as a tough tackler and a ball-winner after the tournament he retired from the Seleção for good.
