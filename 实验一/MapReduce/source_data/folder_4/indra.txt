 '''{{IAST|Indra}}''' ([[Devanagari]]: इन्द्र) or {{IAST|Śakra}} is the most important among the [[India|Indo]]-[[Aryan]] [[Deity|gods]]. He is the God of war, the god of thunderstorms. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/592191 |title=Indra in the Rig-Veda |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|doi=10.2307/592191 |first=Edward Delavan|volume=11|date=1885| last= Perry |accessdate=12 July 2012 |page=121|jstor=592191 }} < /ref >  In the [[Veda]]s, many [[verse]]s (hymns) are there in his praise. The [[Rigveda]] praises him as a very strong [[God]]. Many [[Hindu scripture]]s tell about Indra, his character and his deeds. 
 
 Indra resides in a [[Mythology|mythical]] city located above in the [[sky]]. The city’s name is [[Amravati]]. He lives there with his wife named Indrani, and several other smaller gods. There are many [[apsara]]s in amravati. 
 
 Indra was a very important God during the Vedic period. Later his importance became less. Gods like [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]] became more important in Hinduism.   
 
 Indra in current form of mythology is similar to that of Zeus in Greek mythology. Though his importance has come down, he is still considered to be king of Gods. His status is below that of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. Thus, he is considered to be king of lesser Gods. 
 
 Again, his weapon is Vajra which is represented by Thunderbolt! His means, at times, treacherous and he is shown as, at times, jealous and vengeful. Further, he is made to suffer his own bad deeds.
