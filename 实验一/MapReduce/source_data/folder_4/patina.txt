 A '''patina''' is a [[wikt:coating|coating]] of various [[chemical compound]]s such as [[oxides]] or [[carbonate]]s formed on the surface of [[metal]] or other material. Often this is due to exposure to [[weather]]. The word  " patina "  comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning  " shallow dish " . < ref > ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', ed. Angus Stevenson (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 1302 < /ref >  For many works of [[art]] the patina adds to its value. < ref name=Gilmore88 > Jonathan Gilmore, ''The Life of a Style: Beginnings and Endings in the Narrative History of Art'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000), p. 88  &  nn. < /ref >  In many cases, the [[artist]] wanted the work to acquire a patina over time. < ref name=Gilmore88/ > 
 
 == Natural patina == 
 A patina layer takes many years to develop under natural weathering. [[Building]]s in damp [[climate]]s will develop patina layers faster than ones in dry areas. The [[facade]]s of many buildings are made of [[copper]], [[brass]] or [[bronze]], for [[example]]. These will produce different [[color]]s after natural weathering. 
 Copper takes on a natural green or blue-green patina. Bronze takes on a brown color. < ref name=Gayle27 > Margot Gayle; et al., ''Metals in America's Historic Buildings'' (Washington, DC: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, National Park Service, Cultural Resources, Preservation Assistance, 1992), p. 27 < /ref >  Early civilizations used bronze extensively. The [[Bronze Age]] is named for it. In the [[United States]], bronze was rarely used in buildings before the [[American Civil War]]. < ref name=Gayle27/ >  [[Marble]], especially white marble, was used in [[Ancient Greece|classical Greek]] and Roman [[statue]]s. It takes on a light golden patina over time. < ref > ''Ancient Stones: Quarrying, Trade and Provenance '', eds. Marc Waelkens; Norman Herz; Luc Moens (Leuven: University Press, 1992), p. 278 < /ref >   
 
 Often, [[wikt:antique|antique]] and well-used [[gun|firearm]]s will develop a patina on the [[steel]] after the bluing, parkerizing, or other finish has worn off. Firearms in this condition are generally considered more valuable than ones that have been re-blued or parkerized. The patina protects the firearm from the more damaging [[rust]] that would occur if the patina were polished off. Rust is sometimes valued as a patina. Examples are [[rat rod]]s, custom cars and meant to look like early 1940s [[hot rod]]s. They glorify rusted hot rods that have an almost [[cartoon]]ish appearance. Some are actually rusted metal while others have a [[faux]] (false) finish intended to look like rust. < ref > Dennis W. Parks, ''Hot Rod Body and Chassis Builder's Guide'' (Minneapolis: MBI Publishing Co.; Motorbooks, 2009), p. 70 < /ref > 
 
 == Faux patinas == 
 Copper items, lamps, fixtures and outdoor projects can be made to look weathered by use of [[paint]]s or [[chemical]]s. For example, a 50/50 mix of [[ammonia]] and [[Vinegar|white vinegar]] will give copper an aged patina. < ref name=Browning115 > Marie Browning, ''Inspired by the Garden'' (Cincinnati, OH: North Light Books, 2004), p. 115 < /ref >  [[Architect]]s and [[craft]]speople use [[copper sulfate]] on copper items to make them look old. Patina Green is another product used to give copper an instant aged look. < ref > Janet Marinelli, 'Restoration Products', ''Old-House Journal'', Vol XVII, No.  (May/June 1989), p. 54 < /ref >  [[Woodworking|Woodworkers]] and [[Wood finishing|wood finishers]] mix their own [[wood stain]]s. This is to match finishes on wood [[furniture]] to the same color, tone and patina of the original finish. < ref > ''More Finishes and Finishing Techniques'', ed. Fine Woodworking (Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 1997), p. 53 < /ref >
