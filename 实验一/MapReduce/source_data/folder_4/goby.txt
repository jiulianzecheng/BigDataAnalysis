 The '''gobies''' are [[teleost]] [[fish]] of the family '''Gobiidae'''. This is one of the largest families of fish, with more than 2,000 [[species]] in more than 200 [[genera]]. Most are relatively small, less than 10 & nbsp;cm (4 & nbsp;in) in length. 
 
 Although few are important as food for humans, they are of great significance as prey species for commercially important fish like [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[sea bass]], and [[flatfish]].
