 The title (originally  " Master and Commander " ) originated in the 18th century [[Royal Navy]] for naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a [[Lieutenant]] but too small to warrant the assignment of a Post-[[captain]]. < ref > Post-captains were formally appointed as Captains, whereas anyone commanding a naval vessel was addressed by the courtesy title of 'captain'. < /ref >   
 
 In practice, these were usually unrated [[sloop]]s-of-war of no more than 20 guns. The Royal Navy shortened  " Master and Commander "  to  " Commander "  in 1794; however, the term  " Master and Commander "  remained in common use for many years. < ref name= " NHC " > Naval Historical Center: Why is the Colonel called a 'Kernal?'|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/trivia/triv4-5h.htm|year=1998{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  A corresponding rank in some navies is [[Frigate Captain|frigate captain]].
