 A '''thrombus''', or '''blood clot''' stops [[bleeding]]. It keeps blood inside a damaged blood vessel, and stops the [[hemorrhage]]. 
 
 A blood clot is the final product of the [[coagulation]]. There are  aggregated [[platelets]] and [[red blood cell]]s. Together with [[fibrin]] they form a plug, and stop the bleeding. 
 
 The substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called '''cruor'''.  
 
 A thrombus is a healthy response to [[injury]] to prevent bleeding, but can be harmful in [[thrombosis]], when clots block blood flow through otherwise normal blood vessels. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|title=Robbins  &  Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease|last1=Kumar |first1=Vinay |last2=Abbas |first2=Abul |last3=Aster |first3=Jon |isbn=9781455726134|edition= 9th |publisher=Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=879416939|year = 2014}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|url=http://www.pathophys.org/vte/|title=Venous thromboembolism (VTE) {{!}} McMaster Pathophysiology Review|website=www.pathophys.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103131345/http://www.pathophys.org/vte/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
