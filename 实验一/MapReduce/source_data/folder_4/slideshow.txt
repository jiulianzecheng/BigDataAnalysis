'''Slideshow''' means a [[show]] of '''[[slide]]s'''. It is a [[:wikt:display|display]] of several slides  for [[information]] or for [[art]]istic purposes.   
 
 Slideshows are presented using a tool, such as a [[slide projector]], an [[overhead projector]]  or in more recent years, a [[computer]] running [[presentation software]]. The word comes from the use of [[slide]]s which have been around for many years. Slides originally were projected on movie theater screens by [[magic lantern]]s as part of early [[movie house]] shows. 
 
 The word '''slideshow''' does not appear in the ''Websterâ€™s New Twentieth Century Unabridged Dictionary'' (1973 edition), but is accepted as correct [[spelling]] in [[Microsoft Word]] in both ''Office 2000'' and ''Office XP'' editions.
