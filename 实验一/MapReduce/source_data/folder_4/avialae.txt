 '''Avialae''' is a term for birds and their immediate [[extinct]] ancestors. It is a [[clade]] of [[dinosaur]]s containing their only living representatives (birds) and whatever [[coelurosaur]]s are regarded as their ancestors. There are two ways it can be defined: 
 
 == Definition by physical characters == 
 Avialae is defined as a clade based on physical characteristics. Jacques Gauthier named Avialae in 1986 as ''all dinosaurs that possessed feathered [[wing]]s used in flapping [[Bird flight|flight]], and the birds that descended from them''. < ref name= " gauthier1986 " > Gauthier, J. 1986. Saurischian monophyly and the origin of birds. In: K. Padian ed. ''The origin of birds and the evolution of flight.'' San Francisco: California, Acad.Sci. pp.1–55. (Mem.Calif.Acad.Sci.8.) < /ref > < ref name= " gauthier & dequeiroz2001 " > Gauthier J. and de Queiroz K. 2001. Feathered dinosaurs, flying dinosaurs, crown dinosaurs, and the name Aves. 7-41 in ''New perspectives on the origin and early evolution of birds: proceedings of the International Symposium in Honor of John H. Ostrom'' (J.A. Gauthier and L.F. Gall eds) Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. < /ref > 
 
 == Branch-based definition == 
 Several other authors use a similar, but branch-based, definition: ''all [[theropod]]s closer to birds than to [[Deinonychus]]''. < ref name= " weishampel2004 " > Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; Osmólska, Halszka (eds) 2004. ''The Dinosauria''. 2nd ed, University of California Press. < /ref > < ref name= " senter2007 " > Senter P. 2007. A new look at the phylogeny of Coelurosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda). ''Journal of Systematic Palaeontology'', ({{doi|10.1017/S1477201907002143}}). < /ref >
