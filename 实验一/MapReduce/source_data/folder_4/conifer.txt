 '''Conifers''' are [[gymnosperm]]s. They are [[Conifer cone|cone]]-bearing seed [[plant]]s.  
 
 All living conifers are woody plants which are [[perennial]]. Most are [[tree]]s; some are [[shrub]]s. They are the [[Division (botany)|Division]] '''Pinophyta''' or '''Coniferophyta'''. < ref > Eckenwalder, James E. 2009. ''Conifers of the world: the complete reference'', p13.

 Living conifers are all in the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Pinales'''. Typical examples include [[cedar]]s, [[cypress]]es, [[fir]]s, [[juniper]]s, [[Agathis|kauris]], [[larch]]es, [[pine]]s, [[redwood]]s, [[spruce]]s, and [[yew]]s. 
 
 Species of conifers can be found in almost all parts of the world, and are often the most common plants in their [[habitat]]s, as in the [[taiga]]. Conifers are of great economic value, and their wood is mainly used for [[timber]] and [[paper]]-making The wood of conifers is known as [[softwood]], though yew wood is actually quite hard. The division ''Coniferae'' contains about 700 living [[species]]. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 The earliest conifers were in the late [[Carboniferous]] ([[Pennsylvanian]]) period (about 300 million years ago), < ref name=henry > Henry R.J. 2005. ''Plant diversity and evolution''. London: CABI. < /ref >  Pinophytes, [[Cycad]]s, and [[Ginkgo]]s all developed at this time. < ref name= " henry "  / >  These plants live without being so dependent on water. Other [[adaptations]] are pollen (so [[fertilisation]] can occur without water) and the seed, which allows the [[Seed#Embryo|embryo]] to be transported and developed elsewhere. < ref name= " henry "  / > 
 
 Conifers appear to be one of the taxa that benefited from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]. They were the dominant land plants of the [[Mesozoic]] [[era]]. Conifers were eventually overtaken by their descendants, the  [[flowering plant]]s, which first appeared in the [[Cretaceous]]. Flowering plants became dominant in the [[Cainozoic]] era. 
 
 Conifers were a main food of [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[dinosaur]]s, and their [[resin]]s and [[poison]]s no doubt gave them some [[Defence against herbivory|protection against herbivores]]. All the reproductive features of modern conifers had evolved by the end of the Mesozoic era. < ref > Williams, Claire G. 2009. ''Conifer reproductive biology''. Springer Science. < /ref >
