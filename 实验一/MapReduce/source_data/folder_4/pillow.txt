 A '''pillow''' is a soft [[cushion]] that a person puts under their head when they are sleeping in a bed.  
 
 A pillow is made from two pieces of [[cloth]] that are sewn together and stuffed with a soft material, such as [[feather]]s, duck down, or [[synthetic]] batting (man made soft stuffing). Pillows are usually [[Rectangle|rectangular]]. Pillows are covered with a [[fabric]] sheet called a pillowcase. The pillowcase protects the pillow from getting dirty. 
 
 The word ''pillow'' comes from Middle English ''pilwe'', from Old English ''pyle'' (akin to Old High German ''pfuliwi'') and from Latin ''pulvinus''. The word ''pillow'' was first known to be used before the 12th century. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of PILLOW|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pillow|access-date=2022-10-22|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref >

 === Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt === 
 In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], people slept on stone pillows.

 [[Ancient Egypt|Anicent Egyptians]] used pillows as a solution to back, neck and shoulder pain. They also prevented insects from crawling in their hair, mouth or nose at night. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Anicent Egyptian pillows were made out of wood and stone and looked like stands. These pillows were mostly used for the deceased. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Seath|first1=J.|last2=Giże|first2=A. P.|last3=David|first3=A.
