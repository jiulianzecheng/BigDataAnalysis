In [[typography]], the terms were set when all printing was done with metal type. '''Font''' or '''fount''' was all the letters or [[wikt:character|characters]] of a single size of a [[typeface]]. For example, all characters for 9-point [[Times New Roman]] is a font, and the 10 point size would be another font. 
 
 With the increase in the use of [[personal computer]]s, the definition of '''font''' has changed. The [[term]] font is now often used as another name for a typeface. The size of the characters has no effect on fonts when using this definition.
