 '''''Titanosaurus'''''  < ref > meaning 'titanic lizard' - named after the [[Greek mythology|mythological]] '[[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]', [[Deity|deities]] of [[Ancient Greece]] < /ref >  was a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]], first described by Lydekker in 1877 from fragments, but not confirmed by later research. < ref > Lydekker R. 1877.

 Titanosaurus was 9-12 metres (30-40 ft) long and weighed about 13 tons. Titanosaurus has traditionally been treated as a  " [[wastebasket taxon]] "  for poorly preserved sauropod remains. The most well-known species of ''Titanosaurus'', [[Isisaurus| " Titanosaurus "  colberti]], has been renamed ''[[Isisaurus]]''. The remains were from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of [[India]].
