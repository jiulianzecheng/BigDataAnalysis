'''Paresthesia''' (pron. {{IPA|/ˌpɛɹɪsˈθiʒə/}}; '''paraesthesia''' in [[British English]], pron. {{IPA|/ˌpæɹɪsˈθiʒə/}}) is a feeling of tingling, prickling, or numbness with no permanent effects. It is commonly called  " pins and needles " . This feeling may last a short while, or may be more long-lasting. A long-term effect means there is something wrong with [[neuron]]s in the body. 
 
 An example of this can be felt when sitting [[Lotus position|cross-legged]] for a long time and your foot  " falls asleep " . The tingling feeling you get when you move is paresthesia.
