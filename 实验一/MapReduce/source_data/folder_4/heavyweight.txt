 In [[boxing]], the term '''heavyweight''' is used for a specific group of people based on [[weight]]. Usually a heavyweight is a boxer who weighs more than 200 [[Pound (mass)|lbs]] (91kg). Below 200 is [[cruiserweight]]. A few organizations classify differently. In the late 20th century boxing [[organization]]s created many divisions so that fighters could fight people of the same size. This allows making more champions thus more profit. Most divisions only separate each other by few lbs. Before the [[1960s]] there were 8 divisions. 
 
 The first heavyweight champion under modern rules was [[John L. Sullivan]]. Famous heavyweight champions have included [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Joe Louis]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Larry Holmes]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Vitali Klitshko]], [[Tyson Fury]] and [[Lennox Lewis]].
