 {{Wiktionary}} 
 A '''bomb''' is an [[explosive]] object that makes and lets out its energy very quickly. This [[detonation]] makes a big [[shock wave]]. Bombs have been used for [[century|centuries]]. Some bombs also throw out dangerous metal fragments, and some are [[firebomb]]s.  
 
 Most bombs do not contain more energy than ordinary [[fuel]], except in the case of a [[nuclear weapon]]. However, they release their energy more quickly, thus are more [[Power (physics)|powerful]]. 
 
 A bomb is usually some kind of [[container]] filled with [[explosive material]] that is designed to destroy things.  The word bomb comes from the [[Greek language|Greek word]] ''βόμβος'' (bombas), an [[wikt:onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] term with almost the same meaning as  " boom "  in English. 
 
 [[Air force]]s send [[bomber]]s to destroy [[enemy]] [[wikt:target|targets]]. [[Terrorist]]s use bombs in [[suicide attack]]s. Explosive materials used in [[mining]] work the same way, but are usually not called bombs.
