 The word is often used to describe Indian [[cinema]] as a whole, but more precisely it means [[Hindi]] language movies only. The term ''Bollywood'' combines [[Bombay]] (where most Hindi movies are made) and [[Hollywood]] (where most [[United States|American]] movies are made).

 Bollywood makes many movies each year. Many Bollywood movies are called ''Masala'' movies. In Hindi, ''Masala'' means [[spice]]. These movies usually have higher levels of emotions, songs, revenge and differences between rich and poor in them. 
 
 ==Languages used in Bollywood movies== 
 The movies made in Bollywood are usually in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. Some are made in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], which is the [[first language|main]] and [[official language]] of the [[States of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]], where Bollywood is located. Some are also in [[English language|English]].  Often, [[poem|poetic]] Urdu words are used; see also [[Lollywood]] (Pakistan Cinema). 
 
 The number of [[dialogue]]s and [[song]]s in English has increased lately. There are movies now where parts of the dialogue are in English. There is also a growing number of movies which are in English. Some movies are also made in more than one language. This is either done with [[subtitle]]s, or by using several [[soundtrack]]s. 
 
 == What Bollywood movies are like == 
 In general, Bollywood movies are like [[musical]]s. The [[audience]] expects to hear music. There are usually song-and-[[dance]] numbers as a part of the script. Often, the success of a movie depends on the quality of these musical numbers. < ref > Kalita, S. Mitra (2005). Suburban Sahibs: Three Immigrant Families And Their Passage from India to America. Rutgers University Press, p. 134. {{ISBN|0-8135-3318-X}} < /ref >  Very often, the movie music is released before the movie. It helps make the audience bigger. 
 
 A good [[entertainer]] is generally referred to as ''paisa vasool''. This means ''money's worth''. Songs and dances, [[Intimate relationship|love triangles]], [[comedy]] and [[thrill]]s are all mixed up. Such movies are called ''[[masala]]'' movies, after the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word for a [[spice]] mixture, ''masala''. Like ''masalas'', these movies are a mixture of many things. 
 
 Bollywood movies are often longer than those made in Hollywood. A normal Bollywood movie is about 3 hours long. Bollywood movies are movies made for the masses. Other Indian movies are made inside or outside of the Bollywood [[tradition]]. They sometimes try to set higher [[standard]]s. They often lose out at the [[box office]] to movies with more mass appeal. 
 
 Bollywood [[plot]]s are usually [[melodrama]]tic. They often use common ideas such as star-crossed lovers and angry parents, love triangles, family ties, [[wikt:sacrifice|sacrifice]], [[corruption|corrupt]] [[politician]]s, kidnappers, scheming [[villain]]s, [[hooker]]s with a heart of gold, long-lost relatives and [[sibling]]s separated by fate, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences. 
 
 Bollywood songs are called Hindi film songs or filmi songs. Most of the movies have songs in them. Bollywood songs along with dances are a [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]] part of Hindi cinema. They give these movies their popular appeal, [[culture|cultural]] value and [[context]]. Songs are sung by [[playback singer]]s which actors and actresses [[lip sync]] on screen. 
 
 == Change == 
 Bollywood ways of doing things are changing, however. A large Indian [[diaspora]] in English-speaking countries, and increased [[Western culture|Western]] [[influence]] at home, have moved Bollywood movies closer to movies made in Hollywood. [[Kiss]]es in the movies are now allowed. Plots tend to show [[Western civilization|Westernised]] city people dating and dancing in [[disco]]s instead of [[arranged marriage]]s. 
 
 Movie [[critic]] Lata Khubchandani writes, " ''..our earliest movies...(had) liberal doses of sex and kissing scenes in them. Strangely, it was after Independence the censor board came into being and so did all the strictures.'' " < ref > Free Reeling, PLAY, Sunday Mid-day, March 11, 2007, Mumbai.MH/MR/WEST/66/2006-08 {{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/smd/play/2007/march/153266.htm|title=Memories of another day|publisher=mid-day.com|first=Lata|last=Khubchandani}} < /ref > 
 In 2001 five percent on Indian movies were shown in the [[United Kingdom]] which has a large Indian [[minority]]. 
 
 The emergence of streaming media and OTT platforms has disrupted the Bollywood industry as well. With [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]] affecting the entertainment industry worldwide, focus has shifted in recent year from cinema to web series. A number of successful web series are produced in Bollywood and overall the trend is shifting from musical films to different genres. This has also given rise to a trend of method acting in Bollywood, which more and more young actors are now taking up. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-06-26|title=Bollywood Method Actors - From Past to the Future|url=https://amitsadhfanclub.com/bollywood-method-actors/|access-date=2021-10-11|website=Amit Sadh Fan Club|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211009172303/https://amitsadhfanclub.com/bollywood-method-actors/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
