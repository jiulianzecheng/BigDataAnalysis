A '''controversy''' is a  prolonged public [[dispute]] or [[debate]], with people having different [[opinion]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/controversy |title=controversy |author= |website= |publisher=Vocabulary.com |accessdate=8 July 2016}} < /ref >  There may be several groups of people who have different opinions and who cannot agree.
