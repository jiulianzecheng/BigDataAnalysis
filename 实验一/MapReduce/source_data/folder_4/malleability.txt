 '''Malleability''' is a substance's ability to deform under pressure (compressive stress). If malleable, a material may be flattened into thin sheets by hammering or rolling. Malleable materials can be flattened into [[metal leaf]]. One well-known type of metal leaf is [[gold leaf]]. Many metals with high malleability also have high [[ductility]].  Some do not; for example [[lead]] has low ductility but high malleability. 
 
 Malleability is a physical property of [[matter]], usually [[metal]]s. The property usually applies to the family groups 1 to 12 on the modern [[periodic table]] of elements. It is the ability of a [[solid]] to bend or be [[hammer]]ed into other shapes without [[:wikt:broken|breaking]].  Examples of malleable metals are [[gold]], [[iron]], [[aluminum]], [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[lead]]. 
 
 [[Gold]] and [[silver]] are highly malleable. When a piece of hot [[iron]] is [[hammer]]ed it takes the shape of a sheet. The property is not seen in non-metals. Non-malleable metals may break apart when struck by a hammer. Malleable metals usually bend and twist in various shapes. 
 
 [[Zinc]] is malleable at temperatures between 100 and 200 & nbsp;°C but is brittle at other temperatures. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/elements/T-Z/Zinc.html|title=Zinc, Chemical Element - reaction, uses, elements, examples, metal, gas, number, name|website=www.chemistryexplained.com|access-date=2019-10-05}} < /ref > 
 
 === How is malleability measured? === 
 There are two ways to measure it. The first is to measure the pressure or compressive stress that a material withstands before it breaks. The other test involves measuring the thickness of a metal sheet before it breaks. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-03-18|title=Explorando la Maleabilidad de los Metales: Guía Completa y Aplicaciones Prácticas|url=https://industrysurfer.com/blog-industrial/metales/maleabilidad-de-los-metales/|access-date=2023-10-25|language=es-MX}} < /ref >
