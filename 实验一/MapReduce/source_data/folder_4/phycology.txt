'''Phycology''' (or '''algology'''), a part of [[botany]], is the study of [[alga]]e. Algae are important as [[primary production|primary producers]] in [[aquatic]] [[ecosystem]]s. Most algae are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[organism]]s that live in a wet environment. They are different from the higher [[plant]]s by a lack of  " normal "  [[root]]s, stems or [[leaf|leaves]]. Many types have one cell and are very small or [[microscopic]] (including [[phytoplankton|plankton]] and other [[microalgae]]); many others [[multicellular|have many cells]]; some of these are very big, like [[seaweeds]] such as [[kelp]] and ''[[Sargassum]]''. 
 
 Phycology includes the study of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] forms known as blue-green algae or [[cyanobacteria]]. Some microscopic algae are also in [[lichen]]s. 
 
 A '''''phycologist''''' is a person who studies phycology...
