 '''Orogeny''' is the process of [[mountain]]-building. It takes place when two [[tectonic plate]]s come together. Orogens develop while a continental plate is crumpled and thickened to form [[mountain range]]s, and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called '''orogenesis'''. < ref name=Waltham > {{cite book |title=Foundations of engineering geology |author=Tony Waltham |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGtIHJTXaI4C & pg=PA20 |isbn=978-0415469593 |publisher=Taylor  &  Francis |year=2009 |edition=3rd}} < /ref > < ref name=Vine > {{cite book |title=Global tectonics |author=Philip Kearey, Keith A.

 A [[convergent boundary]] is a frequent cause: 
 *Where a continent rides over an oceanic plate (non-collisional):  
 ** [[Andes]] in [[South America]] 
 *Where two continental plates converge (collide): 
 ** [[Alps]] 
 ** [[Himalayas]]  
 Another, less common cause is when a plate moves over a [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] in the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Examples: 
 *[[Hawaii]]an chain of islands 
 *[[Yellowstone National Park]] 
 There is a third process, called ''delamination''. Here an unstable portion of cold root of the [[lithosphere]] drips down into the mantle, decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift. Example: 
 * The [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] in California. 
 Areas that are [[Rift (geology)|rift]]ing apart, such as [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and the East African Rift have mountains due to thermal [[buoyancy]] caused by the hot mantle underneath them, which pushes them up. This thermal buoyancy is known as ''dynamic topography''. Examples: 
 * [[Iceland]] ([[Mid-ocean ridge|Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]). 
 * [[East Africa]]n [[Great Rift Valley|Rift]] 
 
 *[[Variscan orogeny]]: older mountain belts caused by the formation of [[Pangaea]].
