 ==Geography== 
 There are two Illogan parishes: 
 * '''St Illogan Church Parish''' stretching from Piece and Carnkie, to Portreath on the North Coast; Brea and Tuckingmill along the River Connor to the West; and Porthtowan, Sparnon Gate and Redruth Coombe to the East. The population is approximately 14,000; making it more populous than Redruth. It was the third largest in Cornwall. Before 1935, the church and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] boundaries were the same.  
 * '''Illogan Civil Parish''' stretching from Bridge and Harris Mill in the East; Tolvaddon and Bell Lake in the West; and from the [[A30 road (England)|A30]] to Reskajeage on the North Cliffs. In 1985, civil parish status was given back to Illogan, but as the population was too large, Illogan was divided into the civil parishes of Carn Brea, Illogan and Portreath.
