A '''pipeline''' is a long tube, that is used to transport [[liquid]]s or [[gas]]es over long distances. Pipelines are made of [[metal]]. While the transport of liquids and gases is common, some pipelines are used to transport [[coal]] or [[iron ore]], which are mixed with [[mud]]. Such pipelines are sometimes called slurry pipelines. Even though a pipeline is very expensive to build, the low operating cost often makes it the cheapest transport.  
 
 Many [[stadium]]s use a central [[wikt:tank|tank]] for [[beer]]. Each bar is served by a pipeline from the central tank. 
 
 Even though [[mail]] and other goods can also be delivered that way, the system is generally not referred to as ''pipeline''. In this case, [[capsule]]s are used. These are [[pneumatics|propelled by air]]. 
 
 ==Technology== 
 Pipeline networks are made of different components. These are: 
 *The supply station is where the pipeline starts. Very often, there are  tanks that act as a buffer 
 *There are several pumps and compressors, which move the product through the pipeline. 
 *Partial delivery stations allow to deliver part of the product 
 *Block valve stations use [[valve]]s to isolate the pipeline into independent segments. 
 *Regulator stations are used to release some of the [[pressure]] 
 *The final delivery station is where the product is delivered to the consumer. Very often tanks are used as a buffer.
