 A '''speedometer''' is a type of [[gauge]] that shows the [[speed]] a [[vehicle]] is moving.  It usually shows the speed in [[miles per hour]] (mph) for countries that use the [[statute mile]] for distances or [[Kilometres per hour]] (kph) for countries that use the [[metric system]]. Originally, a speedometer was an [[wikt:option|option]] that car owners could buy to put on their car. Beginning about 1910 it was built into all cars. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/speedometer.htm|title=How Speedometers Work|author=William Harris|website= |publisher=HowStuffWorks/InfoSpace LLC|accessdate=10 September 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 The [[electric]] speedometer was [[invented]] by the [[Croatia]]n [[Josip Belušić]] < ref > {{cite book| last = Sobey| first = Ed| title = A Field Guide to Automotive Technology| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7GMrH4nRhcAC & pg=PA78| accessdate = 30 January 2015| year = 2009| publisher = Chicago Review Press| isbn = 978-1-55652-812-5| page = 78 }} < /ref >  in 1888, and was originally called a velocimeter. [[Charles Babbage]] is credited with creating an early type of a speedometer. These were usually fitted to [[locomotive]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/newmyths.com/nmwebsite/non_fiction/charles-babbage-and-the-difference-engine|title=Charles Babbage and the Difference Engine - NewMyths.com|work=google.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://udini.proquest.com/topic/charles-babbage/|title=Udini → Flow|work=proquest.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 A speedometer was [[patent]]ed by a [[Germany|German]], [[Otto Schulze]] on October 7, 1902, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://w1.siemens.com/press/en/pp_cc/2005/04_apr/sosep200501_10_(special200504)_1264810.htm |title=Speedometer |publisher=Siemens |date=26 April 2005 |accessdate=30 January 2015 |archive-date=28 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228112741/http://w1.siemens.com/press/en/pp_cc/2005/04_apr/sosep200501_10_(special200504)_1264810.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  it uses a [[Rotation|rotating]] flexible [[cable]] usually driven by [[gear]]ing linked to the output of the vehicle's [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. The early [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and many [[motorcycle]]s, however, use a cable driven from a front wheel. 
 
 == Speedometer accuracy == 
 Most speedometers have [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]] of some ±10%, mainly due to [[wikt:variation|variation]]s in [[tire]] [[diameter]]. < ref name= " FxM " > {{cite web |url=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/ask-the-experts-speedometers-and-speed-cameras-20120411-1wsqp.html|title=Ask the experts: Speedometers and speed cameras|author= |date=13 August 2012 |website= |publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=10 September 2015}} < /ref >  Sources of error due to tire diameter variations are wear, temperature, pressure, vehicle load, and nominal tire size. Vehicle manufacturers usually calibrate speedometers to show the vehicle is going faster. < ref name=FxM/ > 
 
 === Underinflation === 
 When a tire has less air pressure than it should, it is underinflated. Underinflation causes excessive heat and reduces the diameter of the tires. < ref name= " MarkusC & D " > {{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/speedometer-scandal|title=Speedometer Scandal! |author=Frank Markus|date=April 2002 |website= |publisher=Car and Driver/Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=10 September 2015}} < /ref >  This causes it to rotate faster than the speedometer shows it is. Tires underinflated by only 10 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] can mean a car or truck reading 70 & nbsp;mph on the speedometer is actually traveling at 72 & nbsp;mph. < ref name=MarkusC & D/ >
