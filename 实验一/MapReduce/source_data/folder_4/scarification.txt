 '''Scarification''' or '''cicatrization''' is a form of [[body modification]], where a design or pattern is cut, [[wikt:etch|etched]] or [[wikt:scratch|scratched]] into human [[skin]] to make a permanent scar. Like with most body modification, there are many reasons why people choose to be scarified. The act of scarifying has been compared to [[tattoo]]ing due to the fact that it permanently changes the skin. It has also been identified with [[self harm]] because people have used it to cover self-inflicted [[wikt:wound|wounds]]. < ref > {{cite web|date=2010-12-05|title=Bizarre Magazine: Self Harm Cover-ups|url=http://www.bizarremag.com/weird-news/tattoos-body-art/7164/self_harm_coverups.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426041459/http://www.bizarremag.com/weird-news/tattoos-body-art/7164/self_harm_coverups.html|archive-date=2009-04-26|work=Shannon Larratt|accessdate=2008-06-01}} < /ref > 
 
 Scarification began as [[cultural identity|cultural identification]] in some places, especially in [[MƒÅori people|Maori]] and [[Africa]]n societies. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/07/0728_040728_tvtabooscars.html|work=Sharon Guynup|date=2010-12-05|accessdate=2004-07-28 |title=National Geographic: Scarification: Ancient Body Art Leaving New Marks}} < /ref >  Other cultures may use it for religious reasons, and nearly all cultures use it for [[aesthetics]]. Some people also use scarification for pleasure, as the process of being scarified creates [[endorphin]]s.
