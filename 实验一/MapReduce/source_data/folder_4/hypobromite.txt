 '''Hypobromite''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is BrO < sup > - < /sup > . It contains [[bromine]] in its +1 [[oxidation state]]. It is an [[oxidizing agent]]. It is similar to [[hypochlorite]]. Hypobromites are the [[salt]]s of [[hypobromous acid]]. Hypobromite is a [[disinfectant]]. Some [[white blood cell]]s [[oxidation|oxidize]] [[bromide]] to hypobromite with [[peroxide]] and use the hypobromite to kill germs. Bromides can be added to pools along with chlorine to make hypobromite, which disinfects the pools. 
 
 Hypobromites are made by dissolving bromine in a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] solution. Hypobromite [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to [[bromate]] and bromide when heated.
