Predestination is a [[religion|religious]] concept, which is about the relationship between [[God]] and His [[creation]]. The religious character of predestination distinguishes it from other ideas about [[determinism]] and [[free will]]. Those who believe in predestination, such as [[John Calvin]], believe that before the [[Creation myth|creation]] God determined the destiny of the universe throughout all of time and space. They believe that God orders some people to Heaven, and all other people will go to Hell because of their [[sin]]s. This is determined before they even are born. 
 
 Definition: predestination is the divine foreordaining or foreknowledge of all that will happen. It applies to the [[salvation]] of some and not others. It has been particularly associated with the teachings of [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] and of [[John Calvin]].
