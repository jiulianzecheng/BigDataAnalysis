A '''song''' is a piece of [[music]] which contains lyrics and words. Songs may be made by [[Songwriter|songwriters]]. Other songs are [[Folk music|folk song]]s, which are songs created by people long ago that have been sung as [[Custom|tradition]]. 
 
 Some people form [[band]]s which write and record songs to make [[money]] from it. When two or three singers sing the song it is called a [[duet]] or [[Trio (music)|trio]]. Some people also make [[parody|parodies]] of songs, which is usually changing the words of the song but keeping the tune. Parodies are usually made to make fun of a song or its writer/singer (parody artist [[ " Weird Al "  Yankovic]] is an example of this). 
 
 The word  " song "  is often used to describe any piece of music, even one without words or lyrics. The proper word for a piece of music without words is  " ''[[instrumental]]'' " .
