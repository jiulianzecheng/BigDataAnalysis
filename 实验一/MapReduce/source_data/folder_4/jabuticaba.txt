 '''Jabuticaba''' (''Plinia cauliflora''), also known as '''Brazilian grapetree''' or '''jaboticaba''', is a tree in the family Myrtaceae, native to [[Brazil]]. It is unusual in that it appears to blossom right out of the bark and trunk of its tree. The tree may even look covered in purple warts or pimples when it is fully in season. It is often used in its native lands in [[South America]] much like [[grape]]s are used elsewhere. 
 
 Jabuticaba fruit looks like thick-skinned deep-purple grapes. Inside the pink or white sweet fleshy fruit. Embedded in the pulpy flesh are several large seeds. The fruit is typically eaten fresh or made into tarts, [[jam]]s or [[wine]]s and liqueurs.
