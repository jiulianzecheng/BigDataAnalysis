 '''''Dilophosaurus''''' (meaning 'double-crested lizard') was a medium-large [[dinosaur]] from 190 [[million]] years ago. 
 
 ''Dilophosaurus'' has been examined several times over the years and has been put into no less than nine different theropod groups. It may be related to the smaller ''[[Coelophysis]]''. Specific details of its life-style are few. Some of its fossils were found in [[terrain]] which was a low-lying slow-moving river system at the time. < ref > Harshbarger J.W; Repenning C.A.  &  Irwin J.H. 1957. ''Stratigraphy of the uppermost Triassic and the Jurassic rocks of the Navajo country''. Professional Paper 291. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Geological Survey. < /ref >  The animal was obviously a [[carnivore]]. 
 
 ''Dilophosaurus'' was shown in the [[movie]]s, ''[[Jurassic Park (movie)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Jurassic World Dominion]]'' and ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]''.
