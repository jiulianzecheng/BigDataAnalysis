 A '''passerine''' is a [[bird]] of the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Passeriformes''', which includes more than half of all bird species. They are [[wikt:perch|perching]] birds. Most of them are small in size, and most can sing very well. Their main [[suborder]] is the Passeri, the [[songbirds]]. < ref > Sibley C.G.  &  Monroe B.L. Jr. 1990. ''Distribution and taxonomy of the birds of the World''. Yale Univ. Press, New Haven CT. < /ref > 
 
 == Adaptations == 
 The passerines have a number of [[adaptations]] which, taken together, have made them highly successful, with many species around the world. 
 
 #Perching. All passerines have four toes on each foot. Three of the toes point forwards. The other toe points backwards. This means that passerines can easily hold onto trees or rocks. Because of this, they are also known as '''perching birds'''.  A [[tendon]] in the rear of the leg makes the foot curl and grip when the bird lands on a branch. This is more than just a convenience for the birds: it is a ''tendon locking mechanism'' so they can sleep without falling off. < ref > Stefoff, Rebecca (2008), ''The Bird Class'', Marshall Cavendish Benchmark < /ref > < ref > Brooke, Michael  &  Birkhead, Tim 1991. ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Ornithology''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521362059}} < /ref > < ref > It works by one tendon running down the leg shifting position slightly so it grips the tendon which closes the toes. Bats independently evolved a similar arrangement. Quinn T.H.  &  Baumel J.J. 1990. Chiropteran locking mechanisms: the passive digital lock. ''J. Morphology''. '''109''', 281{{ndash}}208.  < /ref > 
 #All passerine chicks are born in an undeveloped state ([[altricial]]): they need parental help. Their eyes are closed, and they are bald, with little or no [[Feather|down]]. They cannot leave the nest, and must be fed by the parents. The advantage of this is that their brains grow larger during the fledgling stage. In birds which leave the nest early, their brains depend mainly on material in the egg. Passerines have significantly large brains compared to body size, and many passerines are comparatively intelligent. < ref > Paul R. Ehrlich, David S. Dobkin, and Darryl Wheye 1988. [http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Precocial_and_Altricial.html Precocial and altricial young]. < /ref > 
 #The use of song for [[communication]]. This is the most obvious adaptation. 
 #Almost all passerines have 12 tail [[feather]]s. < ref > The [[superb lyrebird]] has 16. Jones D. 2008. Flight of fancy. ''Australian Geographic,'' '''89''', 18–19. < /ref >  This is a [[basal]] [[Trait (biology)|trait]], a feature inherited from their past. It leads biologists to think this large group originally had one common ancestor. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 Evidence on their [[evolution]] comes from [[comparative anatomy]], the [[fossil]] record and [[molecular biology]].  
 
 It is thought that the first passerines evolved in the southern continent of [[Gondwana]] in the [[Palaeogene]]. This might have taken place around the Upper [[Palaeocene]] some 60–55 mya. < ref > Barker, F. Keith ''et al'' 2004: Phylogeny and diversification of the largest avian radiation.

 The early fossil record is poor because the first Passeriformes were on the small side, and their delicate bones did not preserve well. Two specimens from [[Queensland, Australia]] are fossil bone fragments clearly recognizable as passeriform. They are two species of about 10 and 20 & nbsp;cm in overall length. This proves that some 55 & nbsp;mya, barely into the early [[Eocene]], early perching birds were recognizably distinct. < ref > Boles, Walter E. 1997. Fossil songbirds (Passeriformes) from the early Eocene of Australia. ''Emu''. '''97''' (1): 43-50. {{doi|10.1071/MU97004}} < /ref >  It also suggests that the origin of this great order of birds was in the southern continent. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 [[File:Pardalotus with nesting material.jpg|thumb|right|Striated pardalote (''Pardalotus striatus'') with nesting material]] 
 
 There are three [[taxonomy|sub-orders]]: ''Acanthisitti'', ''[[Tyranni]]'' and ''[[Passeri]]''. There are only two bird [[species]] in the sub-order Acanthisitti. They are known as [[New Zealand]] wrens. The sub-order Tyranni are also known as the '''suboscines'''. Many of these birds are found in [[tropical]] areas. The sub-order Passeri has the most bird species. They are also known as the '''oscines'''.
