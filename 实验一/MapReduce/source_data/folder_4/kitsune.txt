 {{nihongo|'''Kitsune'''|狐||extra={{IPA2|kitsɯne}}}} ({{audio|Ja-Kitsune.oga|pronunciation}}) is the Japanese word for [[fox]].  There are a lot of foxes in [[Japanese folklore]]. Stories depict them as intelligent beings and as having [[magic|magical]] abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. The most important of their magic tricks is the ability to [[shapeshifting|assume human form]]. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others — as foxes in folklore often do — others portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives. 
 
 Foxes and human beings lived close together in [[history of Japan|ancient Japan]]; this is why there are legends about them. Kitsune have become closely associated with [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]], a [[Shinto]] ''[[kami]]'' or spirit, and serve as his messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural importance. The more tails a kitsune has — they may have as many as nine — the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make [[sacrifice|offerings]] to them as to a god.
