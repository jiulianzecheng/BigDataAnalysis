 The '''okapi''' (''Okapia johnstoni'') is an [[even-toed ungulate]] [[mammal]] from central [[Africa]]. With the [[giraffe]] they form the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Giraffidae]]. 
 
 == Appearance == 
 The okapi has a reddish brown body, a whitish gray face, and white and black stripes on its legs. The okapi has a few features that show its link to giraffes. Its height is not as large as giraffes. 
 
 == Life == 
 Okapis live in the [[rainforest]]s of central [[Africa]], in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. 
 
 They are mostly active during the day. Okapis eat mostly [[leaf|leaves]] and buds from [[tree]]s, but also [[grass]], [[fern]]s, [[fruit]], and [[fungus|fungi]]. 
 
 Okapis usually live alone. After 420 to 450 days of [[pregnancy]] the mother gives birth to one baby okapi, which drinks milk for up to 6 months. Okapis become mature when they are 4-5 years old. In captivity, okapis can live for 30 years or so. 
 
 == Other information == 
 The okapi was unknown and a mystery to western researchers for a long time. In the past, scientists thought that the okapi was a mix between the [[giraffe]] and the [[zebra]]. 
 
 The ''International Society for [[Cryptozoology]]'' uses the okapi as its [[symbol]], because the okapi was unknown for a long time.
