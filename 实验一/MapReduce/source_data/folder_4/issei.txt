{{nihongo|'''Issei'''|一世||literally,  " first generation " }} is a [[Japanese language]] term used in countries in [[North America]] and [[South America]] to name the [[Japan]]ese people who [[immigration|immigrated]]. The [[emigration|emigrants]] or [[immigration|immigrants]] who were born in Japan are called ''Issei''; and their children born in the new country are called ''[[Nisei]]'' (second generation).  The [[wikt:grandchild|grandchildren]] of ''Issei'' are called ''[[Sansei]]'' (third generation). < ref > The generation names come from the numbers  " one, two, three "  in the [[Japanese language]].  The first three Japanese numbers are  " ''ichi, ni, san''. The fourth number is  " ''yon'' " . < /ref >

 In the 1930s, the term ''Issei'' came into common use.  The word replaced the term  " immigrant "  (''ijusha'').  This change in usage mirrored an evolution in the way the ''Issei'' looked at themselves.  The label ''Issei'' also included the idea of belonging to the new country. < ref name= " mclellan36 " / >   Other terns like ''Nisei'' were modeled after this ''Issei'' [[pattern]] or [[template]]. 
 
 == Cultural profile == 
 The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was created by sociologists in the late 20th century.  The ''Nikkei'' include all of the world's Japanese immigrants and their descendants. < ref > Japanese American National Museum, [http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/  " What is Nikkei? " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503113652/http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ |date=2009-05-03 }}; retrieved 2012-11-25. < /ref > 
 
 The ''Issei'' were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice. < ref > Smithsonian, [http://americanart.si.edu/pr/library/2010/gaman/gaman_wall_text.pdf   " The Art of Gaman: Arts and Crafts from the Japanese American Internment Camps, 1942 - 1946 " , Yoshitsuchi Ikemoto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225085007/http://americanart.si.edu/pr/library/2010/gaman/gaman_wall_text.pdf |date=2013-02-25 }}; excerpt,  " ... one of hundreds of ''Issei'' (first-generation) 'bachelor' laborers who were unable to send for their wives or a picture bride because the U.S. government cut off all immigration from Japan in 1924 " ; retrieved 2012-11-25. < /ref >   Their children, grandchildren, [[wikt:great-grandchild|great-grandchildren]] and great-great-grandchildren grew up with a national and cultural point-of-view that was different from their parents. 
 
 Although the ''Issei'' kept an emotional connection with Japan, they created homes in a country far from Japan. < ref > Yenne, Bill. (2007).
