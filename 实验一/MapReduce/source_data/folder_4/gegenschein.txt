 The '''Gegenshein''', also called '''Counterglow''', is a very faint [[light]] which can be seen in the sky at night. The light can be seen at the point in the sky that is exactly opposite of the [[Sun]]. It is very hard to see. The light can only be seen from areas with no other lights (away from [[city|cities]]) and on nights with no [[moon]]. This effect is caused by [[matter]] spread around that [[reflection|reflect]] the light from the Sun, and is related to the [[zodiacal light]].
