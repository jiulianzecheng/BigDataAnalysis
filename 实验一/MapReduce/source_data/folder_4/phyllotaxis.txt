 '''Phylotaxy''' or '''phylotaxis''' is the mode of arrangement of leaves on the [[plant stem|stem]] of a plant (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{transl|grc|phýllon}}  " leaf "  and {{transl|grc|táxis}}  " arrangement " ). 
 
 Phyllotaxy has a function: it avoids over-crowding of leaves, and exposes the leaves to the most sunlight for [[photosynthesis]]. The four main types of phyllotaxy are alternate, opposite, ternate and whorled.
