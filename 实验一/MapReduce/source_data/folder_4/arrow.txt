 An '''arrow''' is a [[projectile]] fired with a '''[[bow (weapon)|bow]]'''. A bow and arrow is a [[weapon]] used before [[medieval]] times and later.  For thousands of years, people all over the world have used bows and arrows for hunting and for [[defense (military)|defense]].  Arrows have a sharp point at one end and usually a flight at the other end. The [[flight]] is usually made of feathers and helps the arrow go through the [[air]] straight. Someone who makes arrows is a '''fletcher'''.
