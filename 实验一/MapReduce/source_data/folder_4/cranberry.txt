 A '''cranberry''' is a fruit. It grows on an [[evergreen]] dwarf [[shrub]]. Cranberries are in the [[genus]] ''[[Vaccinium]]'', and its subgenus ''Oxycoccus''. In some classification methods, they are regarded as a genus in their own right. 
 
 Cranberry plants grow in acidic [[bog]]s in cooler areas of the [[northern hemisphere]].  They are low creeping shrubs up to seven feet (3 m) long, from two to eight inches (5-20 cm) high.  They have slender and wiry stems with small leaves which are evergreen with dark pink [[flower]]s. Cranberries are usually eaten during [[Thanksgiving]] in the United States. They are also eaten in [[Europe]] and some parts of [[South America]].   
 
 Cranberries are strong [[cash crop]] < nowiki/ > s for certain [[U.S. state]]s.  They are turned into [[juice]], [[sauce]] or [[jam]]. Since 2000, cranberries have been marketed as superfruit due to their [[antioxidant]] and [[nutrient]] qualities.
