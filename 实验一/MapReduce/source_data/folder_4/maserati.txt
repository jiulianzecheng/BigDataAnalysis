'''Maserati''' is an Italian [[luxury car]] making company. It began working with the company known as [[Ferrari]], but recently changed to a group that includes [[Alfa Romeo]]. The Maserati brothers were named [[Alfieri Maserati|Alfieri]], [[Bindo Maserati|Bindo]], [[Carlo Maserati|Carlo]], [[Ettore Maserati|Ettore]], and [[Ernesto Maserati|Ernesto]]. Alfieri initially raced with cars from a company called [[Diatto]], but in 1926 when they stopped being produced, Alfieri and his brothers created a company called Maserati. One of the first cars that they made (driven by Alfieri) won the 1926 [[Targa Florio]]. Alfieri died in 1932, but the three other brothers continued making the cars. Their trident [[logo]] was probably created by an artist named Mario. 
 
 Maserati also ran a Formula One racing team between 1950 and 1957, employing numerous drivers, including the five-time drivers' champion [[Juan Manuel Fangio]].
