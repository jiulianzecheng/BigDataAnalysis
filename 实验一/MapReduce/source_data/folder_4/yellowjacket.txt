 The '''yellowjacket''' (or '''yellow jacket''') is a [[wasp]] from the [[genera]] ''[[Vespula]]'' and ''Dolichovespula''. In some [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, they are called wasps. Most are black and yellow. Some are black and white. 
 
 Yellowjackets are sometimes confused with bees because they have rather similar colouring. < ref > {{cite web|title=Yellow Jackets|publisher=Mother Earth News|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/pest-control/benefits-of-wasps-yellow-jackets-zw0z1303zkin|access-date=February 17, 2017}} < /ref >  Yellowjackets have a stinger with a small barb. They may sting repeatedly. 
 
 The [[diet]] of an adult yellowjacket is usually [[sugar]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s. They are important predators of other insects because they feed their larvae (grubs) with chewed-up insects. 
 
 They are [[native (ecology)|native to]] [[North America]] and parts of [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].
