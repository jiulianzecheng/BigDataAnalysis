 '''Redonda''' is a very small [[Caribbean]] [[island]].  It is part of [[Antigua and Barbuda]],. < ref > [http://www.ab.gov.ag Government of Antigua and Barbuda Constitution] < /ref >   No people live here. 
 
 This small island is {{convert|56.2|km|mi}} southwest of [[Antigua]].  It is between the islands of [[Nevis]] and [[Montserrat]]. 
 
 Redonda seems like one very large rock. It is what is left of an ancient volcanic core.  The land rises very steeply from sea level, mostly as sheer cliffs. There is no source of freshwater except rain. The only animals that live here are seabirds and a herd of feral goats.  The goats live on the poor grazing on top of the island. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Redonda Day.JPG|upright|thumb|right|The island of Redonda as seen from [[Nevis]] with [[Montserrat]] faintly visible in the distance.]] 
 [[Christopher Columbus]] found Redonda in 1493 on his second journey. He said the island belonged to [[Spain]]. He named the island ''Santa Mar√≠a la Redonda'', meaning Saint Mary the Round.  The island looks round when viewed from the side. In the 1860s, the island became a [[Great Britain|British]] possession.
