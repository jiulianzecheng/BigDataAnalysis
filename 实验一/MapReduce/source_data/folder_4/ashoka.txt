His name means  " without sorrow " . 
 
 Ashoka is often cited as one of South Asia's greatest emperors. After a number of military conquests, he reigned over much of present-day India, and Eastern Pakistan. He fought a war with the kingdom of [[Kalinga]] in which there was said to be 200,000+ casualties. He conquered Kalinga (present-day Odisha) around 261 BCE. 
 
 Afterwards, shaken by his brutal victory, he decided to become a [[Buddhist]] and lead with peace, not war. To do this, he set up hospitals for animals and humans, created shaded and rested areas along roads for weary travelers to rest, and dug wells in villages. We know these things about his life through various inscriptions (writing) on rocks and pillars. Ashoka also convinced people to follow Buddhists paths. 
 
 The national emblem of India and the  " Ashok Chakra "  are created by Ashoka. It's in the flag to keep a remembrance of him.
