'''Molars''' are special [[tooth|teeth]] found in [[mammal]]s, and also the most complex sort of teeth. They are used for [[grind]]ing [[food]].  
 
 Humans have 12 molars in total, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. The molar which is the farthest back in each group is called a wisdom tooth. The wisdom teeth are the last teeth to appear, usually at around the age of eighteen. These final molars do not erupt in many people. 
 
 All molars and [[premolar]]s have a structure for grinding food. They have elevated (~pointed) parts called '''cusps'''. These cusps are characteristics of the species in question, but in general they are found on the molars, and to a lesser extent on premolars.
