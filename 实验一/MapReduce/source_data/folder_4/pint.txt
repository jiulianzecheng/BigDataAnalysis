The '''pint''' (abbreviated '''pt''') is a unit of volume in [[imperial units]] and [[United States customary units]]. There are three types of pints used in different countries. An imperial pint and US pint both equal {{frac|1|2|}} of a quart and {{frac|1|8|}} of a gallon. 
 
 An imperial fluid ounce is approximately 4% smaller than a US fluid ounce although an imperial pint has 4 more fluid ounces than a US pint, making an imperial pint approximately 20% larger than a US pint. 
 
 ==Imperial Pint== 
 The imperial pint is the pint used in [[England]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Burma]]. The unit may appear in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Confusion in Canada often arises as liquids are occasionally sold in U.S. pints, near the border, although the official and only pint that is legal in Canada is the imperial pint. The imperial system has no dry pint and volume in dry units, since solid objects are measured by mass. 1 imperial pint equals 568,261.25 & nbsp;mm < sup > 3 < /sup > .

 ==US Wet Pint== 
 The US wet pint, or more commonly 'pint', is the unit used to measure volume in the [[United States]]. It is more common than the dry pint which is used for non-liquid volume measurements. 1 US pint is exactly equal to 473,176.473 & nbsp;mm < sup > 3 < /sup > , defined by the international yard and pound agreement.

 ==Usage== 
 * The wet U.S. pint is still commonly used in the United States. 
 * In Canada, it is commonly used for alcohol although a pint can vary from 12 fl oz to 20 fl oz and is sometimes incorrectly given in US fl oz. 
 * In England and Ireland, only milk and pure ethanol are sold in pints; however, milk must have litres next to pints. 
 * In England, milk is often sold in metric quantities near to imperial pints.
