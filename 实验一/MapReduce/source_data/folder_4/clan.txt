 A '''clan''' is a group of people who  & ndash; following a tradition  & ndash; belong to the same [[kin]]. The word comes from the [[Goidelic languages]], and means 'family'. It is similar in meaning to the more general word [[tribe]]. 
 
 In Europe, the best-known clans system is that in [[Scotland]], which still has some effects today, especially in the Scottish [[Highlands and Islands]]. It existed before the land was unified under a Scottish king, and continued long afterwards. Clans also 
 existed in [[Ireland]].
