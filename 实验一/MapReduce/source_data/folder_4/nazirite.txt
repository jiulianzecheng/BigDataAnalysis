In the [[Bible]], a '''Nazarite''' is a person who follows certain rules from [[God]]. Someone becomes a Nazarite by making certain vows, or promises to the Lord. Nazarites must not eat anything made from [[grapes]], including [[wine]], nor get a [[haircut]]. The word comes from the Hebrew word nazir meaning  " consecrated "  or  " separated " .
