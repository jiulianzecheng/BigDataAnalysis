 '''Reproduction''' is to create or recreate something, (usually) a new living thing, such as a [[baby]]. In [[biology]], the two types of reproduction are [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] and [[asexual reproduction]]. Sexual reproduction involves two [[organism]]s of the same [[species]], each supplying half the [[gene]]s for the descendant. Asexual reproduction only involves a single organism; it works by division (or splitting) of the [[cell]]. Most [[bacteria]] reproduce by asexual reproduction. Some organisms can either reproduce sexually or asexually.
