 The '''spleen''' is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] in [[vertebrates]]. The spleen is part of the [[lymphatic system]]. In people, it is on the left side of the body, under the [[heart]]. The spleen helps fight [[infection]]s and keeps the [[blood cells]] healthy. 
 
 == Tasks == 
 The spleen cleans out old blood cells from the [[blood]] and recycles them. It helps save the [[iron]] and the [[amino acids]] from the old blood cells. The spleen also holds a supply of extra blood, in case the body needs some quickly. The spleen works together with the [[circulatory system]] (the system which brings blood to the body). 
 
 A study published in 2009 using mice found that the spleen is a reservoir which holds over half the body's [[monocyte]]s. < ref name= " Swirski " > {{Cite journal|pmid=19644120 |last=Swirski F.K.

 == Shape == 
 The spleen is shaped like a loose fist. It is tucked under the left side of the [[diaphragm]], close by the heart.The average adult spleen weighs 0.44 lbs. 
 
 == Disease == 
 The spleen can get bigger when a person is [[digestion|digesting]] food or is sick. If a person's spleen gets big enough, it can break open. If this happens, the person needs medical care right away. Emergency [[surgery]] might be needed to control the bleeding. 
 
 Some of the diseases that cause the spleen to get bigger are:   
 * [[malaria]],  
 * [[rheumatoid arthritis]],  
 * [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic]] [[lupus]],  
 * [[sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]],  
 * [[leukemia]],  
 * [[lymphoma]], and  
 * [[mononucleosis]] ( " mono " ). 
 
 == Culture == 
 In the past, many people believed the spleen helped control emotions. For example, if a person was upset or angry, people would think it was because of a spleen problem.
