 '''Epithelium''' (plural: epithelia) is one of the four main types of [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] in the body of [[animals]]. It is made up of one or more layers of [[cell]]s.  
 
 The outermost layer of the [[skin]] is a special type of epithelium. It has an important [[Function (biology)|function]]: it forms a mechanical [[wikt:defence|defence]] against [[infection]]: see [[innate immunity]].  
 
 Epithelia are found on the surface of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and many other parts of the body. One main function of epithelia is moving [[liquid|fluids]] into or out of an organ or body part. It also protects organs and carries [[sense organ]]s.  
 
 There are many different types of epithelium that do different things in the body, including the [[excretory]] system. The epithelium covers blood vessels and hollow organs such as the [[stomach]] and kidneys.  All glands are made from epithelial cells. In some areas, the epithelium secretes sweat, oil, or [[mucus]]. 
 
 The functions of epithelial cells include secretion, selective absorption, protection, transcellular transport, and sensing. Epithelial layers have no blood vessels: they get oxygen and nourishment from the underlying [[connective tissue]], through their basement membrane. < ref > Ross M.H.  &  Pawlina W. 2015.
