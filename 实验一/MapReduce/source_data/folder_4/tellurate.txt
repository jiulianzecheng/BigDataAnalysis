'''Tellurate''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is TeO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup >  or TeO < sub > 6 < /sub > < sup > 6- < /sup > . [[Chemical compound]]s having the tellurate ion in them are called '''tellurates'''. Tellurates are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s. They are similar to [[selenate]]s. Tellurates react with [[acid]]s to make [[telluric acid]].  
 
 An example is sodium tellurate (Na < sub > 2 < /sub > TeO < sub > 4 < /sub > ). It is made by reacting [[telluric acid]] with [[sodium hydroxide]]. It can also be made by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] [[sodium tellurite]]. It is similar to [[sodium selenate]].
