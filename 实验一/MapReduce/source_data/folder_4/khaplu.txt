 In the late 14th century, Syed Ali Hamdani came to Khaplu and converted people to [[Islam]] from [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Bon]]. Many [[mosque]]s and [[khanqah]]s attributed to him still exist. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Rieck|first=Andreas|date=1995-01-01|title=The Nurbakhshis of Baltistan — Crisis and Revival of a Five Centuries Old Community|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/wdi/35/2/article-p159_1.xml|journal=Die Welt des Islams|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=159–188|doi=10.1163/1570060952597761|issn=1570-0607}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Khaplu Kingdom|Khaplu]] was once an [[Independence|independent]] kingdom ruled by the [[Yabgo dynasty]], the second-largest in [[Baltiyul]] after the [[Makpon Empire]]. In 1974, the rulers of Khaplu acceded their state to [[Pakistan]], ending their rule of over a thousand years. In the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century|18th]] centuries, Khaplu had strong ties with [[Ladakh]] and [[Makpon Kingdom|Makpon]] (Skardu) due to the marriages between the [[Royal families]]. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Ladakh through the ages: towards a new identity|last1=Kaul|first1=Shridhar|last2=Kaul|first2=Hriday Nath|date=2004|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-85182-75-9|edition=Third|location=New-Delhi}} < /ref > 
 
 Captain Claude Martin Wade was likely the first [[Europe]]an to visit Khaplu in 1835. Other travelers like William Moorcroft, George Trebeck, Godfrey Vigne, Alexander Cunningham, and Thomas Thomson explored and wrote about Khaplu's beauty and [[historical]] significance in the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th]] centuries. < ref > Travels in the Himalayan Provinces of Hindustan and the Punjab in Ladakh and Kashmir in Peshawar, Kabul, Kunduz and Bokhara From 1819 to 1825 (in two volumes)Part II, p 264 < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Jajja|first=Sumaira|date=2014-07-27|title=Khaplu — off the beaten path|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1121859|access-date=2023-12-13|website=DAWN.COM|language=en}} < /ref >
