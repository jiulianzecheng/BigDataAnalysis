 '''Gagra''' ([[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and {{lang-ru|Гагра}}; {{lang-ka|გაგრა}}) is a town in [[Abkhazia]]. It covers an area of about 5 & nbsp;kilometres. It is located on the northeastern coast of the [[Black Sea]], at the base of the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. The moderate climate makes it a popular tourist resort. 
 
 Gagra is the centre of the [[Gagra District]]. It is located in the western part of Abkhazia. The river [[Psou]] serves as a border with [[Krasnodar Kray]] of [[Russia]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Gagra was established as a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[colony]]. During the rule of the Kingdom of [[Colchis]], they called it ''Triglite''. 
 
 In the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the town was renamed to ''Nitica''. Because of its geographical and commercial importance, it was attacked repeatedly by the [[Goths]]. The Romans did not neglect it, however. They [[Fortification|fortified]] it well. After the Romans, the [[Byzantine Empire]] took control of all of Colchis, including ''Nitica''. It became a major trading center for merchants from [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]. The name  " Gagra "  appeared for the first time on a map in 1308. This was on a map of the Caucasus made by the Italian Pietro Visconti. This map is now in the Library of Saint Mark in Venice.

 In the 16th century, Gagra was a part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It was invaded by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Because of poverty and disease, most of its people had left. After Russia's victory over the Ottomans in 1878, Russia rebuilt the town.

 === Gagra under the Soviet Union === 
 In 1919, [[Vladimir Lenin]] established a  " worker's resort "  in Gagra. He [[Nationalization|nationalised]] the resort that had been built by [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]. Then Gagra became a popular holiday resort for Soviet citizens. During [[World War II]], it gained a new role as a site for the [[rehabilitation]] of wounded soldiers. After the war, various state-run [[sanatorium]]s were built there. The resort grew and was developed quickly as part of the  " Soviet Riviera " .

 In the late 1980s, tensions grew between the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] and [[Abkhaz]]ian communities in the region. War started between 1992 and 1993. It ended in a defeat of the Georgian government's forces. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians were forced to leave their homes in Abkhazia. This was part of a mass [[ethnic cleansing]], in which thousands of Georgian civilians were [[massacre]]d. < ref > {{cite book| last = Murphy| first = Paul J.| title = The Wolves of Islam: Russia and the Faces of Chechen Terror| year = 2004| publisher = Potomac Books, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-57488-830-0 }} < /ref > < ref > Human Rights Watch Arms Project.
