 '''Mooning''' is the act of displaying one's bare [[buttocks]], by removing [[clothing]]. Very often, poeple also bend over, and their [[genitals]] may be visible as well. In English-speaking countries, mooning is used to show [[protest]], or disrespect. It can also be done as a form of [[w:provocation|provocation]]. Mooning can be done for shock value, for fun, as a [[joke]] or as a form of [[exhibitionism]]. The [[Māori people|Māori]] have a form of mooning known as '''{{Lang|mi|whakapohane}}''' that is a form of [[insult]].  
 
 In some countries, mooning is seen as a form of [[indecent exposure]]. This often depends on the context.
