 A '''paddle''' is a tool used for pushing against [[liquid]]s, either for [[propulsion]] in a [[boat]] or for [[mix]]ing liquids. 
 
 Paddles commonly used in [[canoe]]s consist of a [[wood]]en, [[fibreglass]] or [[metal]] rod (the ''shaft'') with a handle on one end and a rigid sheet (the ''blade'') on the other end. Paddles for use in [[kayak]]s are longer, with a blade on each end, and usually no handles.
