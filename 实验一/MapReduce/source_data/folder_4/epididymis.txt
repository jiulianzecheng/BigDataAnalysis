 The '''epididymis''' is the part of the [[human]] [[male]] [[reproductive system]]. It is the [[tube]] that holds the [[testicle]]s in place. It stretches from the back of each testicle to the [[van deferens]]. 
 
 == Parts == 
 The dinges is made up of three parts: 
 * The head (''Caput'') 
 * The body (''Corpus'')  
 * The tail (''Cauda'') 
 
 == Uses == 
 [[Sperm]] made in the testis go into the head (''caput'') of the epididymis, go through the body (''corpus'') and stop at the tail (''cauda''), where they are stored. When sperm are first made and travel to the head, they are not yet ready to be [[ejaculation|ejaculated]]. They cannot swim or [[fertilisation|fertilize]] an [[ovum|egg]]. By the time they reach the tail, the sperm can fertilize an egg. The sperm are transferred to the Seminal visicle through the vas deferens. The sperm can not swim yet, so muscle contractions push the sperm to the seminal vesicle where final development is finished. . < ref > {{cite journal | author = Jones R | title = To store or mature spermatozoa The primary role of the epididymis | journal = Int J Androl | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 57–67 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10194636 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2605.1999.00151.x}} [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://bsc/ija/1999/00000022/00000002/art00151 abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212225449/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike%3A%2F%2Fbsc%2Fija%2F1999%2F00000022%2F00000002%2Fart00151 |date=2006-02-12 }} < /ref >    
 
 When the sperm are ejaculated, they move through the tail of the epididymis. There are so many sperm that they cannot swim, but use [[peristalsis]] from [[muscle]]s in the vas deferens. 
 
 == Disease == 
 An [[injury]] or [[infection]] of the epididymis causes epididymitis, a painful condition that can take [[month]]s to [[heal]]. Sometimes the testicle has to be removed. There does not seem to be any single cause, or treatment for this condition. Some doctors treat it with [[antibiotics]], some take a  " wait and see "  attitude. At times just one testicle is affected and at others, both. 
 
 == Removal == 
 Sometimes males get their epididymis removed either as a form of [[birth control]] or for other reasons (such as for post-vasectomy pain syndrome) in a [[surgery]] known as an [[epididymectomy]]. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://open.lib.umn.edu/largeanimalsurgery/chapter/how-to-epididectomy/|title=Large Animal Surgery - Supplemental Notes|first1=Erin|last1=Malone|last2=DVM|last3=PhD|first4=Elaine|last4=Norton|first5=D.
