A '''''zoospore''''' is an [[Asexuality|asexual]] [[spore]] that uses a [[flagellum]] for [[movement|moving]] around. It is also called a ''swarm spore''. These spores are created by some [[algae]] and [[fungi]] to [[:wikt:multiply|multiply]] themselves. 
 
 ==Flagella== 
 There are two types of flagellated zoospores, ''whiplash'' and ''tinsel'' or  " decorated " . 
 * ''Whiplash'' flagella are straight, to power the zoospore through its medium. There is also the 'default' zoospore, which only has the propelling, 'whiplash' flagellum. 
 * ''Tinsellated'' flagella have lateral [[filament]]s perpendicular to the main [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]], which allow for more surface area, and disturbance of the medium, giving it the property of a [[rudder]], which it uses for [[steer]]ing. 
 
 Both ''tinsel'' and ''whiplash'' flagella beat in a [[sinusoidal]] wave pattern, but when both are present, the tinsel will beat in the opposite direction of the whiplash, to give 2 axes of control of [[motility]]. 
 * There can be many combinations for location of the flagella, such as posterior whiplash; posterior whiplash, anterior tinsel; and anterior whiplash. 
 
 ==Zoosporangium== 
 A '''''zoosporangium''''' is the sexual structure in which the zoospores develop in a plant, fungi, or [[protist]]s.
