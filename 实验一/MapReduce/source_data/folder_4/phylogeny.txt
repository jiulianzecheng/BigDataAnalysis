 A '''phylogeny''' is a proposal of how organisms are related by their [[evolution]]ary history. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p336 < /sup >  It is based on the [[evidence]] that all living things are related by [[common descent]]. The [[evidence]] for phylogeny  comes from [[palaeontology]], [[comparative anatomy]], and [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]]. 
 
 The main product of '''phylogenetics''' is a '''phylogenetic tree''' or [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. This is a diagram showing a pattern of ancestor/descendent relationships. Information may be related to [[Historical geology|geological period]]s or estimated dates. A [[biological classification]] is another type of product.
