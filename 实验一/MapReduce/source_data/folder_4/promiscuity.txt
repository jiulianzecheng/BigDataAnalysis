 What sexual behavior is considered promiscuous varies between cultures, as does the [[frequency]] of promiscuity.

 Promiscuity is common in many animal species. < ref name=Barash > Lipton, Judith Eve  &  Barash, David P. 2001. ''The myth of monogamy: fidelity and infidelity in animals and people''. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman. {{ISBN|0-7167-4004-4}} < /ref >  Some species have promiscuous [[mating system]]s, ranging from [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] to mating systems with no stable relationships. Many species form stable [[pair bond]]s, but still mate with other individuals outside the pair.
