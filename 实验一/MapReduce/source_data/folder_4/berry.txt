The word '''berry''' is used for many different kinds of small [[fruit]]s that have many [[seeds]] and can be used as food. Some examples are [[raspberry]], [[strawberry]], sutberry, [[lingonberry]] and [[blueberry]]. 
 
 When [[botany|botanists]] talk about ''berries'', they mean a simple [[fruit]] produced from a single [[gynoecium|ovary]]. They sometimes call this ''true berry'', to distinguish it from ''false berries''. By that statement of how words are used, [[grape]]s or [[tomato]]es are true berries. 
 
 The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the [[pericarp]] which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have an upper ovary with one or more [[carpel]]s. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary. 
 
 Berries are small, sweet, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more [[animal]]s towards them and spread their [[seed]]s. 
 
 Some fruits that are called ''berries'' in [[English language|English]] are not ''true berries'' by the use of words above. These include [[raspberry|raspberries]], strawberry, sutberry, [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[cranberry|cranberries]], and [[boysenberry|boysenberries]]. Some true berries do not have ''berry'' in their name. These include [[tomato]]es, [[banana]]s, [[eggplant]]s, [[guava]]s, [[pomegranate]]s and [[chile pepper|chillies]]. [[Pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[melon]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]]s are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names ([[pepo]] for pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons, or [[hesperidium]] for oranges and lemons). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Bananas are Berries.
