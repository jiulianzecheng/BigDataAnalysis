 A '''router''' is a [[computer]] whose [[software]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]] are designed to move data between [[Computer network|computer networks]]. Routers move traffic to where it needs to go. They do this by choosing the shortest path between the computers using a complicated system of rules called [[routing protocol]]s. Most routers have a specialized [[operating system]], [[random access memory|RAM]], [[NVRAM]], [[flash memory]], and one or more [[central processing unit|processors]]. They also have two or more [[network card|network interface]]s.  They come in a variety of sizes from something that could hold in the hand to something too large for one person to lift. 
 
 If a computer has an connection to the [[Internet]], It is connected to a router that the computer sends data to. This is the first router the computer will connect to in order to get to the internet. It is known as a [[default gateway]] because it is the gateway to the internet. By convention, the gateway has the lowest [[IP address]] (like a phone number for a computer) in the [[subnet]] (a group of addresses). Anytime a computer makes a connection (such as a connection to www.wikipedia.org), the IP address of the destination server is found using a service called [[Domain Name System|DNS]] ([[Domain Name System]]). Once the destination address has been found, the computer connects to the gateway router. The gateway then sends data to a router at the [[Internet service provider|ISP]] ([[Internet service provider|Internet Service Provider]]). That router is a part of the internet and connects to other routers until the data reaches the destination.

 In small networks such as homes, small businesses (including [[internet caf√©]]s) and small schools, the router also performs [[Network address translation|NAT]] (network address translation) which makes all outgoing connections look like they come from one address. Typically, incoming connections are only allowed if they are replies to connections made by a computer inside the NAT. 
 
 Routers connect two or more networks and direct traffic between them.  These networks may be physical (the network is associated with a port) or logical (not associated with a port on the router). < ref > [ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1812.txt Requirements for IPv4 Routers],[[RFC:1812|RFC 1812]], F. Baker,June 1995 < /ref >  The term '''layer 3 switch''' often is used the same as 'router', but it is a general term without a technical definition.  Layer 3 switch implies a device that is built to connect [[Ethernet]] devices in a [[LAN]] but can also perform routing. 
 
 Router operating systems are split into two parts: < ref > [rfc:3654 Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding],[[RFC:3654|RFC 3654]], H. Khosravi  &  T. Anderson,November 2003 < /ref > 
 * The [[Control Plane]], where the router learns the best port to send data to for a specific destination 
 * The [[Forwarding Plane]], where the router does the work of sending data to its destination.
