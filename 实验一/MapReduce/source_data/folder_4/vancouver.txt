 Vancouver was founded in 1886, and is named after British naval captain [[George Vancouver]]. Captain Vancouver explored the area around Vancouver and [[Vancouver Island]] in the 1790s. 
 
 == Buildings and information == 
 The [[University of British Columbia]] is in Vancouver. 
 
 Vancouver also has [[Stanley Park]] which has beaches and [[totemism|totem poles]]. Nearby is [[Grouse Mountain]] which has good skiing and has a 2.9 & nbsp;km (1.8 & nbsp;mi.) [[hiking]] [[trail]] which is known as the Grouse Grind. Grouse Mountain also has an animal sanctuary, including [[wolf|wolves]] and [[bear]]s. 
 
 The [[Lions Gate Bridge]] is also in Stanley Park, Vancouver. 
 
 == Sports == 
 [[File:General Motors Place.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Rogers Arena]] is the home of the [[Vancouver Canucks]]]] 
 Vancouver has two [[ice hockey]] teams, the [[Vancouver Canucks]] (who play for the [[National Hockey League]]) and the [[Vancouver Giants]] (who play for the [[Western Hockey League]]). 
 
 The [[BC Lions]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] are based in Vancouver. The team has won 6 [[Grey Cup]]s. 
 
 In [[Association football|soccer]], Vancouver is home to the [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]]. They play in the [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). 
 
 The [[2010 Winter Olympics]] were held in Vancouver and it was the first time Canada won a gold medal on Canadian soil. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Vancouver is on a [[peninsula]] on the West Coast of Canada, less than a one-hour drive north of the Canada-U.S. [[border]]. 
 Between Vancouver and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west is a large island called [[Vancouver Island]]. Until the city was named in 1885,  " Vancouver "  referred to Vancouver Island. Some people mistakenly think that the city is on Vancouver Island.  
 On the south shore of Vancouver is the [[Fraser River]], which flows west into the [[Strait of Georgia]]. The water along the north shore is called [[Burrard Inlet]]. 
 The city has an area of 114 & nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (44 & nbsp;[[square mile|sq & nbsp;mi]]). The larger [[metropolitan area]] is 2,878 & nbsp;square kilometres (1,111 & nbsp;sq & nbsp;mi). 
 As with most of British Columbia, Vancouver is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC−8). 
 
 === Climate === 
 Vancouver has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). The average  [[precipitation]] per year is 1189 & nbsp;mm, mostly from October to April. High temperatures in the summer average 22 & nbsp;°C. The highest temperature ever recorded was 34.4 & nbsp;°C on July 30, 2009. On average, [[snow]] falls on only 11 days per year. The snow is usually wet, not very deep, and melts in the rain. On average, on only 4.5 days a year does the temperature not rise above freezing.

 ==Housing in Vancouver== 
 Vancouver has had  a [[housing affordability]] crisis for many years. < ref > [https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-vancouvers-escalating-housing-crisis-erupted-in-2016 Douglas Todd: Vancouver's housing crisis four decades in the making] < /ref >  It came in as the second-least affordable [[housing market]] compared with  90 other  metropolitan areas in different  countries. The only place  considered less  affordable was [[Hong Kong]]. < ref > [https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/why-ottawas-attempts-to-help-young-canadians-afford-housing-simply-wont-work Why Ottawa’s attempts to help young Canadians afford housing simply won’t work] < /ref > 
 
 Vancouver has been criticized for saying that it provides many [[social housing]] units to residents. However ''social housing'' can refer to small apartments renting for $1,700 per month. There are people with [[household income]]s of up to $120,000 living in ''social housing'' in Vancouver. < ref > [https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/dan-fumano-citys-definition-of-social-housing-includes-households-earning-80000-incomes Dan Fumano: 'Call it what it is' — Most Vancouver 'social housing' geared to $50,000+ incomes] < /ref > 
 
 The government has been attempting to address the housing crisis situation by imposing  a series of taxes such as the [[Foreign-buyers tax]]  and [[Empty Homes Tax]] in 2016 and [[Speculation tax]] in 2018. 
 
 [[Rents]] in Vancouver were very high, and apartment [[Rental vacancy rate|vacancies]] were very low in 2019. < ref > [https://vancouversun.com/homes/westcoast-homes-and-design/buying-selling-westcoast-homes-and-design/a-desperate-housing-situation-calls-for-desperate-measures A desperate housing situation calls for desperate measures] < /ref >
