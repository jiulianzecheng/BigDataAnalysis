 In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ull''' (or '''Ullr''' or '''Uller''') is the son of [[Sif]], and the stepson of [[Thor]]. He is thought to be the god of [[Winter]], of [[hunting]], of [[hand-to-hand combat]], and of the [[wikt:willow|willow]] tree. His name means  " glory " . He was said to be a great archer and skier who left blazing trails across the sky.  
 
 For this reason he is celebrated in modern times as the god of skiing. His name is used as a name for ski lodges like the House of Ullr at [[Thredbo, New South Wales]]. ULLR Labs make smartphone applications to help people avoid [[avalanche]]s.
