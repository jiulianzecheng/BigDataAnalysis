 '''Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar''' also simply known as '''Caesarion''' (June 23, 47 BC – August, 30 BC) was the son of [[Cleopatra VII]]. He ruled [[Egypt]] as a child with his mother Cleopatra until 30 BC. He was [[murder]]ed by Octavian, who would later become the Roman emperor Augustus. 
 
 Caesarion is probably the son of [[Julius Caesar]]. If so, he is the only known son of Caesar. 
 
 Caesarion was the last king ([[pharaoh]]) of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt.

 Caesarion was born in [[Egypt]] on 23 June 47 BC. His mother, [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], said that he was the son of Roman leader [[Julius Caesar]].

 Caesarion spent the first two years of his life, from 46 to 44 BC, in Rome. He and his mother, [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], were guests at [[Julius Caesar|Juilius Caesar’s]] villa (Horti Caesaris). Cleopatra wanted her son to become the leader of both the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Egypt]] after his father, Caesar. When Caesar was killed on March 15, 44 BC, Cleopatra and Caesarion went back to Egypt. At the age of three, [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] made Caesarion the ruler of Egypt with her on September 2, 44 BC. < ref > {{Cite web|last=King|first=Arienne|title=Caesarion|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/caesarion/|access-date=2023-12-06|website=World History Encyclopedia|language=en}} < /ref >

 From 44 BC until 36 BC, there are no informations about Caesarion. Two years later, in 34 BC, he appeared at two events called the Donations of Antioch and the Donations of Alexandria. These events were organized by [[Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]] to give lands that were controlled by Rome and Parthia to Caesarion and his siblings:  Alexander Helios, Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus. < ref > {{cite book |author=Rolf Strootman |article=Queen of Kings: Cleopatra & nbsp;VII and the Donations of Alexandria |pages=139–158 |editor1=M.

 In the year 34 BC, [[Mark Antony]] gave more land and titles in the east to Caesarion and his own three children with [[Cleopatra]]. Caesarion was called a god, [[Divi filius|the son of a god]], and  " King of Kings. "  This was a really big title that was never given by romans to their [[Alliance|allies]]. Some people thought this was a threat to the greatness of the Roman people. < ref > {{cite book |author=Meyer Reinhold |title=Studies in Classical History and Society |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=US |year=2002 |page=58}} < /ref >  Antony also said that Caesarion was really [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] son and should be the next ruler. This made Octavian (who became ruler because he was Julius Caesar's grandnephew and adopted son) very angry. These things caused a big fight between Antony and [[Augustus|Octavian]].  
   
 [[Octavian]] used how angry people were about these things to get support for fighting against [[Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]]. < ref > {{cite book |author-first=Stanley Mayer |author-last=Burstein |title=The Reign of Cleopatra |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=2007 |page=29}} < /ref >

 After Cleopatra and [[Mark Antony]] lost the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, Cleopatra wanted Caesarion to be the only ruler without her. She may have planned to leave with Antony. [[Octavian]] invaded Egypt and looked for Caesarion in 30 BC. [[Cleopatra]] might have sent Caesarion to a place called Berenice for safety, possibly so that he can escape to [[India]]. Plutarch said that Caesarion went to India, but he also said that Caesarion was tricked into returning to Egypt because [[Octavian]] told him that he'd let him rule [[Egypt]]. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Gray-Fow |first1=Michael |title=What to Do With Caesarion |journal=Greece  &  Rome |series=Second Series |date=April 2014 |volume=61 |issue=1 |page=62 |doi=10.1017/S0017383513000235 |jstor=43297487 |s2cid=154911628 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43297487}} < /ref >   
 When Caesarion went back to Egypt, Octavian killed him around 30 BC.
