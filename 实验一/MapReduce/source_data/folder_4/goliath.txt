 '''Goliath''' ({{lang-he|גָּלְיָת,}}) was a [[Philistine]] warrior in the [[Old Testament]]. He was the [[champion]] of the warriors of town of [[Gath]]. The name refers to Greek name Alyattes. 
 
 Goliath was unusually large. His height was said to be  " six cubits and a span "   - some 290 & nbsp;cm - and he fought as [[armour]]ed charioteer. The Bible describes how he challenged the [[Israel]]ite warriors for single-handed duel, but nobody dared to fight with him. 
 
 [[David]], who was fourteen years old at this time, finally answered to challenge. He was skilled on use of [[sling]], and he found out a way how he could win him. He accurately slung a stone on Goliath's forehead, just below his helmet. The stone knocked Goliath out. He fell to the ground. David then ran to unconscious Goliath, pulled his [[sword]] off the scabbard, and [[decapitation|cut his head off]]. Seeing a fourteen-year-old boy killing their champion, the Philistine army demoralized. 
 
 The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] say Goliath's height was a more credible  " four cubits and a span " , in modern measurements 202 & nbsp;cm. At the era when man's average height was some 160 & nbsp;cm, he would still have looked like a giant.
