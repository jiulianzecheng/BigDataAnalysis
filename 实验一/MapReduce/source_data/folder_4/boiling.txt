 '''Boiling''' is the phase change that occurs when a [[liquid]] becomes gas throughout the substance. When [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s are formed you can tell a substance is boiling. This is not to be confused with [[evaporation]]. 
 
 The temperature at which boiling happens is called the [[boiling point]] and depends on the particular nature of the [[chemical substance|substance]]. 
 
 For example, [[water]] boils at around 100 [[Celsius|Â°C]] (Celsius degrees). When water is boiling, it transforms into a [[vapor]] called [[water vapor]].
