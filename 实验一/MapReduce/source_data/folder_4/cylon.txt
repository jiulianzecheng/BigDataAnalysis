The '''Cylons''' are [[fiction]]al [[robot]]s on the [[science fiction]] [[television programme|television series]] ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''.  
 
 == The Story So Far == 
 
 The people from the [[Twelve Colonies of Kobol]] created the Cylon robots. They told them to work for them and fight for them. The Cylons stood up to the people from the Colonies and fought against them. The Cylons went away after the [[war]] and changed into real people as well as robots. After forty years, the Cylons came back and almost killed all the people in the Colonies. They went after the people that were not killed in many [[spacecraft|ships]]. 
 
 == Types of Cylons == 
 
 *Skinjob Cylons look the same as normal people. It is very hard to know if they are Cylons or normal people. There are many Skinjobs that look the same. There are only twelve looks. Cylons that look the same do not always act the same. 
 
 *Centurions are [[metal]] robots with [[armor]]. Humans sometimes call them [[toaster]]s because they are shiny like a toaster. Centurions fight and work.  They are the only type of Cylons to not be alive. 
 
 *Cylon raiders are small ships that fight other small ships. The ship is actually a type of animal.
