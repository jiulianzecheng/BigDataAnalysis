 '''''Tonkatsu''''' ({{lang|ja|豚カツ}}, {{lang|ja|とんかつ}} or {{lang|ja|トンカツ}}) is a [[Japan]]ese dish of fried [[pork]] meat.  
 
 Either pork [[fillet]] or pork [[loin]], is sliced. It is then coated in flour, dipped into beaten eggs,  and rolled in breadcrumbs. It is then fried in hot oil. People often use a Japanese [[Worcester sauce]], but some use a vinegar-soy-sauce called ponzu when they eat it. ''Tonkatsu'' originated as a [[cutlet]], but it is also used as a [[sandwich]] filling or in combination with [[curry]].  
 
 ''Tonkatsu'' originated in Japan in the 19th century. Now it is known as a [[Japanese food]] by most of the world. It is usually prepared for special occasions, for example a [[wedding]]. It is always served with a type of alcoholic drink.
