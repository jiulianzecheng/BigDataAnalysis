 An '''adze''' is an ancient type of  " edge tool " . < ref > Edge tool = any tool with a sharp cutting edge. Oxford English Dictionary. < /ref >  It dates back to the [[stone age]].  
 
 Adzes are used for smoothing or carving [[wood]] in hand [[woodworking]]. They are similar to an [[axe]], but with the head mounted [[perpendicular]] (at right angles) to the handle. The cutting edge was made from chipped [[flint]] in the [[Mesolithic]], polished stone in the [[Neolithic]], and metal later on. 
 
 A very similar (but blunt) tool used for digging in hard ground is called a [[mattock]].
