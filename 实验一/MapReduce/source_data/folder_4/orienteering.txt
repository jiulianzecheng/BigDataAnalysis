 where people run around an area to certain control points given on a [[map]]. There are lots of types of orienteering and the most popular type in Britain and the US is called '''Foot Orienteering'''. In orienteering people use a special map which shows where they have to go and in what order. People are timed and the person who is quickest wins. The word ''Orienteering'' comes from orientering, which is a word that comes from [[Sweden]]. < ref name= " orientering " > Palmer, Peter (1997). ''The Complete Orienteering Manual''.
