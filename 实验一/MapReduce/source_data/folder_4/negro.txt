 It is usually considered an offensive term nowadays. Words such as 'black' or 'African American' are preferred. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 " Negro "  replaced the term  " [[colored]] "  as the more [[wikt:polite|polite]] term. This was done when the term  " black "  was more [[offensive]]. This use of the word was accepted as normal during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. It was accepted even by the people it was used to describe.  One example of this is [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] using the term  " negro "  when talking about his own [[race (biology)|race]] in his 1963 [[speech]]  " [[I Have a Dream]] " . 
 
 During the Civil Rights Movement, some [[African American]] leaders in the [[United States]] did not like this word. People like [[Malcolm X]] wanted the word  " Black "  to be used. < ref > Smith, Tom W. (1992)  " Changing racial labels: from 'Colored' to 'Negro' to 'Black' to 'African American'. "  ''Public Opinion Quarterly'' '''56'''(4):496-514. < /ref >  This was because they saw a [[connection]] between the term  " Negro "  and [[slavery]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and [[discrimination]]. 
 
 The word is now usually considered offensive and outdated. Since the late 1960s, many other terms have been more commonly used. These include  " [[Black people|Black]] " ,  " [[Black African]] " ,  " [[Afro-American]] "  and  " [[African American]] " . The words  " African American "  have been used in the [[United States]] to refer to Black Americans. < ref > Christopher H. Foreman. ''The African-American predicament''. Brookings Institution Press, 1999, p. 99. < /ref > 
 
 ==Modern day== 
 The term  " Negro "  is still used in some ways. It is used by the [[United Negro College Fund]] < ref > [http://www.uncf.org UNCF New Brand < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > < ref name= " NYTimesUNCFName " > {{cite news

 The [[United States Census Bureau]] said that  " Negro "  would be used on the [[2010 United States Census]], with  " Black "  and  " African-American " . This was because some older black Americans still feel this is the word that describes them. < ref > [http://2010.census.gov/2010census/how/interactive-form.php U.S. Census Bureau interactive form, Question 9.

 ==In English== 
 Around 1442 the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first went to [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. They were trying to find a way to get to [[India]] by [[boat]]. The term  " ''negro'' "  was used by the [[Spain|Spanish]] and Portuguese as a simple [[description]] of people. It means  " black " . From the [[18th century]] to the late 1960s,  " negro "  was the proper [[English-language]] term for most people of [[Sahara Desert|sub-Saharan]] African origin. 
 
 Most people stopped using the word  " Negro "  by the early 1970s in the [[United States]]. Many older African Americans grew up when  " Negro "  was ''widely'' said to be the correct term. They thought the term  " [[black people|Black]] "  was more offensive than  " Negro. "  This can be seen by the use the word by [[history|historical]] [[African-American]] [[organization]]s and [[institution]]s. Currently,  " Negro "  is ''generally'' thought to be not offensive when used in a historical way. For example, [[baseball]]'s [[Negro Leagues]] of the early and mid-[[20th century]]. It is also used in the name of older organizations. These include [[Negro spirituals]], the [[United Negro College Fund]] or the [[Journal of Negro Education]]. The U.S. Census now uses  " Black, African-American or Negro. "  The term  " Negro "  is used to try to include older African Americans who think it is a better term. < ref > {{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/01/06/2010-01-06_census_negro_issue_use_of_word_on_forms_raises_hackles_memories_of_jim_crow.html |place= New York |work= Daily News |title= Use of word Negro on 2010 census forms raises memories of Jim Crow |first1= Katie |last1= Mcfadden |first2= Larry |last2= Mcshane |date= 6 January 2010 |access-date= 2012-02-15 |archive-date= 2010-01-09 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100109012939/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/01/06/2010-01-06_census_negro_issue_use_of_word_on_forms_raises_hackles_memories_of_jim_crow.html |url-status= dead }} < /ref >
