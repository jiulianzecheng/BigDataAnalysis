 The RMS '''''Titanic''''' < ref > RMS is an [[acronym]].  RMS stands for '''R'''oyal '''M'''ail '''S'''hip or '''S'''teamer. RMS is a ship prefix for vessels that carry mail under contract to the British [[Royal Mail]]. < /ref >  was a [[United Kingdom|British]] passenger [[ship]]. She was built by Harland and Wolff ship builders, in [[Belfast]], for the [[White Star Line]] shipping company. She sank during her first trip at sea. 
 
 Before ''Titanic'' sailed, many people thought it would be almost impossible for ships of this design to sink, due to her configuration of watertight bulkheads < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sinking-the-unsinkable/|title=FACT CHECK: The Unsinkable Titanic|website=Snopes.com}} < /ref >  and an incident involving her older sister ''Olympic''. 
 
 == Design and Construction == 
 After [[Cunard Line]] launched their two sister ships ''Mauritania'' and ''Lusitania'', White Star knew they had to be better. They responded by making plans for three sister ships, named ''Olympic'', ''Titanic'', and ''Gigantic'' (later renamed to ''Britannic'').  
 
 The three sisters would have been the biggest ships ever at the time, standing at an impressive 882.6 feet long, and 175 feet high from the very bottom to the [[Chimney|funnels]].  
 
 They were also to be the most luxurious ships ever designed. Accommodations for first class included a [[gymnasium]], four dining location options (Dining saloon, Cafe Parisian, A La Carte Resturant, and the Veranda Cafe), a [[swimming pool]], and a Turkish bath. Second class had a [[library]], which was used by first and second class. All of the classes had lounges, promenade (decks where you can walk and relax, and [[Smoking room|smoking rooms]].  
 [[File:Titanic bow.jpg|thumb|The bow of ''Titanic'' under construction in [[Belfast]].]] 
 ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' began construction as build numbers 400 and 401, respectively. The two ships were built next to eachother in Harland and Wolff's shipyard. Nearly three million [[Rivet|rivets]] were used for ''Titanic''.   
 
 In September of 1911, ''Olympic'' collided with the British warship HMS ''Hawke''. The damaged ''Olympic'' went back to port for repairs, making Titanic's building late. 
 
 == The Voyage == 
 ''Titanic'' < nowiki/ > 's voyage was going badly before it even started. The Coal Strike of 1912 caused many smaller ships' trips to be cancelled and their passengers transferred to ''Titanic''. A passenger who booked first class on ''Oceanic'', another White Star Line ship, was offered second class on ''Titanic''. He declined the offer. 
 
 Famous passengers aboard included American rich man [[John Jacob Astor IV]], American fashion icon [[Molly Brown|Margaret Brown]], and [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]'s military aide, Archibald Butt. 
 
 Important cargo included a jeweled copy of the Rubaiyat, a red [[Renault]] car owned by William Carter, 12 cases of [[ostrich]] feathers, and 76 cases of  " [[Dragons blood|Dragon's blood]] < ref > {{Cite web|date=2003-08-28|title=Cargo Manifest|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/cargo-manifest.html|access-date=2023-12-08|website=www.encyclopedia-titanica.org|language=en}} < /ref > . " 
 
 She left from Southampton, England at noon on April 10, 1912. ''Titanic'' nearly hit the American steamer SS ''New York''. Due to this delay, she arrived in the ports of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] and [[Cobh|Queenstown]] about two hours later than expected. 
 
 ''Titanic'' received more than ten ice warnings from various vessels across the Atlantic, warning her of icebergs on her planned route. Captain Smith ordered the ship to steer to the south to not hit an iceberg. 
 
 A lifeboat drill on April 14 was cancelled because Captain Smith held a Sunday service in the first class dining saloon.  
 
 ''Titanic'' < nowiki/ > 's [[wireless]] operators received a warning from the SS ''Californian''. The operators, who were behind in sending messages due to a broken radio system the day previous, told ''Californian'' to shut up and keep out. ''Titanic'' was working to the [[Cape Race]] radio station, nearly 400 miles away. As such, ''Titanic'' had to have their headphones turned up to max to hear them. When ''Californian'' buzzed in, the noise was so loud it nearly deafened ''Titanic'' < nowiki/ > 's operators. ''Californian'' shut down their radio system for the night. 
 
 == The Sinking  == 
 [[File:Titanic.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' at [[Southampton]] docks, prior to its departure, 10 April 1912.]] 
 [[File:Titanic in color.png|thumb|The Titanic leaving [[Southampton]] on 10 April 1912 (Colorized).]] 
 At 11:40  < small > PM < /small >  on 14 April 1912, during the ''Titanic'' < nowiki/ > 's first trip, it hit an [[iceberg]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The iceberg tore gashes into the ''Titanic'' < nowiki/ > 's lower [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], letting [[water]] into the ship. The ''Titanic'' sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20  < small > AM < /small >  on 15 April 1912. 
 
 Lifeboats were lowered with the order  " women and children first, "  calling for men to step back and allow their wives and children into the boats before them. As the bow dipped underwater, passengers and crew began to panic, sometimes overfilling lifeboats.  
 
 The officers used their [[Revolver|revolvers]] in an attempt to keep order. One of the officers supposedly shot two passengers before turning his gun on himself. Captain Smith gave the order  " every man for himself, "  calling for the crew to abandon their posts, as the sinking had gotten to a point where any sense of order had evaporated. 
 
 The sinking accelerated as water reached the boat deck, with the final two lifeboats having to be cut free from the deck and floated off. The ship's forward two funnels also collapsed when water reached their bases, sucking anyone unfortunate enough to be near them to the boiler rooms. 
 
 Two minutes before she went under, the ''Titanic'' split in two. The ship was then claimed by the dead-calm, freezing-cold ocean. The wreck killed around 1,500 people. Only 705 people lived, out of the roughly 2,200 aboard. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://kids.nationalgeographic.com//|title=Kids' Games, Animals, Photos, Stories, and More -- National Geographic Kids|website=Kids}} < /ref >  It was one of the worst [[List of shipwrecks|shipwrecks]] up to that point that was not during a war. 
 [[File:Titanic-New York Herald front page.jpeg|thumb|Titanic-New York Herald front page. Wrong numbers were posted in the first days after the accident, due to the lack of information. But already, dramatic illustrations of the event were in print.]] 
 One reason why so many people died was that the ship did not have enough [[lifeboat]]s for everyone on board. The ''Titanic'' had 20 lifeboats with room for 1,178 passengers, only about a third of the number of passengers the ship could carry. It actually had more lifeboats than was needed by law (it needed 16 with room for 990 passengers). This was because the laws put forth by the British Board of Trade were out of date. They did not say that a ship needed enough lifeboats for all passengers. They only said that a ship weighing more than 10,000 tons needed 16 lifeboats (the Titanic weighed 46,000 tons). Furthermore, the White Star Line believed that the lifeboats on the ''Titanic'' would only be needed to take passengers a short distance to a rescue ship. 
 
 Higher class women and children were allowed on the lifeboats first, and passengers who sailed in first class (which meant that they paid for better rooms on the ship) were allowed on before other passengers. Few of the poorer people who had paid less (called second class and third class passengers) got out safely. Stories persist of the third class passengers being locked behind massive floor-to-ceiling gates, but those stories are merely a myth. A similar event that did occur, however, was the staff of the A La Carte Restaurant being locked in their cabins overnight. They were not employed by White Star and were mostly immigrants. Only two of them, who happened to be outside their cabins when they were locked, survived. The rest drowned, locked away below decks. 
 [[File:Titanic Deck Plans.jpg|thumb|The Titanic's deck plans.]] 
 
 
 Several of the wealthier passengers stepped aside to allow the women and children into the lifeboats. Among them was the American businessman [[Benjamin Guggenheim]], who was spoke to his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] right before she left in one of the boats.  < blockquote > Tell my wife I've done my best in doing my duty. We are dressed in our best and prepared to go down as gentlemen. No woman shall die because Ben Guggenheim was a coward. < /blockquote > Another reason so few people survived was that the radio was off on the ''SS Californian'', the ship closest to the ''Titanic''. The ''Californian'' < nowiki/ > 's crew did not hear about the accident until the morning afterwards. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://jproc.ca/radiostor/titanic.html |author=Brett, Allan|title=Radio Story}} < /ref >  Also, the ''Titanic'' did have flares but they were white. Back then, and still today, red meant emergency and other colors were used for identification. ''Californian'' saw the flares and assumed they were either company signals or sealing ships signaling to one another. < ref > {{Citation|title=Google|url=https://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2020/thank-you-grocery-workers-6753651837108758-2xa.gif|accessdate=2020-04-13|language=en}} < /ref >  Another ship, the RM''S Carpathia'', did hear about the accident and collected all 705 survivors. < ref > {{Cite web|last=National Geographic|date=2012-04-05|title=How Titanic Sank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSGeskFzE0s|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Youtube|format=video}} < /ref >  Other vessels from all over the Atlantic came rushing to aid the stricken liner. 
 
 The high death toll had several reasons: 
 
 * There was no information. The ship didn't have an alarm system (like the common ones, where sirens could be sounded). This means that the crew had to tell each passenger to go and evacuate the ship. There was less crew for second and third class, and there were many more people, so less people lived. 
 * People who paid less had no access to certain deck stairs. 
 * Many people travelling in third class were foreigners. Their language skills were limited, and they didn't know what was going on. The signs being only in English didn't do them any favors. 
 Many of those who died didn't die because they couldn't leave the ship before it sank. They died of hypothermia, while they were floating in the cold water, which was 28 degrees Fahrenheit (-2 Celcius). < ref name= " Spitz, 2006 " > D. J. Spitz: ''Investigation of Bodies in Water.'' In: W. U. Spitz, D. J. Spitz (Hrsg.): ''Spitz and Fisher’s Medicolegal Investigation of Death. Guideline for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigations (Fourth edition).'' Charles C. Thomas, Springfield (Illinois) 2006, S. 846–881. < /ref >  When the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] arrived, at 4.10 ship's time, there were many floating dead bodies in the water. Many lifeboats rowed away from those who were in the water shouting for help. Most lifeboats also did not go back to the ship, like lifeboat 6. The people on the lifeboats were scared because the sinking might cause their boats to be pulled under by the waves. The people in the lifeboats were afraid the lifeboat would capsize when people entered it from the water. Only lifeboat 4 returned to the shouting people in the water. Five people could be rescued, but two of them died in the lifeboat. Around 3 AM ship's time, 40 minutes after the sinking, the last calls for help ceased. After 3 AM, lifeboat 14, commanded by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, returned. He managed to save another three people. He had let the people in the boat enter other boats before he went back.   
 
 The following table gives a listing of those who died and those who survived, grouped by age, gender and ships class. Children are those up to age 12. It is taken from a report to British Parliament of 1912. < ref > British Parliamentary Papers, Shipping Casualties (Loss of the Steamship “Titanic”), 1912, cmd. 6352, ‘Report of a Formal Investigation into the circumstances attending the foundering on the 15th April, 1912, of the British Steamship “Titanic”, of Liverpool, after striking ice in or near Latitude 41°46'N. Longitude 50°14'W., North Atlantic Ocean, whereby loss of life ensued.’ (London: His Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1912), page 42, korrigiert um die nachweislich verstorbene 3-jährige Lorraine Allison (1. & nbsp;Klasse) < /ref >  There are other lists, with slightly different numbers.

 == Changes after the Accident == 
 The ''Titanic'' disaster changed many maritime ship laws. Because so many people died, authorities felt that laws should be put into place to make ship travel safer. Changes included requiring all ships to carry enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship, and emergency materials such as flares.  Someone must be at the ship's radio all the time to respond to distress calls. The disaster also caused the creation of the International Ice Patrol, an organization dedicated to warning maritime vessels of icebergs in the Atlantic. 
 
 Alexander Brehm, a German physicist, was shocked when he heard about the disaster. He wanted to invent a technology that would be able to detect icebergs. He wasn't able to achieve that goal until his death, but he was granted patents relating to the measurement of the depth at sea, using sound. Today, this is known as [[echo sounding]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Franz Neumann|date=1925|title=Die Entstehung des Echolots und sein Erfinder.|url=http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/article/pj340/ar340019|journal=Polytechnisches Journal|volume=340|pages=44–45|via=|access-date=2020-08-16|archive-date=2021-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831184523/http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/article/pj340/ar340019|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 ==Discovery and Expeditions== 
 [[File:Titanic wreck bow.jpg|thumb|left|''Titanic''{{'}}s bow, photographed in 2004.]] 
 The wreck was found by a French and American team, led by Dr. Robert Ballard, on September 1, 1985 early that morning by the DSV Alvin, a ship that goes down very deep (submersible).  
 
 In 1986, Ballard returned to the wreck with a submarine. He took many photos and made lots of films and footage, and he got really famous.  
 
 In 1987, a French team on the DSV Nautile, a ship that goes under the water, salvaged some 900 objects and took them to the surface. This act made some people very angry because they thought that the Titanic should be left alone, as it is a place where lots of people died. 
 
 In June 1994, the U.S. gave RMS Titanic Inc, which used to be known as Titanic Ventures, full permission to take whatever it would like from the wreck. 
 
 In September of 2000, a Russian ''Titanic'' tour submersible got caught in a high-speed underwater current and smashed into one of the ship's propellers. They managed to free themselves with mostly no damage to either ship.  
 
 In June of 2023, the Oceangate submersible ''Titan'' lost contact with the surface and [[2023 Titan submersible incident|imploded]], resulting in the deaths of five very rich people who paid 250,000 dollars to trip down to the ''Titanic.'' 
 
 In August of 2023, RMS Titanic Inc made plans to go to the wreck and recover the radio machine from the wreck. This was met lots of anger, as people were worried the expedition would hurt the ship. The US government did not want the company to do this, so they probably won't. 
 
 == Culture == 
 [[File:Titanic Movie Cinema shooting. Airstar Lighting balloons.jpg|thumb|Filming James Cameron's ''Titanic'', 1997.]] 
 The story of the sinking has been made into several movies. The most popular film version is [[James Cameron]]'s 1997 film starring [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] called ''[[Titanic (1997 movie)|Titanic]]''. It won 11 [[Academy Awards]], tying ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 movie)|Ben-Hur]]'' for the record for the most Academy Awards won by one movie.  
 
 Other movie versions of the story include the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (movie)|A Night to Remember]]'', the 1953 film ''Titanic'', the 1979 film ''S.O.S. Titanic ''and the 1996 miniseries ''[[Titanic (1996 TV miniseries)|Titanic]]''. 
 
 In the 1980 film ''Raise the Titanic'', directed by Jerry Lameson, salvagers raise the shipwreck from the bottom of the ocean to the surface in one piece. However, this is impossible to do in reality. The ''Titanic'' broke in two, and the wreck is partially stuck in the bottom, buried under more than a yard (1 m) of mud in some spots. The ship has been on the ocean floor for more than 100 years, and would break into many more pieces if disturbed.  Worms and other animals have eaten away much of the wood and many other parts. 
 
 Countless books also exist of the event, the most famous of these being A Night to Remember, the 1953 book that inspired the 1958 film of the same name. 
 
 Several video games have been made about the sinking, most notably the 1996 game ''Titanic: Adventure out of Time'', and the still-in-development video game ''Titanic: Honor and Glory''.
