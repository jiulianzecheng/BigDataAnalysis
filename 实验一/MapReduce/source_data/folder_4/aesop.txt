 '''Aesop''', or '''Æsop''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Αἴσωπος'' ''Aisopos''), is known for his [[fable]]s. He was, by tradition, a slave of [[Africa]]n descent who lived from about 620 BC to 560 BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. 
 
 Aesop's Fables are still taught as moral lessons and used as subjects for entertainment, especially children's plays and [[cartoon]]s. Aesop is ''said'' to have written thousands of fables, but none has been verified. This means we do not know whether he wrote any, or perhaps just collected them. His most famous one was perhaps ''[[The Lion and the Mouse]]''. 
 
 No writings by him survive. Tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages. This is a storytelling tradition that continues to the present day. Many of the tales have animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics. 
 
 The tradition is that he was at one point freed from slavery and that he eventually died at the hands of [[Delphi, Greece|Delphians]]. In fact, the doubt about his life has led some to deny his existence altogether. 
 
 His most famous fable is a [[parable]] of the [[tortoise]] and the [[hare]]. In this story, a rabbit challenges a tortoise to a race. The rabbit is sure of its victory and as a result, depending on the version of the story, in some way completes the race slower than the turtle. Often, the hare takes a nap or takes too many breaks. The persistent tortoise, despite being slower, wins because it persevered. 
 
 The [[Qur'an| Qur'anic]] figure ''Luqman'' ([[Arabic]]: لقمان) is often identified with Aesop, whose lore is found in several ancient cultures. < ref > https://books.google.com/books?id=pMuxLlWih04C & dq=luqman+generally+identified+with+aesop & pg=PA70 < /ref > < ref > https://books.google.com/books?id=W3rjDAAAQBAJ & dq=luqman+aesop & pg=PT202 < /ref > < ref > https://books.google.com/books?id=NoqDBwAAQBAJ & dq=luqman+reference+to+aesop & pg=PA368 < /ref >  At some time during the [[Middle Ages]], much was transferred to Luqman that was told in Europe of Aesop. < ref > https://books.google.com/books?id=jJY3AAAAIAAJ & dq=luqman+traditionally+aesop & pg=PA812 < /ref >  This identification with Aesop is confirmed by the fact that many of the fables ascribed to Aesop in the west are referred to Luqman in the east. < ref > https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc88AAAAIAAJ & dq=luqman+similar+to+aesop & pg=PR76 < /ref >

 '''''Aesop's Fables''''' or ''Aesopica'' refers to a collection of [[fable]]s credited to Aesop. Aesop's Fables has also become a [[blanket term]] for collections of brief fables, usually involving personified animals. 
 
 The fables remain a popular choice for [[moral]] education of children today. Many stories included in Aesop's Fables, such as ''[[The Fox and the Grapes]]'' (from which the [[idiom]]  " sour grapes "  was derived), ''The Tortoise and the Hare'' (see [[Zeno's paradoxes]]) and ''The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf'' (also known as ''[[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]]''), are well known throughout the world.
