 == Biography == 
 Benerib was married to the pharaoh [[Hor-Aha]], but she was not the mother of his successor, Djer. The mother of King [[Djer]] is  [[Khenthap]], another wife of Hor-Aha. < ref > [[Aidan Dodson]]  &  Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames  &  Hudson (2004), p.46 < /ref >  Benerib is believed to be the wife of [[Hor-Aha]] because items with his name were found in her tomb at Abydos. A piece of an [[ivory]] box with the names of Hor-Aha and Benerib was also discovered at Abydos and is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. < ref > B. Porter and R.L.B. Moss.

 [[Egyptologist]] John Romer suggested that Benerib’s name, which can mean “sweetheart” or “one who is pleasant at heart”, might not be a name at all but rather a title or description for a person whose gender is also uncertain from the name. Benerib’s titles are unknown, and also the identity of her parents.  < ref name= " Romer " > {{Cite book|title=A History of Ancient Egypt: From the First Farmers to the Great Pyramid|last=Romer|first=John|publisher=Penguin|year=2013|isbn=978-0-14139-971-3|location=London|page=218}} < /ref >
