 '''Tuatara''' (''Sphenodon punctatus'') are a species of [[reptile]]s which look like [[lizard]]s. However, they are the only surviving member of an [[Order (biology)|order]] of reptiles which flourished 200 million years ago. 
 
 There is now only the genus '''''Sphenodon''''', with two [[species]] of Tuatara. Both are [[wikt:endemic|endemic]] to (only live in) [[New Zealand]]. Lizards and [[snake]]s are the closest living relatives of the tuatara. 
 
 Tuatara are green-brown, and measure up to 80 & nbsp;cm from head to the end of their tail. < ref name =  " san diego " > {{cite web| title =Reptiles:Tuatara| work = Animal bytes| publisher =Zoological Society of San Diego| date =2007| url =http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-tuatara.html| accessdate = 2007-06-01 }} < /ref >  They have a spiny crest along the back: the [[MƒÅori language|Maori]] word ''tuatara'' refers to this. < ref name= " KCC " > {{cite web | title=The Tuatara| work =Kiwi Conservation Club: fact sheets| publisher =Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand Inc.| date = 2007 |url=http://www.kcc.org.nz/animals/tuatara.asp| accessdate=2007-06-02}} < /ref > 
 The crest is more pronounced in males. Tuatara are special in many ways. One of these is the pattern of their teeth. They have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw overlap one row on the lower jaw. This is unique among living species. 
 
 == Sense organs == 
 === Third 'eye' === 
 Tuatara are also unusual because they have a [[Parietal eye|third 'eye']]. They have two normal eyes. The third eye is on top of their head, in between their other eyes. It does not see like a normal eye. The parietal eye, as it is called, is only visible in hatchlings. They have a [[translucent]] patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months this becomes covered with [[Opacity|opaque]] scales and [[pigment]]. < ref name=encyclo / > 
 
 The function of the parietal eye is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing [[ultraviolet]] rays to manufacture [[vitamin D]]. < ref name= " KCC " / >  It may also do other things. < ref name=encyclo / >  Of all living tetrapods, the parietal eye is most obvious in this animal. The parietal eye is part of the [[pineal gland|pineal]] system. The animal's [[pineal gland]] secretes melatonin at night. < ref name=encyclo / >  Some [[salamander]]s use their pineal body to perceive polarised light, which helps navigation. < ref > Halliday, Tim R. 2002. ''Salamanders and newts: finding breeding ponds.'' In: Halliday, Tim and Adler, Kraig (eds) ''The new encyclopedia of reptiles and amphibians'', Oxford University Press, Oxford. p52. {{ISBN|0-19-852507-9}} < /ref >  Unlike lizards they have no eardrums or external male sexual organ. 
 
 === Hearing === 
 Tuataras do not have ears, but they can hear. They have a number of unique features in their [[skeleton]] ([[bone]]s), some of them shared through common descent with [[fish]]. 
 
 == Endangered species == 
 The tuatara has been classified as an [[endangered species]] since 1895. < ref name=encyclo > {{cite web |last=Cree |first =Allison |author2= David Butler |title= Tuatara recovery plan |work= Threatened species recovery plan series #9 |publisher= Threatened Species Unit, Department of Conservation, Government of New Zealand |date= 1993 |url= http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/TSRP09.pdf |accessdate= 2007-06-02}} {{ISBN|0478014627}} < /ref > < ref > {{Harvnb|Newman|1987}}. < /ref >  The second species, ''S. guntheri'', was not discovered until 1989. < ref name= " san diego " / > 
 
 Tuatara, like many of New Zealand's native animals, are threatened by [[habitat]] loss and the introduced [[Polynesian Rat]] ''Rattus exulans''. They were [[extinct]] on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32 offshore islands, < ref name= " DoC " > {{cite web |title=Facts about tuatara |work =Conservation: Native Species |publisher=Threatened Species Unit, Department of Conservation, Government of New Zealand |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=33163 |accessdate= 2007-02-10 }} < /ref >  until the first mainland release into the heavily fenced and monitored [[Karori Wildlife Sanctuary]] in 2005. < ref name= " karori " > {{cite web |title= Tuatara factsheet (''Sphenodon punctatus'') |work= Sanctuary wildlife |publisher= Karori Sanctuary Wildlife Trust |url= http://www.sanctuary.org.nz/restoration/forest/tuatara/tuatara-facts.html |accessdate= 2007-06-02 |archive-date= 2007-09-29 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034626/http://www.sanctuary.org.nz/restoration/forest/tuatara/tuatara-facts.html |url-status= dead }} < /ref >
