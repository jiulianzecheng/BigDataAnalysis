 '''Parmigiana''' is a Southern [[Italy|Italian]] dish made with a shallow-fried sliced filling, with [[cheese]] and [[tomato sauce]] on top, then [[baking|baked]]. [[Eggplant]] parmigiana is the earliest version. Other kinds made with breaded meat [[cutlet]]s, such as [[veal]] and [[chicken]] parmigiana, are popular in other countries, usually in areas with a lot of Italian [[immigrants]].   
 
 == History == 
 The dish is claimed by both [[Campania]] and [[Sicily]]. While  " parmigiana "  means  " from [[Parma]] "  (in [[Northern Italy]]), the dish is not part of [[Province of Parma#Cuisine|Parma food]]. It is based on melanzane alla parmigiana (alt. parmigiana di melanzane) or [[eggplant]] parmigiana (or eggplant Parmesan), a classic Southern Italian dish.  
 
 Along with the many Italian versions, different kinds of Parmigiana have been developed across the world, most often in countries where large numbers of Italians immigrated. Examples of dishes developed outside of Italy from the early parmigianas include [[veal]] ('''Veal Parmigiana''') or [[chicken]] breast ('''Chicken Parmigiana''') dipped in beaten eggs, breaded, shallow-fried and topped with a [[marinara sauce]] (red Sicilian tomato sauce) and [[mozzarella]]. It is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown.  The veal dish is known in Italian as ''Cotolette alla Bolognese''. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/beefbracioleetc/r/blr0229.htm |title=Veal Parmigiana Recipe - Cotolette alla Bolognese - Easy Veal Parmigiana Recipe - |access-date=2011-03-15 |archive-date=2014-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712164720/http://italianfood.about.com/od/beefbracioleetc/r/blr0229.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ''Parmigiana'' is also used as an [[adjective]] in the names of other unrelated dishes from Parma food, such as ''Trippa alla Parmigiana'' (Parma-style tripe). 
 
 ==Cooking== 
 The dish consists of a sliced filling [[pan frying|pan fried]] in oil, layered with tomato sauce and cheese, and baked in an [[oven]].  In some kinds, the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and covered in flour or breadcrumbs before frying.  Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as [[Parmesan]] or [[Pecorino Romano]], while others use softer melting cheeses like [[Mozzarella]] or [[Caciocavallo]], or a combination of these. 
 
 == International variations ==

 In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], veal parmigiana or chicken parmigiana is commonly served as a [[grinder]] or a [[submarine sandwich]].  It is also popular with a side of or on top of [[pasta]].  Diced [[onions]] or green [[bell pepper]]s, saut√©ed or raw, are sometimes added. 
 
 Chicken or veal parmigiana has become very popular in [[Australia]] as a [[pub]] dish, often served with chips and salad. It may also contain a lot of toppings, including sliced ham or fried eggplant slices. This dish is often referred to as a  ''parma'' or ''parmi'', a simple shortening of the name. However, as Italian pronunciations are phonetic and do not use long vowel sounds,  " parma "  is incorrect.  
 
 A similar dish, the [[Parmo]], which uses either [[pork]] or chicken, has been made within the country of [[England]]. 
 
 == Name == 
 There are several theories for the origin of the name ''parmigiana''. 
 
 One common theory says the name is from [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]] (Parmesan cheese). < ref > [[Oxford English Dictionary]] < /ref > 
 
 Another theory says the name is an alteration of the [[Sicilian dialect|Sicilian]] word ''parmiciana'': 
 < blockquote > This is an ancient Sicilian dish which, in all cookbooks, is erroneously stated as obtaining its name from Parmesan cheese, which is one of the ingredients. Nothing could be further from the truth. The name  " parmigiana "  does not derive from that of the cheese but is the Italianization of the Sicilian dialectal word  " parmiciana " , which refers to the slats of wood which compose the central part of a shutter and overlap in the same manner as the slices of eggplant in the dish. " < ref > translated from Anna Pomar, ''La Cucina tradizionale siciliana'' < /ref > < /blockquote > 
 
 As with [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]] cheese, the word ''Parmigiana'' is often rendered as  " Parmesan "  in [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, from the French word for  " from Parma. "
