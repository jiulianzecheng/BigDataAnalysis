 '''Consonno''' is a part of the town of [[Olginate]], near [[Como]], in [[Italy]]. It is a [[ghost town]] today. The village has a long history, going back to the 11th century. In the 1960s, Mario Bagno bought the village. Most of the buildings were demolished, and a [[resort]]-type area was built. Bagno wanted to build something resembling [[Las Vegas]], in the United States. In 1976, there was a [[landslide]], which made the place inaccessible. Consonno, which had been popular, fell into decay. Today, no one lives there. Bagno died in the mid-1990s. Since then there had been different plans to re-populate the place.
