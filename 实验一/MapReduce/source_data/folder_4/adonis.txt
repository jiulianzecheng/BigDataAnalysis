'''Adonis''' was the [[Greek god]] of beauty and desire. His religion belonged to women. 
 Adonis was the [[deity]] of plants. He is known as a god who was forever young, the one who would live and die only to be born again. This cycle is repeated without end. The [[cult]] of Adonis is made up of of women, as it is evident from the 2,600-year-old remains found on the island of [[Lesbos]]. 
 
 [[Athens|Athenian]] women planted the  " garden of Adonis "  where the seeds would spring to life and then die to be reborn a few months later. The festival of Adonis was celebrated in mid-summer when [[fennel]] and [[lettuce]] were harvested. Unfortunately, these plants would wither very quickly and the women would mourn their decline as the death of the youthful Adonis.
