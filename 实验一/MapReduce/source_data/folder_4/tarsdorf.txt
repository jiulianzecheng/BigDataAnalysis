 ==History== 
 Finds in the  < span lang= " de "  dir= " ltr " > Weilhart < /span >  Forest indicate that the  < span lang= " de "  dir= " ltr " > Tarsdorf < /span >  area had already been settled by the [[Neolithic]]. Burial mounds from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] have been discovered. The area was settled by [[Celts]] around 500 BC.  
 
 In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman era]], the road from [[Salzburg]] to [[Burghausen, Altötting|Burghausen]] led through Tarsdorf. It ran through  < span lang= " de "  dir= " ltr " > Hofweiden < /span > ,  < span lang= " de "  dir= " ltr " > Tarsdorf < /span >  and  < span lang= " de "  dir= " ltr " > Hörndl < /span > . The remains of a rustic villa, a millstone, shards of bowls, bricks from an underfloor heating system, pieces of plaster and a silver coin, all dating back to the first four centuries AD, have been discovered between  < span lang= " de "  dir= " ltr " > Hofweiden < /span >  and  < span lang= " de "  dir= " ltr " > Tarsdorf < /span > . 
 
 In the sixth centuries the immigrating Bajuwars, ancestors of today's Bavarians, cleared large parts of the Weilhart-forest.
