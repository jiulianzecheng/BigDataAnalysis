 The '''TGV''' (Train à Grande Vitesse, French for  " high-speed train " ), is a category of high speed [[Railway|trains]]. They are used in [[France]]. They are also used for some [[travel]] between France and [[England]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]. The trains normally travel at speeds between 270 & nbsp;km/h and 320 & nbsp;km/h. They were the fastest normal trains in the world, their average travel speed is at 279,4 & nbsp;km/h. < ref name= " worldspeedsurvey2007 " > {{cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news_view/article/2007/09/7742/new_lines_boost_rails_high_speed_performance.html |title=World Speed Survey: New lines boost rail's high speed performance |date=2007-09-04 |publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]] |accessdate=2009-05-01 |archive-date=2008-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907001541/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news_view/article/2007/09/7742/new_lines_boost_rails_high_speed_performance.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 In 2007, a special TGV set the speed record for rail vehicles, reaching 574,8 & nbsp;km/h. < ref > {{cite web|date=2007-03-04|title=Aboard the fastest TGV in the world|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/article1608769.ece|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-08}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html |title=French train breaks speed record |accessdate=2008-01-10 |last=Associated Press |date=2007-04-04 |work=cnn.com |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407194558/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html |archivedate=2007-04-07 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|author=Fouquet, Helene|last2=Viscousi, Gregory|date=2007-04-03|title=French TGV Sets Record, Reaching 357 Miles an Hour (Update2)|publisher=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085 & sid=aW23Aw20niIo & refer=europe|accessdate=2007-09-19}} < /ref > 
 
 Inside France, there are the following high speed lines 
 * Paris to [[Lyon]], later to [[Valence-sur-Rhône|Valence]], [[Avignon]] and [[Marseille]]. 
 * Paris to [[Tours]] and [[Le Mans]]. Also used to run trains to [[Poitiers]] and [[Bordeaux]]. 
 * Paris to [[Lille]], later [[Brussels]] (known as Thalys) and [[Calais]], [[Dover, Kent|Dover]], [[London]] (known as Eurostar). 
 * Paris to [[Strasbourg]], sometimes to [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Basel]] and [[Zürich City|Zürich]]. The first part of this line has been built. The high-speed track ends at a station, about half-way between [[Nancy]] and [[Metz]]. Strasbourg is currently reachable from Paris is about two and a half hours, Basel takes 3.20, and Zürich about 4.30. The extension of the line to Strasbourg has been started, 
 
 Lines to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] are being planned. A High speed line to [[Germany]] is being built. 
 
 The building of the network has made travel times much shorter. Paris to Marseille (750 & nbsp;km) can now be done in 3 hours. Two thirds of the traffic volume is done by the TGV, only one third is done by [[airplane]]s. 
 
 == TGVs for other uses == 
 Since the beginning of the high-speed rail network, the French [[La Poste (France)|Poste]] uses TGVs to transport [[mail]], mostly  between Paris, [[Mâcon]] and [[Cavaillon]], but the train was retired in 2015. These use the high-speed lines (LGV Sud-Est) during the night. 
 
 In the north of France, the high-speed lines are also used to run regional trains over longer distances. There are currently train  from [[Lille]] to [[Dunkerque]]. This takes half an hour.  Other lines run to [[Calais]], in forty minutes, or to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in 55. In 2007, a line to [[Arras]] was opened, which is also very successful. Unfortunately, there are some problems with this approach. First, only high-speed lines can be used that are not saturated, because these trains run slower than regular TGVs. Secondly, using a TGV line costs more to the client, they have to pay extra. This makes these services more expensive.
