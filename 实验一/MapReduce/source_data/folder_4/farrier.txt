 A '''farrier''' is a person who works with [[iron]], or other materials, to make [[Horseshoe|horseshoes]] and take care of horse's [[hoove]]s. They check for signs of disease and make sure the feet are well cared for.   
 
 ==History== 
 
 At one time, a farrier and [[blacksmith]] had almost the same job, which can be seen by the [[etymology]] of the word: farrier comes from [[Middle French]]: ''ferrier'' ( " blacksmith " ), from the [[Latin]] word ''ferrum'' ( " [[iron]] " ). < ref > [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=farrier & searchmode=none  " Farrier " ] at Etymonline.com < /ref >  Today, farriers usually specialize in horseshoeing, and on the care of the horse's hoof. For this reason farriers and blacksmiths are now known to be different jobs. 
 
 == Law == 
 
 By law, in [[Great Britain]], it is [[illegal]] for anyone except a registered farrier to call themselves a farrier or to carry out any farriery work under the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/35 |title=Farriers (Registration) Act 1975 |work=legislation.gov.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=26 February 2011}} < /ref >  The main aim of this act is to  " prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons " . 
 
 == Worshipful Company of Farriers == 
 The [[Worshipful Company of Farriers]] a [[London Livery Company]], was set up in 1356.  It still offers diplomas which are recognised qualifications to be a modern farrier. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.wcf.org.uk/frequently_asked_questions#Q2 |title=Frequently Asked Questions  & #124; Worshipful Company of Farriers |work=wcf.org.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=26 February 2011}} < /ref >
