 '''Softball''' is a [[sport]] similar to [[baseball]].  Men, women, boys, or girls can play softball.      
 
 There are three types of softball: fastpitch, modified and slow pitch.  In both types of softball, [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitchers]] throw underhand (with hand below shoulder level). 
 
 == How softball is played == 
 There are nine to twelve players per team. The basic goal is to get as many players to [[Run (baseball)|home plate]] as possible. In order to get to home plate, a player usually has to hit the ball.  There are many techniques for hitting (which is called [[Batting (baseball)|batting]]).  There are also different types of [[Bunt|bunts]].   
 
 Once the ball is in play, the batter runs to first base, then waits until the next player hits the ball in order to advance to second base. This keeps on going on until there are three [[Out (baseball)|outs.]]  Then the team on the field goes in to bat, and the team that was up to bat goes to the field.  
 
 == Equipment == 
 '''Ball''': Softballs are not actually soft.  They are larger than [[Baseball (ball)|baseballs]], and weigh about 6.25-7.0[[Ounce|oz]] for fastpitch and 5.87-6.12oz for slowpitch. The ball has a raised seam and is usually yellow or white. The softball was invented in [[Chicago]]. 
 
 '''Gloves''': All defensive players wear [[Baseball glove|gloves]].  The glove is used to catch the ball when it is hit or thrown to the player. The gloves are usually made out of [[leather]] or similar material. The [[catcher]] has a special glove that is extra padded to protect the hand from catching the ball thrown by the pitcher. The [[first baseman]] may have a special glove also.  It has a bigger pocket to catch the ball more easily, because first basemen get the ball thrown to them multiple times during each [[inning]]. 
 
 '''Bat''': The [[Baseball bat|bat]] used by the offense can be made out of wood or aluminum or other composite materials, such as carbon fiber. It cannot be longer than 34 inches long, 6.0 inches in[[diameter]] (length of one side of a circle to the other side), and 38oz in [[mass]]. 
 
 ==Fastpitch  == 
 Fastpitch softball is only for female athletes.  The ages range from five years old to the college or professional level.  
 
 Fastpitch pitching distance can be between 35 and 45 feet; it all depends on the age of the players. The pitches can travel around 60[[Miles per hour|mph]], also depending on the age of the players. The pitcher's arm rotates 360 degrees around her shoulder until the ball is released from the hand.   
 
 ==Slowpitch == 
 Slowpitch softball is for both men and women, usually a sport for adults.  
 
 Slowpitch pitching distance is 50 feet for both male and female players. The pitchers arm motion is a half a windmill, meaning that it is an underhand throw.   
 
 == Softball terms ==
