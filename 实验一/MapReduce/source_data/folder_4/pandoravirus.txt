 '''''Pandoravirus''''' is a [[genus]] of very large [[virus]]es. They have the largest [[genome]]s of any viral genus. < ref name= " Nature " > {{cite journal | last=Yong | first=Ed | doi=10.1038/nature.2014.14801 | title=Giant virus resurrected from 30,000-year-old ice: Nature News  &  Comment | journal=Nature | date=2014 | s2cid=87146458 }} < /ref >  Like the other large viruses ''[[Mimivirus]]'', ''[[Pithovirus]]'' and ''[[Megavirus]]'', ''Pandoravirus'' infects [[amoeba]]s.
