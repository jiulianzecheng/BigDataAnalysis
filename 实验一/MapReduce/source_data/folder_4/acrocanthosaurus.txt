 '''''Acrocanthosaurus''''' was a [[genus]] of [[theropod]] dinosaur that lived in [[North America]] during the [[Lower Cretaceous]] period. Its name means  " high-spined lizard. "  This refers to the spines on its [[vertebrae]], which formed a sail or hump when the animal was alive. 
 
 Its classification is uncertain. It was originally classified as a [[spinosaur]] because the spines on its back looked like those of ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. However, ''Acrocanthosaurus'' is now classified as a [[carnosaur]]. Most paleontologists believe that it was a [[carcharodontosaurid]]. 
 
 ''Acrocanthosaurus'' was 38 feet long, almost as large as ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', and weighed about 6 or 7 [[short ton]]s. It was the largest theropod in North America before the evolution of the [[tyrannosaurs]]. < ref name= " batesetal2009 " > {{cite journal |author=Bates, K.T. |display-authors = etal |year=2009 |editor1-first=Ronald |editor1-last=Beckett|title=Estimating mass properties of dinosaurs using laser imaging and 3D computer modelling |journal=PLOS ONE |pmid=19225569 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pmc=2639725 |pages=e4532 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004532 |quote=We therefore suggest 5750–7250 kg represents a plausible maximum body mass range for this specimen of ''Acrocanthosaurus''. |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4532B|doi-access = free }} < /ref >

 A famous trackway in [[Paluxy, Texas]] shows tracks of what might be an ''Acrocanthosaurus'' and its prey. While interesting and plausible, this [[hypothesis]] is difficult to prove, and other explanations exist. 
 
 == In popular culture == 
 ''Acrocanthosaurus'' was featured in an episode of the television documentary ''[[Monsters Resurrected]]''. It was depicted as the top predator in early Cretaceous North America. A juvenile was scared away from its kill by a pack of ''[[Deinonychus]]'', and was forced to hunt more difficult prey, such as a ''[[Sauropelta]]''.
