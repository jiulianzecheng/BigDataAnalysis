 A '''lysosome''' is a [[cell]] [[organelle]]. < ref > De Duve C. 2005. The lysosome turns fifty. ''Nature Cell Biology'' '''7''' (9): 847â€“9. [http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/v7/n9/full/ncb0905-847.html] < /ref >  They are like spheres and they have [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[enzymes]] which can break down almost all kinds of biomolecules, including [[proteins]], [[nucleic acids]], [[carbohydrates]], [[lipids]], and cellular debris. They contain more than 50 different enzymes. 
 
 By convention, lysosome is the term used for animal cells. < ref > ''Lysosome''. Yale University. [http://medcell.med.yale.edu/histology/keyword.cgi?keyword=lysosome] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030034324/http://medcell.med.yale.edu/histology/keyword.cgi?keyword=lysosome|date=2015-10-30}} < /ref >  In plant cells, [[vacuole]]s do similar functions. With a wider definition, lysosomes are  
 found in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[plant]] and [[protists]] as well as [[animal]] [[cell]].

 Lysosomes work like the [[digestive system]] to break down, or digest, [[protein]]s, [[acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, dead [[organelles]], and other unwanted materials. < ref name= " Lysosome "  / >  They break up larger molecules into smaller molecules. Those smaller molecules can then be used again as building blocks for other large molecules. < ref name= " Lysosome " > {{cite book |title= Edexcel AS Biology Students' Book |url= https://archive.org/details/edexcelasbiology0000unse |last= Fullick |first= Ann  |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-4058-9632-0 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/edexcelasbiology0000unse/page/142 142]-143 }} < /ref > Sometimes, when the cell itself is dying or is dead the lysosomes will eat up the cell. This is why they are also known as 'suicide bags' of cells.
