 '''Helium''' is a [[chemical element]]. It has the [[chemical symbol]] '''He''', [[atomic number]] 2, and atomic weight of about 4.002602. There are 9 [[isotope]]s of helium, only two of which are stable. These are  < sup > 3 < /sup > He and  < sup > 4 < /sup > He.  < sup > 4 < /sup > He is by far the most common isotope. 
 
 Helium is called a [[noble gas]], because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. It has the lowest [[boiling point]] of all the elements. It is the second most common element in the [[universe]], after [[hydrogen]], and has no color or smell. However, helium has a red-orange glow when placed in an electric field. Helium does not usually [[Chemical reaction|react]] with anything else. Astronomers detected the presence of helium in 1868, when its spectrum was identified in light from the [[Sun]]. < ref > Based on this location, its name was derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for Sun, ''helios''. < /ref >  This was before its discovery on [[Earth]]. 
 
 Helium is used to fill [[balloon]]s and [[airship]]s because its [[density]] is lighter than [[air]]. It does not burn, so  is  safe for that kind of use. It is also used in some kinds of [[light]] bulbs. People can breathe in helium: It makes their [[voice]]s sound higher than it normally does. This may seem [[joke|silly]], but it can actually be quite dangerous as if they breathe in too much, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] can injure or kill them as they are not breathing normal air. Breathing too much helium can also cause long-term effects to [[vocal cords]]. 
 
 Helium is created through the process of [[nuclear fusion]] in the Sun, and in similar stars. During this process, two hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one helium atom. On Earth it is made by the natural [[radioactive decay]] of heavy radioactive elements like [[thorium]] and [[uranium]], although there are other examples. The [[alpha particle]]s emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. 
 
 == History == 
 Helium was discovered by the French astronomer [[Jules Janssen|pierre Janssen]] on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line in the [[spectrum]] of the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Kochhar|first=Rajesh|date=2013-04-04|title=Natural history in India during the 18th and 19th centuries|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-013-9316-9|journal=Journal of Biosciences|volume=38|issue=2|pages=201–224|doi=10.1007/s12038-013-9316-9|pmid=23660654|s2cid=26271510|issn=0250-5991|access-date=2020-09-19|archive-date=2022-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526131734/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-013-9316-9|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46984609|title=Nature's building blocks : an A-Z guide to the elements|last=Emsley, John.|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-850341-5|location=Oxford|oclc=46984609|access-date=2020-09-19}} < /ref >  The line was thought to be [[sodium]].

 == Characteristics == 
 Helium is the second least reactive [[noble gas]] after [[neon]]. It is the second least reactive of all elements. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314371890|title=Modeling marvels : computational anticipation of novel molecules|last=Lewars, Errol.|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6973-4|location=[Dordrecht]|oclc=314371890|access-date=2020-09-19}} < /ref >  It is [[chemically inert]] and [[Monatomic gas|monatomic]] in all standard conditions. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Helium is the least [[water]]-[[Solubility|soluble]] monatomic gas. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Ray F.|date=1971|title=Solubility of helium and neon in water and seawater|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/je60049a019|journal=Journal of Chemical  &  Engineering Data|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=235–241|doi=10.1021/je60049a019|issn=0021-9568|via=|access-date=2020-09-19|archive-date=2020-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807225538/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/je60049a019|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 == Uses == 
 Helium is used as a [[shielding gas]] in growing [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] [[crystal]]s, in making [[titanium]] and [[zirconium]], and in [[gas chromatography]], because it is [[Inert gas|inert]]. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61108810|title=CRC handbook of chemistry and physics|date=2005|publisher=CRC Press|others=Lide, David R., 1928-|isbn=0-8493-0486-5|edition=86th ed., 2005-2006|location=Boca Raton|oclc=61108810}} < /ref >  Helium is used as a shielding gas in [[arc welding]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 Helium is mixed with oxygen and other gases for deep [[underwater diving]] because it does not cause [[nitrogen narcosis]]. 
 
 Helium is also used to [[Condensation|condense]] [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to make [[rocket fuel]]. It is used to remove the [[fuel]] and [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] from [[ground support equipment]] before the [[rocket]] launches. It is used to cool [[liquid hydrogen]] in space vehicles before the rocket launches. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 Helium is used as a [[Heat transfer|heat-transfer]] medium in some [[nuclear reactor]]s that are cooled down by [[gas]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56111623|title=Van Nostrand's encyclopedia of chemistry.|others=Considine, Glenn D.|date=3 February 2005|isbn=0-471-61525-0|edition=5th|location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=56111623|access-date=20 September 2020} < /ref >  Helium is also used in some [[hard disk drive]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|date=2013-11-04|title=HGST balloons disk capacity with helium-filled 6TB drive|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/hgst-balloons-disk-capacity-with-helium-filled-6tb-drive/|access-date=2020-09-20|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|archive-date=2017-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707231259/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/hgst-balloons-disk-capacity-with-helium-filled-6tb-drive/|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Helium at low [[temperature]]s is used in [[cryogenics]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2011-07-06|publisher=CERN|title=LHC guide|url=http://visits.web.cern.ch/visits/guides/tools/presentation/LHC_booklet-2.pdf|access-date=2020-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706223231/http://visits.web.cern.ch/visits/guides/tools/presentation/LHC_booklet-2.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-06}} < /ref > 
 
 == Supply == 
 Helium has become rare on Earth. If it gets free into the air it leaves the planet. Unlike [[hydrogen]], which reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[water]], helium is not reactive. It stays as a gas. For many years after the 1925 Helium Act, the USA collected helium in a National Helium Reserve. American helium comes from wells in the [[Great Plains]] area. At present, more helium is supplied by [[Qatar]] than by the USA.

 Several research organisations have released statements on the scarcity and conservation of helium. < ref name= " :6 " > American Physical Society (1995). “National Policy”. https://www.aps.org/policy/statements/95_3.cfm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231103341/https://www.aps.org/policy/statements/95_3.cfm |date=2017-12-31 }} < /ref > < ref name= " :4 "  / >  These organisations released policy recommendations as early as 1995 and as late as 2016 urging the United States government to store and conserve helium because of the natural limits to the helium supply and the unique nature of the element. < ref name= " :6 "  / > < ref name= " :4 "  / >  For researchers, helium is irreplaceable because it is essential for producing very low temperatures. Helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications. Liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for [[superconductivity]], such as in [[superconductivity|superconducting]] [[magnets]] for [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. < ref name= " :4 "   > Epple, Dennis (1982).
