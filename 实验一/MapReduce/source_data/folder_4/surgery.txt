 '''Surgery''' is an operation that involves cutting, taking out, changing or fixing parts of the [[human body]]. [[Medical doctor|Doctor]] < nowiki/ > s who do surgeries are called [[Surgeon|surgeons]]. Many surgeons are experts in certain areas; for example, a surgeon that operates on [[bone]]s is called an orthopaedic surgeon. 
 
 Surgery (operations) can be very simple, like taking a [[tooth]] out. Surgery can also be very complicated, like repairing a damaged [[heart]]. 
 
 Operating rooms have to be very clean places. The doctors and [[nurse]]s go to great lengths to keep the room clean where the surgery is done. Regular cleaning of the room and its tools keeps everything clean and [[Pathogen|germ]]-free. 
 
 Everyone in the operating room must wear special [[clothing|clothes]], [[hat]]s, [[shoe]]s, [[gown]]s, [[glove]]s and [[mask]]s that are clean and germ free. The only people allowed there are the doctors and nurses as well as the [[patient]]. 
 
 When people have operations they are normally put to sleep with general [[anaesthesia]]. When the patients are asleep, they cannot feel anything. In some kinds of surgery local anesthesia (stopping the pain in the place where the cutting is done) is enough. 
 
 In recent years, many patients that cannot get the required surgery in their own country, or find the costs too high, travel to another country for medical care. This is called [[medical tourism]].
