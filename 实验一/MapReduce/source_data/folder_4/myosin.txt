[[File:Myosine.gif|thumb|Part of the myosin II structure]] 
 
 A '''myosin''' is a group of specialized [[protein]]s used for [[Muscle#Muscle contraction|muscle contraction]] and motion in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell]]s. Myosins need [[adenosine triphosphate]] for energy to do these functions. A large number of different myosin [[gene]]s have been discovered in eukaryotes. 
 
 The structure and [[function (biology)|function]] of myosin is strongly conserved across species. For example, Rabbit muscle myosin II will bind to actin from an amoeba. < ref name= " McMahon " > McMahon, T. A. 1984. ''Muscles, reflexes and locomotion'.

 == Structure and function == 
 
 ===Parts=== 
 Most myosin molecules are composed of a [[Myosin head|head]] part, a neck part, and a tail part. 
 * The ''[[Myosin head|head part]]'' grabs onto the [[actin]], and uses energy from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to pull, making the muscle shorter. 
 * the ''neck part'' acts as a lever.   
 * The ''tail part'' mostly interacts with other molecules or other myosin [[protein subunits|subunit]]s. In some cases, the tail part may help regulate movement. 
 
 ===Power stroke=== 
 
 Many myosin molecules can make muscles get shorter using the energy released from breaking apart ATP molecules into [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] molecules and a phosphate group. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Tyska |first1=Matthew J. |last2=Warshaw |first2=David M. |title=The myosin power stroke |journal=Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=1â€“15 |year=2002 |pmid=11810692 |doi=10.1002/cm.10014}} < /ref >  The power stroke happens when a [[phosphate]] that n broken off gets released from the myosin. This makes the myosin change shape so that it pulls against the actin. When the ADP molecule is released and a new ATP molecule joins onto the myosin head, the head releases from the actin. The myosin breaks the new ATP and the cycle keeps going. The combined effect of all the power strokes from all the different myosin molecules makes the muscle get shorter.
