 '''Nottinghamshire''' (abbreviated '''Notts''') is a [[county]] in the [[East Midlands]] of [[England]]. It borders [[South Yorkshire]], [[North Lincolnshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Leicestershire]] and [[Derbyshire]]. The [[county town]] is traditionally [[Nottingham]], at {{coor dms|52|57|17|N|1|09|29|W|}}, though the council is now based in [[West Bridgford]] (at a site facing Nottingham over the [[River Trent]]). 
 
 The districts of Nottinghamshire are [[Ashfield]], [[Bassetlaw]], [[Broxtowe]], [[Gedling]], [[Mansfield (district)|Mansfield]], [[Newark and Sherwood]], and [[Rushcliffe]]. The [[Nottingham|City of Nottingham]] was administratively part of Nottinghamshire between 1974 and 1998 but is now a [[Unitary authorities in England|unitary authority]], although it remains part of the county.
