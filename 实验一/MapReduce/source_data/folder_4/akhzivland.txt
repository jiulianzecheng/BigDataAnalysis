 '''Akhzivland''' is a [[micronation]] between [[Nahariya]] and the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] border on the [[Israel]]i west coast. The state was founded by Eli Avivi in 1972. The micronation is promoted by the [[Israel Ministry of Tourism]] even though its legal status remains debated. < ref > {{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Colin|title=A World of His Own: Eli Avivi|url=http://www.goworldtravel.com/travel-israel-a-world-of-his-own-eli-avivi/|website=Go World Travel|date=7 January 2013 |access-date=10 March 2015}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=John|title=Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide to Home-Made Nations|url=https://archive.org/details/micronationsthel0000ryan|date=2006|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn=1741047307|pages=[https://archive.org/details/micronationsthel0000ryan/page/48 48]–50}} < /ref > 
 
 The micronation is located near the ruins of [[Achziv]], an ancient settlement on the Mediterranean coast in the Western Galilee, about 5 kilometers north of Nahariya.  
 
 A national park, field school, and the ruins of the Palestinian village of [[Az-Zeeb]], which was captured by the [[Carmeli Brigade]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], are located nearby.
