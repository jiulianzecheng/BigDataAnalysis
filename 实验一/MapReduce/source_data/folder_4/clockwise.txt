 [[File:Gegenuhrzeigersinn.png|thumb|left|The counterclockwise or anticlockwise direction]] 
 A '''clockwise''' [[movement]] is one that moves in a [[circle]] ''like the [[clock]]'s hands'': from the top to the right, then down, then to the left, and back to the top. 
 
 The [[Antonym|opposite]] of clockwise is '''counterclockwise''' or '''anticlockwise'''. The movement is from the top to the left, then down, then to the right, and finally back up to the top.
