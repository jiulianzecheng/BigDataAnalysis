'''Robosexuality''' is where a person is [[sex]]ually attracted to machines, such as [[robot]]s. The word  " robosexuality "  comes from combining the words  " [[robot]] "  and  " [[sexual]] " .  Robosexuality is different from mechanophilia and technosexuality, but they can still be interconnected. A person who is sexually attracted to robots can be referred to as a robosexual. A person who is robosexual may have different gender preferences than another person who is  " Robosexual " .  
 
 Robosexuality can be used an umbrella term to describe the sexual attraction to robots of any kind, whether they are humanlike or not. Many prefer a robot with conscience and emotion, or even the illusion of it.

 === Robosexuality in the East === 
 Roughly 50% of all the [[robots]] in the world are in [[Asia]], 32% in [[Europe]], and 16% in [[North America]], 1% in [[Australia]] and 1% in [[Africa]]. 
 
 40% of all robots in the world are found in [[Japan]]. < ref > Reporting by Watanabe, Hiroaki; Writing and additional reporting by Negishi, Mayumi; Editing by Norton, Jerry;[https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUST32811820071202 Japan's robots slug it out to be world champ]; Reuters; 2007-12-02; retrieved on 2007-01-01 < /ref > 
 
 In [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], ideas of future robots have been mainly positive. The number of robots in Japan means more people in Japan are likely to have a love of gadgets. [[Manga]] and [[anime]] series in both countries often show love or sex between robots and humans. This would mean more robosexuality. 
 
 Japanese religious beliefs allow the idea that robots have souls. < ref name=Biglione > Biglione, Kirk; [http://www.planettokyo.com/news/index.cfm/fuseaction/story/ID/36/ The Secret To Japan's Robot Dominance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621045153/http://www.planettokyo.com/news/index.cfm/fuseaction/story/ID/36 |date=2009-06-21 }}; Planet Tokyo; 2006-01-24; retrieved on 2007-01-02 < /ref >  This also makes the idea of love between humans and robots more acceptable or ordinary. 
 
 === Robosexuality in the West === 
 The idea of physical sexuality is less accepted in the west than in Japan. Western societies are more likely to be against, or even fear the development of robots. This is because a lot of films and books show robots as replacing humans instead of helping them. 
 
 'RealDoll' is a life-size sex-doll sold in America, that can be sold with robotic implants. People who feel sexually attracted, or have sex with these, are robosexual. However, one important thing to notice is that this American machine does not move and think by itself, unlike their Japanese and South Korean counterparts.
