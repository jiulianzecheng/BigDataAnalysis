According to the [[Bible]], '''Ashkenaz''' was the grandson of [[Japhet]], [[Noah]]'s oldest son. 
 
 He was first thought to have been the ancestor of the [[Scythians]], but later [[Jews]] thought he was the ancestor of the peoples of [[Western Europe]], especially [[Germany]]. So the Jews who settled in Western Europe took on the name [[Ashkenazi Jews]] after him.{{Religion-stub}}
