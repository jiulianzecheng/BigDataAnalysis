 A '''griot'''{{efn|A female griot was called a griottess. < ref name=Alexander48/ > }} or '''Jeli''' is a [[West Africa]]n [[historian]], storyteller, [[musician]], [[genealogy|genealogist]], [[spokesperson]], [[diplomat]], [[teacher]], praise-singer{{efn|A praise-singer is also called an ''imbongi''.

Not every griot does all these things, but these are some [[example]]s of what their function is. < ref name=BucknellU/ >   
 
 == Their role == 
 A griot was a [[civil servant|public servant]], an [[artist]], and a [[royal]] [[counselor]]. < ref name=Juang482 > ''Africa and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'', Volume 3, eds. Richard M Juang; Noelle Morrissette (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2008), p. 482 < /ref >  His [[fate]] depended on the [[prosperity]] and [[wikt:survival|survival]] of the [[king]] or [[queen]] he served. He preserved the [[oral history]] of his [[tribe]] or people. In the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Americas]] he was the link to their African [[culture]] and history. < ref name=Juang482/ >  The griot was the only person that could keep their past history in Africa alive. [[Troubadour]] and [[poet]], diplomat and [[divine]]r only begin to describe his functions. Each [[clan]], [[village]], and [[warrior]]-family had a griot. < ref name=Alexander48 > ''Encyclopedia of African American History'', ed. Leslie Alexander (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010), p. 48 < /ref >  They kept track of all [[birth]]s, [[marriage]]s, deaths, [[battle]]s and other tribal histories. Griots were also said to have the ability to see one's future. < ref name=Alexander48/ >  They could memorize the history of every member of a clan or tribe going back for [[centuries]]. < ref name=Alexander48/ > 
 
 == Who could become a griot == 
 The position of a griot was [[traditionally]] passed down from father to son. < ref name=BucknellU/ >  A griot was born into and trained by a griot family. < ref name=Brown174 > ''The Routledge Companion to Actors' Shakespeare'', eds. John Russell Brown; Kevin Ewert (London; New York: Routledge, 2012), p. 174 < /ref >  For those not born into griot families, sometimes there was a master griot who taught the arts associated with the position. < ref name=BucknellU/ >  Today there are [[state]]-[[sponsor]]ed and [[private school]]s that teach griot arts. But they focus on the musical aspects and not the verbal skills. < ref name=BucknellU/ >
