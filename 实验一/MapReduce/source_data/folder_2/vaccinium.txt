 '''''Vaccinium''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plants]]. All of them are [[shrub]]s in the family [[Ericaceae]]. The fruits of ''Vaccinium'' [[species]] include [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[huckleberry|huckleberries]], and [[Bilberry]]. 
 
 In total, there are about 450 species, mostly in the cooler parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. There are a few tropical species which grow in places like [[Madagascar]] or [[Hawaii]]. The plants usually grow in [[heathland]]s or in [[forest]]s. Like most plants of the [[Ericaceae]], many species grow in [[acid]]ic [[soil]]s.  
 
 The [[larva]]e of a number of [[lepidoptera]] species ([[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]] are examples of lepidoptera) grow on these plants. 
 
 == Modern research == 
 The [[taxonomy]] of the genus is complex, and is being investigated. [[Genetic analysis]] shows that the genus ''Vaccinium'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. < ref name= " kron " > {{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/89/2/327 | title = Phylogenetic relationships within the blueberry tribe (Vaccinieae, Ericaceae) based on sequence data from MATK and nuclear ribosomal ITS regions, with comments on the placement of ''Satyria'' | author = Kathleen A.
