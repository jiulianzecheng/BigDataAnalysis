 The '''Nambudiri''', also transliterated '''Nambūdiri''', '''Namboodiri''', '''Namboothiri''', and '''Nampūtiri''', are a [[Malayali Brahmin]] caste, native to what is now the state of [[Kerala]], India. 
 
 As the traditional feudal elite, Nambudiris owned a large portion of the land in the region of Malabar until the [[Land reform in Kerala|Kerala Land Reforms]] starting in 1957. < ref > {{cite journal | title=Land Reforms in Theory and Practice: The Kerala Experience| first=Radhakrishnan |last=P.| journal=Economic and Political Weekly | date=December 1981| volume=16| issue=52 | pages=A129–A137 |jstor=4370526}} < /ref >  Nambudiris have been noted for their unique practices such as the adherence to [[Śrauta|srauta]] ritualism and orthodox tradition. < ref > {{cite journal| title=The Turning-Point in a Living Tradition somayāgam 2003| first1=Mahadevan| last1=T.P.| first2=Staal| last2=Fritz| journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies| date=2003| volume=10| issue=1| pages=No 1 (2003): Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies| doi=10.11588/ejvs.2003.1.743| url=http://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/view/743| access-date=2020-12-04| archive-date=2020-10-23| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023194901/https://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/view/743| url-status=dead}} < /ref >  [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] mentions that the dominating influence of the Nambudiris was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture of Kerala. < ref name=Pullapilly1976pp26-30/ > 
 
 Nambudri Documentalist Advocate Jayaprakash Mallay. Awestruck by the nature and content of sahyadri khanda version of the skanda purana, I took courage to redefine Nambudri origins from the chaos of history's bizzare chess game with learned history scholars from National conferences like IHC and SIHC during 1999 - 2006 at various academic venues and enclaves. But their deafening silence prompted me to trigger this issue with Nambudri Brahmin scholars from Karikkad whose residence I shared in the early eighties. Emboldened by Nambudiries well versed in the Scriptures who narrated to me with pin point precision and stunning accuracy on an insider's expose about Nambudri Material Culture and Life Cycle Ritual, I came to the conclusion Nambudries have a shared heritage with Nalillacaran fishermen in Kerala. It is fortuitous fate that led me to take up residence at Puthan Mana, Pulikkathodi Illam and Moothedath Palasseri Mana all in the traditional Nambudri Village of Karikkad during 1983 - 1990 phase. As a participant observer I was appointed Registration Officer during Nambudri social gatherings called swajana sangamam consequently from 1997 - 2001 period. It all resulted in the production of my print media book Malayala Brahmin Autochthon Theory in the year 1995. The book was subjected to Tuesday Open Page Book Review in The Hindu.

 Brahmin presence in the Tamil country is attested from the [[Sangam period|Sangam]] period onward. Based on the fact that Nambudiris are Pūrvaśikhā Brahmins wearing the traditional hair tuft on the front, T.P Mahadevan proposes that they are the descendants of these Sangam age Brahmins who moved west into the region of Malabar during the [[Kalabhra dynasty|Kalabhra]] interregnum. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Mahadevan|first=Thennilapuram P.|date=2016-01-29|title=On the Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata, Brahman Migrations, and Brāhmī Paleography|url=http://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/view/327|journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=4|doi=10.11588/ejvs.2008.2.327|issn=1084-7561|access-date=2020-12-04|archive-date=2022-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126165922/https://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/article/view/327|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alf|title=Introducing the Mahābhārata|journal=Religious Studies Review|year=2015|volume=41:4|issue=4|pages=153–174|doi=10.1111/rsr.12271}} < /ref >  This sets them apart from the later Aparaśikhā Brahmin (wearing their hair tufts on the back) migrants to South India such as the Tamil [[Iyer]]s.

 Anthropologists Heike Moser and Paul Younger note that the Nambudiri Brahmin presence predates the 9th century, as attested by grants of land given to them by ruling families. < ref name= " moseryounger "  / >  According to the historian [[Romila Thapar]], local kings and chiefs encouraged them to move to the area by offering such tax-exempt land grants in return for them officiating in Vedic rites that would legitimise the grantors' status as rulers. < ref name= " collins " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v39x_fKR-ykC & pg=PA305|title=Weberian Sociological Theory|last=Collins|first=Randall|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-52131-426-8|page=305|author-link=Randall Collins}} < /ref >  They also gained land and improved their influence over the socio-economic life of the region by helping rulers during the wars between the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] and Chera dynasties when Vedic schools were turned into military academies. < ref name= " shanmugam " > {{cite journal|last=Shanmugam|first=S.

 ===Early history=== 
 Operating from their ''[[illam]]'' houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the [[janmi]] system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they  " established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste " . The Nambudiris have been described to be responsible for the Sanskrit influence on [[Malayalam]], basically a Dravidian language, due to the Nambudiri Brahmin's mixing of [[Sanskrit]] and the local [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language. < ref name= " moseryounger "  / > < ref name= " Pullapilly1976pp26-30 " > {{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNAI9F8IBOgC |title=Religion and Social Conflict in South Asia |volume=22 |series=International studies in sociology and social anthropology |editor-first=Bardwell L. |editor-last=Smith |publisher=E.

 ===Modern history=== 
 The unwillingness of Nambudiris to adapt to changes in wider society persisted until the early years of the 20th century but [[Susan Bayly]] believes that their decline in significance can be traced to the period 1729-1748 when [[Marthanda Varma]] established the [[Kingdom of Travancore]] and chose to use [[Deshastha Brahmin]]s from [[Tamil Nadu]] in his civil service. She believes that decision undermined the relationship between the Nambudiri Brahmins and royalty in the region, although others have said that Varma's influence was short-lived and that the main cause of change was the arrival of British colonial administrators, such as [[Colin Macaulay]] and [[John Munro, 9th of Teaninich|John Munro]], from the early 1800s. After the passing of the Charter Acts of 1833 and 1853 in the British Parliament, the British encouraged the work of Christian missionaries, notably in provision of education, and began the introduction of a judicial system that would have a significant impact on the landholdings, inheritance customs and marriage arrangements of both the Nambudiris and Nairs. The traditional basis of life was challenged by these and other changes, affecting also the other major ethnic groups of the area, such as the [[Ezhava]]s and the [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]]s. < ref name= " moseryounger " / >

 # Rigveda, the ''Śākala'' recension which is the only extant recension of the Rigveda across India. The Nambudiris follow both the  ''Āśvalāyana'' and ''Śāṅkhāyana'' [[Srauta Sutras|Śrauta Sūtras]]. The latter, called the Kauṣītaki tradition among Nambudiris is restricted to them.

 ===Agnicayana=== 
 The ancient Vedic ritual of [[Agnicayana]] (the altar of fire), which spans a 12-day period and which [[Frits Staal]] and Robert Gardner claim to be one of the oldest known rituals, was maintained by Nambudiri Brahmins until at least 1975.

 ===Marriage customs=== 
 Nambudiri Brahmin families practised a more strict version of [[primogeniture]] than Brahmin communities elsewhere in India. Under this custom, only the eldest son could marry a Nambudiri woman and thus produce an heir to the family property. Younger sons were restricted to [[sambandham|sambandam]] relationships with non-Brahmin women, whom the Nambudiris considered to be concubines and whose offspring could not inherit. < ref > {{cite book |title=Weberian Sociological Theory |first=Randall |last=Collins |author-link=Randall Collins |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-52131-426-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v39x_fKR-ykC & pg=PA300 |pages=300–301}} < /ref >  This tradition limited the extent of marriage within their own caste and led to the practice of hypergamy with the Nair community. [[Kathleen Gough]] notes that:{{quote|These hypergamous unions were regarded by Brahmans as socially acceptable [[concubinage]], for the union was not initiated with Vedic rites, the children were not legitimized as Brahmans, and neither the woman nor her child was accorded the rights of kin. By the matrilineal castes, however, the same unions were regarded as marriage, for they fulfilled the conditions of ordinary Nayar marriage and served to legitimize the child as an acceptable member of his matrilineal lineage and caste. " < ref > {{cite book |title=Matrilineal Kinship |editor1-first=David Murray |editor1-last=Schneider |editor2-first=E. Kathleen |editor2-last=Gough |chapter=Nayars: Central Kerala |first=E.

 The disparity in caste ranking in a relationship between a Brahmin man and a Nair woman meant that the woman was unable to live with her husband(s) in the Brahmin family and so remained in her own family. The children resulting from such marriages always became Nairs. [[K. M. Panikkar]] argues that it is this type of relationship that resulted in the matrilineal and [[matrilocal]] system. < ref > {{cite journal | title=Some Aspects of Nayar Life| first=Kavalam Madhava |last=Panikkar| journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute| date=July–December 1918| volume=48 |url=https://archive.org/stream/SomeAspectsOfNayarLife/SomeAspectsOfNayarLifeCopy#page/n0/mode/2up |author-link=Kavalam Madhava Panikkar |access-date=2011-06-09 |page=265}} < /ref >  It has also been argued that the practice, along with judicious selection of the man who tied the ''thali'', formed a part of the Nair aspirational culture whereby they would seek to improve their status within the caste. Furthermore, that: {{quote|... among the higher-ranking Nayars (and Kshatriyas and Samantans) in contradistinction to the  " commoner "  Nayars, no two subdivisions admitted to equal status. Thus the relations set up by the tali-rite [ie: the ''[[Kettu Kalyanam|thalikettu kalyanam]]''] and the sambandham union were always hypergamous. < ref name= " fuller " > {{cite journal |title=The Internal Structure of the Nayar Caste |first=Christopher John |last=Fuller |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=283–312 |date=Winter 1975 |doi=10.1086/jar.31.4.3629883 |jstor=3629883 |s2cid=163592798 }} < /ref > |sign=|source=}} 
 
 Although it is certain that in theory hypergamy can cause a shortage of marriageable women in the lowest ranks of a caste and promote upwards social movement from the lower Nair subdivisions, the numbers involved would have been very small. It was not a common practice outside the higher subcaste groups and the Nambudiris had mostly stopped the practice by the 1920s. < ref name= " fuller " / >

 The form of Sanskrit theatre known as [[Koodiyattam]], which is native to Kerala, was traditionally patronised by Nambudiris.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
