The males, are mostly larger than the female. Adults have a long, dark bill, pale yellowish eyes, and a long tail; their [[Feather|feathers]] appear black with purple, green, or blue on the head, and primarily brown shine on the body. Adult females, besides being smaller, are less shiny; their tails in particular are shorter, and are brown with no purple or blue shine. Juveniles are brown with dark brown eyes.
