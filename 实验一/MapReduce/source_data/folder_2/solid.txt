 '''Solid''' is one of the four common [[states of matter]]. The [[molecules]] in solids are closely bound together, so they can only vibrate. This means solids have a definite shape that only changes when a [[Force (physics)|force]] is applied. This is different to [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es which move randomly, a process called [[Flux|flow]].  
 
 Solids can resist forces applied to their surface.  
 
 When a solid becomes a [[liquid]], this is called [[melt]]ing. [[Liquids]] become solid by [[freezing]]. Some solids, like [[dry ice]], can turn into gas without turning liquid first. This is called [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. 
 
 == Kinds of solids == 
 The [[Force (physics)|forces]] between the [[atom]]s in a solid can take many forms. For example, a [[crystal]] of [[sodium chloride]] (common [[salt]]) is made up of [[ion]]ic [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]], which are held together by [[ionic bond]]s. In [[diamond]] or [[silicon]], the atoms share [[electron]]s and make [[covalent bond]]s. In [[metal]]s, electrons are shared in [[metallic bond]]ing. Some solids, like most [[Organic chemistry|organic]] compounds, are held together with  " van der Waals forces "  coming from the [[polarization]] of the electronic charge [[cloud]] on each [[molecule]]. The dissimilarities between the types of solid come from the differences between their bonding. 
 
 === Metals ===

 Most metals are strong, dense, and good [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] of [[electricity]] and [[Heat conduction|heat]]. The [[mass]] of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the [[periodic table]], those to the left of a diagonal line drawn from [[boron]] to [[polonium]], are metals. Mixtures of two or more elements in which the big component is a metal are known as [[alloy]]s. 
 
 People have been using metals for many purposes since [[prehistoric]] times. 
 The strength and relialbility of metals has led to their widespread use in making of buildings and other things, as well as in most [[vehicle]]s, many [[tool]]s, [[pipe]]s, [[road]] [[sign]]s and [[railroad track]]s. [[Iron]] and [[aluminium]] are the two most commonly used metals. They are also the most common metals in the [[Earth's crust]]. Iron is most commonly used in the form of an alloy, [[steel]], which has up to 2.1% [[carbon]], making it much harder than pure iron. 
 
 Since metals are good conductors of electricity, they are [[wikt:valuable|valuable]] in [[electrical]] tools and for carrying an electric [[Electric current|current]] over long [[distance]]s with little [[energy]] loss. Because of this, electrical power grids rely on metal [[cable]]s to get electricity. Home electrical [[system]]s, for example, are [[wire]]d with [[copper]] for its good conducting uses. The high [[thermal conductivity]] of most metals also makes them useful for stovetop cooking [[utensil]]s. 
 
 === Minerals ===

 [[Mineral]]s are natural solids formed through many [[Geology|geological]] processes and having a crystal structure with uniform [[Matter|physical]] things throughout..
