 '''Dill''' (''Anethum graveolens'') is a short-lived [[annual plant|annual]] [[herb]] that is often used as a [[spice]], to make food taste better by adding a unique, slightly tangy flavor that goes well with savory foods.   
 
 ==Uses== 
 [[File:Dill seed tilli siemen.jpg|thumb|left|Dried seeds]] 
 Fresh and dried dill leaves (sometimes called  " dill weed "  to distinguish it from dill seed) are used as [[herb]]s. 
 
 Like [[caraway]], its fernlike leaves are aromatic, and are used to flavor many [[food]]s, such as [[gravlax]] (pickled [[salmon]]), [[borscht]] and other [[soup]]s, [[cream cheese]] and [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]]s. Dill is said to be best when used fresh, as it lose its flavor rapidly if dried; however, [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] dill leaves preserve their flavor relatively well for a few months. 
 
 Dill seed is used as a [[spice]], with a flavor similar to caraway. 
 
 Dill oil can be extracted from the leaves, stems and seeds of the plant.
