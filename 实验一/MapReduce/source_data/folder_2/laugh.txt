 A '''laugh''' is a way of showing happiness. It is a  [[vocal]] [[sound]] which a person makes when something is [[humor|funny]], like a [[joke]], or a [[tickle]]. 
 
 Sometimes people laugh when they are not happy. When people are ashamed or embarrassed, sometimes they react by laughing. 
 
 There are different ways to laugh. A person can laugh using mostly their voice, mostly their throat, or mostly their nose. 
 
 You can write a laugh in different ways. Some people write  " ha ha ha " , or  " he he he " , or  " hehe " . If they are on the internet, they also use  " LOL " .  " LOL "  does not sound like a laugh, but it stands for '''L'''aughing '''O'''ut '''L'''oud. 
 
 Human babies first laugh at the age of around three or four months, usually as an expression of surprise. Babies' laughter often produces a positive response in adults who will involuntarily copy the child. Video footage, on the [[YouTube]] site, of babies laughing was shown to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] during her visit, on 16 October 2008, to the [[Google]] headquarters, where both she and her husband the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] were reduced to 'fits of giggles'. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/3210566/Queen-visits-Google---and-is-amused-by-YouTube-video-of-laughing-baby-boy.html|title=Queen visits google and is amused by laughing child|access-date=2018-04-01|archive-date=2009-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204143941/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/3210566/Queen-visits-Google---and-is-amused-by-YouTube-video-of-laughing-baby-boy.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
