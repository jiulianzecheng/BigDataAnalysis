'''Monophyly''' means common descent from a single ancestor. 
 [[Biologist]]s have introduced  a kind of [[taxonomy]] called [[cladistics]]. The aim of this is to make biological classification fit what we know about the way organisms [[evolution|evolved]]. 
 
 If there is a group made of a common [[ancestor]], and all its descendants, that group is '''monophyletic'''. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford University Press, 285. {{ISBN|0-19-530761-5}} < /ref > < ref > Futuyma, Douglas J. 2005. ''Evolution''. Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts, 45. {{ISBN|0-87893-187-2}} < /ref >   ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]:  " of one race " ). 
 
 A group which contains organisms, without their common ancestor, is called '''[[polyphyletic]]'''. [[Convergent evolution]] is a usual cause of such groups. If a group contains the common ancestor, but leaves out some of its descendants, it is called '''[[paraphyletic]]'''. All living things on this [[planet]] are thought, on the basis of [[DNA]] analysis, to be monophyletic, that is, to have one origin, not many.

 Example: all species in the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' have come from the same ancestral form in the family [[Hominidae]], and no other descendants are known. Thus the [[genus]] ''Homo'' is monophyletic. 
 
 If, on the other hand, it were discovered that ''[[Homo habilis]]'' had developed from a different ancestor from ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', and this ancestor were not included in the genus, then the genus would be polyphyletic. Since [[biologist]]s by and large tend to prefer monophyletic groups, in this case, they would likely either split the genus or broaden it to include the additional forms. 
 
 Example of polyphyletic group: [[Sea slug]]s. 
 
 == Polyploidy == 
 Sometimes taxonomists are frustrated fitting plant species into a monophyletic group because of [[polyploidy]]. There is clear evidence that some polyploid plant species are of multiple origins (the species has arisen more than once). For example, ''Salsify'', the hybrid goat's-beard, (''Tragopogon miscellus'') has formed as many as 20 times in eastern [[Washington]]. < ref > Colin Tudge 2000. ''The variety of life''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198604262}}. < /ref > 
 
 Also, it can happen that [[hybrid]]s between two close plant species undergo polyploidy, and the polyploids continue as a new and distinct species. Situations like this are outside the normal rules of descent, and are dealt with by special decisions, guided by the International Commission of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN).
