 The '''Colognian dialect''', or '''Kölsch''' is a variety of the [[German language]]. People in and around the city of [[Cologne]] in the West of [[Germany]] use Kölsch. Nowadays most of them have [[High German]] as their [[primary language]] or [[secondary language]]. 
 
 == Usage == 
 About 250,000 people actively speak Kölsch. 
 More than 2,500,000 people understand Kölsch well and use some Kölsch, or a variant, somehow. 
 An estimated 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 people understand it partially. 
 
 == Pronunciation == 
 How to say  " Kölsch " ? Take the beginning from  " kernel "  or  " colonel " ; next take a real dark, long  " l "  as in  " bold " , or  " ball " ; then append a  " sh "  as in  " shrimps " , or  " ti "  as in  " nation " . That's the sound  " Kölsch " . However, the German  " ö "  is not exactly the same as an English  " o " , but a sound between  " o "  and  " e " . 
 
 === Etymology === 
 The word 'Kölsch' comes from the Name of the City of Cologne. It is 'Köln' in native tongue, yet 'Kölle' in Kölsch. By ordinary German word building rules, 'kölnisch' means 'belonging to Cologne', 'related to Cologne', 'in Cologne', 'from Cologne'—as in 'kölnisch Wasser' (''[[Eau de Cologne]]''). The word 'kölnisch', or 'köllesch', shortened to 'kölsch' in local tongue, became a shorthand noun for the [[Kölsch (beer)|local beer]] and the local language, or dialect. 
 
 Today's name of the city stems from ancient times of the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] of Northern Germany 100 years before Christ, and later. The Romans built a [[fort]] or [[castle]] —then, approximately under the reign of [[Julius Caesar]], turned  it into a colony ([[Latin]]: ''colonia'') with religious and city rights. Part of its Roman name stuck, 'Colonia Clavdia Ara Agrippinensivm Oppidvm Vbiorum' became 'Köln' over the centuries. 
 
 === History === 
 Although Kölsch speakers occasionally claim that it is rooted in pre-Roman times, Kölsch developed from a mix of [[Lower German]] and [[Middle High German]] in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times. It learned from other languages through political and trade connections during the times of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]], and from various waves of immigration. In modern times, there were: 
 * Remarkable [[French language|French]] influences since [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s occupation of the city ([[1794]]-[[1815]]) 
 * Prussian influences as Prussian kings took over from the French army 
 * [[Dutch language|Dutch]] influences by immigration, trade, and neighborhood 
 * Some [[English language|English]] influences through the [[British]] and [[United States|American]] armies, [[European integration]] and worldwide [[globalization]] since [[1945]] 
 * Recently minor influences by migrants from Southern [[Europe]] and [[Turkey]] start evolving 
 
 === Special properties === 
 Kölsch has outstanding or unique properties. Here are some: 
 * Richness. There is only one language in Europe that has as many different vowels as Kölsch. There are a huge number of different sounds that sound like 'sh', but if someone gets them wrong, he will be understood as a foreigner. 
 * Tolerance paired with individuality. Kölsch is not so outstanding among the many dialects around it. These are both similar and different. Kölsch integrates new variants and deviations easily and quickly. There is no concept of right or wrong, only of difference. It is all right to be different, as every individual is different somehow all the time. 
 * Kölsch is unusually well documented. Some linguists of the local universities have shown great interest in Kölsch and other local dialects, and research on them. Outside the world of science, the [[Akademie för uns Kölsche Sproch]] (''Academy in favour of our Kölsch language'') offers regular courses, classes, excursions for everybody. They publish a dictionary, a grammar, and phrase books. It is probably the only institute of its kind in the world. 
 
 === Socio-cultural === 
 After the Second World War, Cologne took up and integrated a huge number of former inhabitants from the former East German regions, which now are part of Poland. That has not had a big impact on the Kölsch language; but it has on the immigrants. They soon began to integrate into the social life and otherwise, they began to learn Kölsch. Naturally they were not perfect speakers at first. The Kölsch language recognized that, and quickly created a word for them:  " imi "  ('imitating' or 'imitated' Kölsch). As they learned Kölsch well over the years, you could hear the word 'imi' less often. It came back when the wall that separated East and West Germany was taken down.

The professional musicians, successful in other projects, just for fun recorded a nice Kölsch song together, in [[1969]]. The record became a little local success. Over the years, they had a series of local top hits, occasionally well received even outside the area where people understand Kölsch. Today they draw audiences of 20,000 or 30,000 people several times a year. Their repertoire covers most styles of modern popular music, and various language variants of Kölsch.

If there is voice in their compositions, it is mostly used similar to any other instrument.
