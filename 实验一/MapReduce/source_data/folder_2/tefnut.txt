 '''Tefnut''' was the ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[goddess]] of [[water]] and [[fertility]]. She and her brother and husband, [[Shu (god)|Shu]], were created by [[Atum]], [[Ra]] or [[Amun]]. Tefnut was the mother of [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] and [[Geb]] also she is associated with the [[lion]]. In [[art]] she is represent as a [[woman]] with [[head]] of the lion with [[Sun]] disc. 
 
 == God's plan == 
 
 Tefnut, along with [[Shu]], were the first deities created by [[Ra]]. She had other names, such as Tefenet and Tefnet. She was mainly in charge of [[moisture]], but was also responsible for [[Order]], [[Time]], [[Justice]], [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]. She was very closely related to both the [[sun]] and the [[moon]]. She was known as both the left (moon), and right (sun): 'Eyes of Ra.' 
 
 == Physical description == 
 
 Once Tefnut fled from [[Ra]] as a lioness, causing a great drought. Only [[Thoth]] could persuade her to return, so he went to [[Nubia]] and got her back. When she got back, there was great rejoice in all the temples.  After that incident, Tefnut, normally wearing her fathers’ sun disk, was seen as a [[lioness]], or a woman with a lions’ head. Very rarely ever again was she seen portrayed as a full woman. When Tefnut was in the [[royal court]], she wore a crown made of sprouting plants. Sometimes she was seen lying horizontally between the ground and the sky. She was sometimes pictured with her husband, [[Shu (god)|Shu]], helping to hold up [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]. She cried with the pain, and when she cried, that made the ground fertilized. 
 
 == Power  &  magic == 
 
 Tefnut sat in judgment of the dead in the underworld. Tefnut wears her fathers’ sun disk, a symbol of power. She carries a [[scepter]] and wears an [[ankh]], the symbol of life. As she was the [[goddess]] of [[moisture]], she was also related to other deities of moisture and wetness. She was seen holding up the sky with her brother/husband [[Shu]]. As she was in charge of moisture, she held other roles as well. Some of them were: [[Order]], [[justice]], [[time]], the [[weather]],[[Heaven]], and [[Hell]]. Above all, her main role was to bring moisture down on the [[ancient Egyptians.]] 
 
 == Worship == 
 
 Tefnut was worshipped in lion form in Leontopolis (May-ta-hut). Part of the city of Denderah (Iunet), was known as ‘[[The House of Tefnut]].’ Some of Tefnut’s festival dates were the 20th of August, the day of satisfying the Hearts of the [[Ennead]]. Another festival date was the 29th of [[October]], which was the day of Going Forth of Het-Hert and the Ennead. The last festival date was the 15th of November, the Ennead Feast in the House of Kay Heru and Wasir. Tefnut does not have any main centers of [[Worship]], or any known temples dedicated to her.
