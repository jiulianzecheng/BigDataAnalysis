 The '''ocelot''' (''Leopardus pardalis'') is a small [[mammal]], one of nine [[species]] in the genus ''[[Leopardus]]''. 
 
 Normally it lives in [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], as far up as [[Mexico]]. It has been reported as far north as [[Texas]] and in [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], in the [[Caribbean]]. These fast cats eat small [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], and [[snake]]s. They are very good swimmers. 
 
 Once hunted for its beautiful [[fur]], the cat is now protected and listed as 'least concern' by the IUCN Red List. The cat is [[nocturnal]] and likes [[forest]]s and dense vegetation. It is very territorial, and will fight to keep its territory. Like many cats, male ocelots mark their territory by spraying [[urine]]. 
 
 Their kittens grow slowly, staying with their mother for up to two years. They have to learn how to catch [[prey]] before they can be independent. 
 
 Although a  " small cat " , it is a good deal bigger than the others. The ocelot ranges from {{convert|68|to|100|cm}} in length, plus {{convert|26|to|45|cm|in|sp=us}} in tail length, and typically weighs {{convert|8|to|18|kg|lb}}. Larger ones have been reported. < ref name= " Animal " > Burnie, David  &  Don E. Wilson 2001. ''Animal: the definitive visual guide to the world's wildlife''. New York City: Dorling Kindersley.
