The '''Palaeogene''' (meaning “old generation” in Greek) is the first [[geology|geological]] [[Period (geology)|period]] of the [[Cainozoic]] and the tenth period in the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]]. It began 65 [[million]] years ago, and ended 23 million years ago. < ref > http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf < /ref >  Before it was the [[Cretaceous]]. The Palaeogene was followed by the [[Neogene]]. 
 
 The Palaeogene had three stages: [[Palaeocene]], [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]]. 
 
 The Palaeogene and the succeeding [[Neogene]] were originally considered to be one period, the [[Tertiary]], until it was split recently . 
 
 == Climate == 
 The climate was warmer than today. The world was largely forested, and the larger land animals were [[Browser|browsers]], not [[Grazer|grazers]]. [[Grass|Grasses]] existed, but they had not yet become the dominant ecology they became later. The change to a modern climate came in the [[Miocene]] period, which started off like the Paleogene, but changed towards a modern-type ecology with less rainfall and widespread [[Grassland|grasslands]].
