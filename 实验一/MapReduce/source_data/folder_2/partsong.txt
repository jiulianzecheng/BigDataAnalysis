A '''partsong''' is a piece of music to be sung by two or more voices without [[accompaniment (music)|accompaniment]].  Many partsongs are written for four voices: normally [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[bass (vocal range)|bass]].  Such a partsong can be performed just by four people, but it can also be performed by a larger group (a [[choir]]) which has divided into these four parts. 
 
 The term  " partsong "  can refer to music such as a [[glee]], [[madrigal]] or unaccompanied [[anthem]], but it is usually used in English when talking about short, secular (non-religious) songs without accompaniment.  In other [[language]]s there is no word which means quite the same thing. 
 
 Partsongs were very popular in the [[17th century]] in England.  They were often fun pieces to be sung at parties or in [[pub]]s.  They were often [[round (music)|rounds]], [[catch (music)|catches]] or [[quodlibet]]s.  In the [[19th century]] the madrigal came into fashion again and so many composers started writing partsongs.  Composers such as [[Sterndale Bennett]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Parry]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Edward Elgar]] wrote many partsongs, and later [[Finzi]], [[John Ireland]] and [[Moeran]]. 
 
 In Europe many [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]] composers wrote songs which could be described as partsongs: [[Schubert]], [[Schumann]], [[Mendelssohn]], [[Saint-SaÃ«ns]], [[Debussy]] and [[Ravel]].
