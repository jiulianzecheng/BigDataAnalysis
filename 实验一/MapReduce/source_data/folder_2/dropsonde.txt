 A '''dropsonde''' is a [[weather]] reconnaissance device created by the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR), designed to be dropped from an [[aircraft]] at altitude to more accurately measure (and therefore track) [[tropical storm]] conditions as the device falls to the ground. The dropsonde contains a [[GPS]] receiver, along with [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[humidity]] (PTH) [[sensor]]s to capture [[atmospheric]] profiles and [[thermodynamic]] [[Information|data]]. It typically relays these data to a computer in the aircraft by radio transmission. The device's descent is usually slowed by a [[parachute]], allowing for more readings to be taken before it reaches the [[water]] beneath.
