 The '''guanaco''' (''Lama guanicoe'') is [[camelid]] animal native to [[South America]]. Guanacos are usually found in small herds or loosely structured family groups. 
 
 == Description == 
 When a member of the herd picks up the slightest hint of danger, it makes a high-pitched warning call, causing the other guanacos to flee swiftly and nimbly across the steep and uneven terrain. 
 
 == Diet == 
 Guanacos generally live at high elevations, grazing on [[Grass|grasses]] and browsing on [[Leaf|leaves]] and buds. 
 They can get by without water for long periods of time, obtaining moisture from the [[plant]]s they eat.
