 The '''amplitude''' or '''peak amplitude''' of a [[wave]] is a measure of how big its [[oscillation]] is. 
 
 Amplitudes are always measured as [[positive numbers]] (for example: 3.5, 1, 120) and are never [[negative number|negative]] (for example: -3.5, -1, -120). That's because distance can only be greater than zero or equal to zero; negative distance does not exist. 
 
 The distance from the top of one peak to the bottom of another is called ''peak-to-peak amplitude''. Another way to describe peak-to-peak amplitude is to say that it is the distance between the maximum positive value and the maximum negative value of a wave is the maximum displacement of a wave from an equilibrium position
