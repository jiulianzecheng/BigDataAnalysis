 A '''strawberry''' is a short [[plant]] in the [[wild strawberry]] [[genus]] of the [[rosaceae|rose family]]. It is a widely grown [[hybrid]] species of the genus ''Fragaria''. The name is used for its very common [[sweet (taste)|sweet]] edible  " [[fruit]] "  and for [[flavor]]s that taste like it.  
 
 The real fruit of the plant are the tiny  " [[seed]]s "  around the  " fruit " . The fruit is actually a sweet [[swelling]] of the plant's [[stem]] around the real fruit, which people call the pips. 
 
 The plant grown today is a mix of two other [[species]] of [[wild strawberries]]. It was first grown in the 1750s. 
 
 ==Name== 
 The [[Latin]] name of the strawberry [[scientific name|used in science]] is ''{{lang|la|Fragaria}}''{{nbsp}}× ''{{lang|la|ananassa}}''. ''{{lang|la|[[Fragaria]]}}'' is the name of the [[genus]] of  " [[strawberry]]-like "  [[plant]]s. The [[:wikt:en:×|×]] mark means that it is a [[hybrid]], a mix of two other [[species]]. The [[Latin]] name ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:en:ananassus|ananassa]]}}'' says the hybrid is  " [[pineapple]]-like " . The strawberry is sometimes called the  " '''garden{{nbsp}}strawberry''' "  so that people don't mix it up with the other [[wild strawberries]] of the [[genus]] ''{{lang|la|[[Fragaria]]}}''. 
 
 The name is a bit misleading and is special to [[English language|English]]. The other [[Germanic languages]] do not have a name like it. No one is really sure where the name came from. < ref > {{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |contribution=strawberry, ''n.'' |date=1919 }}. < /ref >  The plant is not a kind of [[straw]], and its fruit is not really a [[berry]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 People have eaten different kinds of [[wild strawberries]] for thousands of years. Today's bigger strawberry was first made around [[Brest (France)|Brest]] in [[Brittany]] (northwest [[France]]) in the 1750s. It was made by joining the [[Virginia strawberry]] from eastern [[North America]] to the [[Europe]]an [[Hautbois]] and the [[Chilean strawberry]] from western [[South America]]. < ref > {{citation |last=Welsh |first=Martin |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802231801/http://www.nvsuk.org.uk/growing_show_vegetables_1/strawberry.php |contribution=Strawberries |url=http://www.nvsuk.org.uk |title=''Official website'' |publisher=National Vegetable Society |location=Aylesford |date=2006 }}. < /ref > 
 
 ==Farming== 
 Most strawberries are grown on [[farm]]s. Strawberry [[farmer]]s often have [[bee]]s in hives. The [[bee]]s pollinate the strawberries. 
 
 Strawberry stems are called runners. They grow above ground. They are a type of [[stolon]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Stem Modifications|url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/plant-form-and-physiology-30/stems-179/stem-modifications-688-11912/|work=Boundless Biology.|accessdate=22 February 2016|archive-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018110111/https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/plant-form-and-physiology-30/stems-179/stem-modifications-688-11912/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
