 A '''quarterback''' ('''QB''') is a position in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]]. Quarterbacks are members of the offense, or attacking [[team]]. They line up directly behind the center, in the middle of the offensive team's line. A quarterback is usually the leader, and starts most plays. In addition, the quarterback gives commands to the other players before the start of a play. A quarterback will in most attacking plays throw the ball to a member of their team, ready to run to the end of the pitch. Quarterbacks may also run the ball themselves, as well as hand the ball to a [[runningback]]. These players are usually the faces of their respective teams. Some very notable players at this position in history are [[Tom Brady]], [[Jim Kelly]], and [[Peyton Manning]].

 If quarterbacks don't like the formation the defense is using, they may use an audible. An audible is a way for the quarterback to change the play at the [[line of scrimmage]] (where players line up to start a play). He changes what the play will be by shouting out things that his teammates will understand. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.firstbasesports.com/football_glossary.html|title=Football Glossary|website=First Base Sports}} < /ref >  An audible may be called if the quarterback sees how the defensive players are lined up < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.footballbabble.com/football/terms/audible/|title=Audible - Football Terms - Hot Route - Hot Read - Quarterback Audibles|publisher=|access-date=2019-02-11|archive-date=2020-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918095026/https://www.footballbabble.com/football/terms/audible/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and does not think that the play that has been called would be good against how the defense is lined up.
