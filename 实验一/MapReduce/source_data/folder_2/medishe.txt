 '''Medishe''' is a heritage site just north of Jidali in Sanaag, Somalia. It was one of the first places bombed in African history, during raids against the [[Sayyidka]]. Sayyidka led a Dhulbahante state called [[Darawiish]], a successor state to the Dhulbahante garadship. Medishe is a place settled by the Ugaadhyahan subtribe of Dhulbahante. < ref > Strike From the Sky, Richard Hallion, 2010,  " 1920, six left to raid the Mullah's headquarters at Medishe " < /ref >
