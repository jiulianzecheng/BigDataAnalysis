 == History of the Louvre == 
 [[Philip II of France]] built a [[castle]] called the ''Castle of the Louvre''. It used to be where the museum is. They used the castle as a [[fortress]] to defend Paris against the [[Viking]]s. 
 [[Charles V of France|Charles V, King of France]] turned the castle into a [[palace]]. However, [[Francis I of France|Francis I, King of France]], [[wikt:demolish|knocked it down]] and built a new palace. 
 
 [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV, King of France]] added the [[Grande Galerie]] to the Louvre. The Grande Galerie is more than a quarter of a mile long and one hundred feet wide. The Grande Galerie was built along the [[River Seine]]. It was the longest building in the world. 
 
 The building was renovated during [[François Mitterrand|François Mitterand's]] time as [[President of the French Republic|French President]]. The glass pyramid and the inverted pyramid (made famous by ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', a novel and later a movie) were the work of architect [[I. M. Pei|I.M. Pei.]]
