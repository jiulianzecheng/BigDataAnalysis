 A '''doctorate''' is a higher degree earned by passing a doctoral dissertation at a university. Usually, it refers to a [[Ph.D.|Doctor of Philosophy]], but it can also be an [[Doctor of Medicine]] or an [[Juris Doctor]]. There are different levels of doctorate including professional doctorate such as [[Doctor of Pharmacy]], Juris Doctor (professional degree in law) and higher doctorates that require unique, independent research such as Doctor of Laws, Ph.Ds and Doctor of Science. Colleges often give honorary doctorates to famous people who [[speak]] there.
