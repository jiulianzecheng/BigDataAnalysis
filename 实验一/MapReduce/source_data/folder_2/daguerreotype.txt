 A '''Daguerreotype''' is a method of creating photographs that is no longer in general use. A man called [[Louis Daguerre|Louis-Jacques-Mand√© Daguerre]] invented the daguerreotype process in [[France]] in 1839.  
 
 The new type of photography became very popular very quickly as it was capable of capturing a  " truthful likeness. "  By 1850, there were over seventy daguerreotype studios in [[New York]] alone. 
 
 However the popularity of the daguerreotype was short lived as other cheaper processes were invented. By the late 1850s faster and less expensive processes such as the ambrotype, became available. A drawback of the Daguerreotype was that there was no negative from which to produce lots of images. Each picture was therefore unique, the only way to get a copy was to rephotograph the image.
