 '''Aphrodite''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀφροδίτη, ''Aphrodítē'') is the Ancient Greek [[goddess]] of [[love]], [[beauty]]. She was also the goddess of procreation. Aphrodite is one of the [[Twelve Olympians]]. The most beautiful and refined of the goddesses, Aphrodite was married to [[Hephaestus]], god of fire and metalworking. Aphrodite had numerous affairs with other beings, the most notable of these being [[Ares]], the god of war. 
 
 In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', one of the [[Okeanid|Oceanids]]. 
 In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', however, Aphrodite is stated to have risen from [[foam|sea foam]], formed at the spot where [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranos]]' genitals landed, after [[Kronos]] castrated him and tossed them into the sea. Aphrodite's cult was centered on the islands of [[Cythera]] and [[Cyprus]], both of which were claimed to be her birthplace. Her main festival was the Aphrodisia, which was celebrated annually every midsummer. The [[Charites]] (minor goddesses of grace and splendor) attended to Aphrodite and served as her handmaidens. Aphrodite's symbols include the [[dolphin]], [[myrtle]], [[rose]], [[dove]], [[sparrow]], [[swan]] and [[pearl]], and the dove, sparrow and swan were her sacred animals. The goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] is her Roman equivalent. Aphrodite was quite often described as very beautiful, and was used as a point of comparison for female beauty - but just as she was beautiful, she just as smart and wise.

 == Marriage == 
 Aphrodite was very beautiful, which made Zeus afraid that she would be the cause of fights between the other gods. He therefore gave Aphrodite to [[Hephaestus]]. Hephaestus was happy to be married to Aphrodite and gave her many pieces of [[jewelry]] which were gifts of love, like a belt that when ever she wore it, it would make men be attracted to her. Aphrodite, however, was not attracted to him. So she spent most of her time with [[Ares]], but she also spent time with [[Adonis]] and [[Anchises]]. She had many children.
