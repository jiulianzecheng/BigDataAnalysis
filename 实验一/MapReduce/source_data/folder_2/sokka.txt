 ==Concept and creation== 
 
 [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]] said that Sokka was originally designed to be ''much'' more low-key, but when his comedian voice actor [[Jack DeSena]] came in and brought liveliness to his character, they began writing towards that strength. < ref > [http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan09.jpg  " In Their Elements. "  (September 2006) ''Nick Mag Presents'', p. 7] < /ref >  Much of Sokka's dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSena's part that the writers chose to include within scripts. 
 
 As a result of his design, Sokka's character has come to serve as a source of [[comics|comic relief]] during the series, often a victim of visual [[slapstick]]. He also is extremely sarcastic. < ref name= " The Guru " > {{cite episode | title = The Guru |  series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-12-01 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 19}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 
 Sokka grew up in his [[village]] and trains the warriors of his village. Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid, he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal, while his sister [[Katara]] did chores and practiced [[water]]bending. < ref name= " The Boy In The Iceberg " > {{cite episode | title = The Boy In The Iceberg |  series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 1}} < /ref >  When Sokka was thirteen, his father and the other village men left to help the [[Earth|Earth Kingdom]] to fight against the Fire Nation, leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother, Gran Gran. < ref name= " Bato of the Water Tribe " > {{cite episode | title = Bato of the Water Tribe | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-10-07 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 15}} < /ref >  As the oldest male left in the South Pole, Sokka came to assume a semi-leadership role by the time he was sixteen, fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders. 
 
 While on an expedition, Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with [[Appa]]. After Katara freed him, Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy, and he eventually grew [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] enough to banish him from the village. Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar, destined to master all four [[classical element|element]]s and bring peace to the world, Sokka relented, realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation. He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the [[North Pole]], determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way. Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui (the moon spirit) causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse, thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending. Princess Yue (one of Sokka's love interests, the other being Kyoshi warrior Suki) then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit, thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders. < ref name= " The Avatar Returns " / > 
 
 In  " Sokka's Master "  (the 4th episode of [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 3)|third season]]) Sokka expresses self-doubt that he is not as useful to the group as his companions. Inspired by his friends' encouragement, he seeks out a master to learn the sword. Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique, Sokka's creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique, and his master claims that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman. As he departs, his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White [[Lotus]]. 
 
 In the two-hour [[Sozin's Comet: The Final Battle|series finale]], Sokka and Katara meet with Katara's Waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their grandmother. In the battle against Ozai, Sokka, his girlfriend Suki, and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King ([[Ozai]]). Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship, but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph, who was falling off the ship. In a compromised position, the pair are attacked by two soldiers, whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang. As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship, Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, with the rest of the group reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team, wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more  " memorable " . 
 
 ==Other media== 
 
 In the live-action movie [[The Last Airbender]] by [[M. Night Shyamalan]], Sokka is played by [[Jackson Rathbone]]. His name is pronounced  " So-kah, "  but in the show it's name pronounced  " Sah-kah " . Several important changes to the character's personality were made. In the film he is no longer the comic relief, nor does he exhibit any inventive abilities or usefulness in battle. He rarely shares screen time with Aang, the main [[hero]], or contributes in any way to the plot. M. Night Shyamalan has said in an interview that these decisions were made in order to  " ground "  the character. 
 
 He will be played by [[Ian Ousley]] in the [[Netflix]] [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (upcoming TV series) |live action remake]] of the series.
