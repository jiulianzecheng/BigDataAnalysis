 '''Gaul''' ({{lang-la|Gallia}}) was the name given in ancient times to the area of [[Western Europe]] that included northern [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], western [[Switzerland]] and the parts of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] on the west bank of the [[Rhine]] river. Many [[Celt]]ic tribes lived in the region and were known by the Romans simply as  " Gauls " .  
 
 In English, the word ''Gaul'' ({{lang-fr|Gaulois}}) may mean a [[Celt]]ic [[inhabitant]] of that region or it may mean all ancient speakers of the [[Gaulish language]].  In this way,  " Gaul "  and  " Celt "  are sometimes used in the same sense. 
 
 Gauls under [[Brennus (4th century)|Brennus]] [[attack]]ed Rome with the [[Battle of the Allia]] (390 BC).
