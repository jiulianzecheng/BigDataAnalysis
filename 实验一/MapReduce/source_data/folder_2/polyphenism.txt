 '''Polyphenism''' is a kind of [[polymorphism]] where different forms of an animal are caused a single [[genotype]]. The animal inherits the capability, but the environment determines which form develops. This contrasts with [[genetic polymorphism]], < ref > Ford E.B. 1975. ''Ecological genetics''. 4th ed, Chapman  &  Hall, London. < /ref >  where each morph (form) inherits a slightly different [[genome]]. 
 
 Polyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch. The switch is sensitive to some [[Nature versus nurture|environmental]] [[wikt:cue|cue]] or [[wikt:trigger|trigger]]. For example, the sex of [[crocodiles]] is determined by the prevailing temperature. Their gender is a polyphenic trait, and is not determined by the usual [[sex linkage]]. < ref name= " Woodward " > Woodward D.E. and Murray J.D. 199). On the effect of temperature-dependent sex determination on sex ratio and survivorship in crocodilians. ''Proc. R. Soc. Lond.'' [B] '''252''':149-155. < /ref >

 === The caste system in insects === 
 The [[Caste (biology)|caste system]] of [[eusociality|social]] insects is the division of labor between genetically identical individuals. Polyphenism determines whether larvae develop into queens, workers, and in some cases soldiers. In the case of the [[ant]], ''P. morrisi'', an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen. < ref > {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1071468 | last1 = Abouheif | first1 = E. | last2 = Wray | first2 = G.A. | year = 2002 | title = Evolution of the gene network underlying wing polyphenism in ants | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5579| pages = 249–252 | pmid = 12114626 | bibcode = 2002Sci...297..249A | s2cid = 33494473 }} < /ref >  This allows for control of the mating season, but like sex determination, limits the spread of the species into certain [[climate]]s. 
 In bees,  " royal jelly "  provided by worker bees causes a larva to become a queen. Royal jelly is only produced when the queen is aging or has died. 
 
 === Seasonal changes === 
 Polyphenic [[pigment|pigmentation]] is [[adaptive]] for species which reproduce several times a year. Different pigment patterns provide [[camouflage]] throughout the seasons, and alter heat retention as temperatures change. < ref name= " Braendle2006 " > {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bies.20456 | last1 = Braendle | first1 = C. | last2 = Flatt | first2 = T. | year = 2006 | title = A role for genetic accommodation in evolution? | url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/324319/files/2006_rga.pdf| journal = BioEssays | volume = 28 | issue = 9| pages = 868–873 | pmid = 16937342 }} < /ref >  Because insects cease growth and development after they are adults, their pigment pattern is set in adulthood. In the case of the [[peppered moth]], ''Biston betularia'', the caterpillars are [[polyphenic]]. Their trigger is switched by the colour of the plants they are eating: see [[peppered moth evolution#Camouflage of caterpillars|''this'']]. < ref name=Noor > {{cite journal |author=Noor MA, Parnell RS, Grant BS |title=A reversible color polyphenism in American Peppered Moth (Biston betularia cognataria) caterpillars |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e3142 |year=2008 |pmid=18769543 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003142 |pmc=2518955 |bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.3142N |editor1-last=Humphries |editor1-first=Stuart|doi-access=free }} < /ref >
