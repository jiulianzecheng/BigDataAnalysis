In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], '''caliph''' means  " a successor to the prophet " . This is what [[leader]]s of the [[Islam]]ic faith came to be called. Their rule is called a [[caliphate]].

 Some of the early leaders of the [[Muslim]] community following [[Muhammad]]'s (570–632) death called themselves '' " Khalifat Allah " '', meaning ''representative of God''. But the other title of '' " Khalifat rasul Allah " '', meaning the successor to the [[prophet]] of God, became the common title. Some academics write the term as ''Khalīf''. 
 
 Caliphs were often also called ''Amīr al-Mu'minīn'' ({{lang|ar|أمير المؤمنين}}), ''leader of the Muslims''. This title has since been shortened to  " emir " . It is also found as a [[personal name]] in some countries. 
 
 After the first four caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]], and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]), the title was used by the [[Umayyads]], the [[Abbasids]], and the [[Ottomans]], as well as by other [[dynasty|dynasties]] in [[Sindh|Southern Pakistan]], [[Al-Andalus|Spain]], [[Northern Africa]], and [[Egypt]]. Most historical Muslim [[ruler]]s simply titled themselves [[sultan]]s or [[emir]]s, and the caliph himself often had very little real authority. The title was not used after the Republic of [[Turkey]] abolished the [[Ottoman]] caliphate in [[1924]].
