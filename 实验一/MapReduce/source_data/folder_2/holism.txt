'''Holism'''  < ref > from {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'', a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning ''all'', ''whole'', ''entire'', ''total'' < /ref >  is the idea that natural [[system]]s ([[physical]], [[biological]], [[chemical]], [[social]], [[economic]], [[mental]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], etc.) and their properties, should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts. This often includes the view that systems somehow function as wholes and that their functioning cannot be fully understood solely in terms of their component parts. < ref > Oshry, Barry 2008.

 [[Reductionism]] is often viewed as the opposite of holism. Reductionism in [[science]] says that a complex system can be explained by ''reduction'' to its fundamental parts. For example, the processes of biology are reducible to chemistry and the laws of chemistry are explained by physics. 
 
 Social scientist and [[physician]] Nicholas A. Christakis explains that  " for the last few centuries, the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] project in science has been to break matter down into ever smaller bits, in the pursuit of understanding. And this works, to some extent...but putting things back together in order to understand them is harder, and typically comes later in the development of a scientist or in the development of science " . < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html |title=Christakis, Nicholas A.  2011.
