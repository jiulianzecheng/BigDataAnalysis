There are different ranks of demons and the Charmed ones have faced them all. In some situation demons actually helped the Charmed ones. Demons try to kill the Charmed ones to impress the Source and all of the Underworld.

 The Book of Shadows is the Charmed One's magical book. It contains spells, potions and information of various magical creatures such as [[demon]]s and warlocks.
