 '''Phengodidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of glow-worm [[beetle]]s. Their [[larvae]] are also [[glow-worm]]s. 
 
 The family occurs only in the [[New World]], and has about 30 [[genera]]. Both the [[female]]s and [[larva]]e are [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]]: they have organs that can produce [[light]]. This family is different from the [[Firefly|fireflies]] (family Lampyridae). 
 
 The larvae and the females (which keep their larval form) are [[predator]]s. They feed on [[millipede]]s and other animals they find in the [[soil]] and [[litter]]. Males are winged. They are attracted to lights at night. They are probably short-lived and do not feed at all. In some species, adult males can also produce light. Females have organs that produce a green or yellow light on their [[Torso|trunks]].  Some of them (called [[railroad worm]]s) also have such an organ in front, which can produce a red light.
