 '''Leuk''' (French '''Loèche''') is a municipality of Switzerland and is the capital city of the district of [[Leuk (district)|Leuk]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Valais]] in [[Switzerland]].

 Loèche houses the installations of [[Onyx (interception system)|Onyx]], the Swiss interception system for electronic intelligence gathering.
