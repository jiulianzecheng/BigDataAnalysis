 == Etymology == 
 The word Arabic word Shahadat ({{Lang-ar|شهدات|lit=}}) literally means 'martyrdom'. It is derived from Shaheed ({{Lang-ar|شهيد‎|lit=}}) which denotes a martyr in Islam. < ref > {{cite news|last1=Khalid Zaheer|date=November 22, 2013|title=Definition of a shaheed|agency=Dawn|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1057801|access-date=11 January 2016}} < /ref >  The word ''Shaheed'' occurs frequently in the Quran in the generic sense 'witness', but only once in the sense 'martyr'; this latter sense acquires wider use in the hadiths. < ref > {{cite web|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, μάρτυ^ς|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=ma/rtus|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}} < /ref >  In Arabic, Shaheed can mean both a 'witness' and a 'martyr'. < ref > " The word shahid (plural shahada) has the meaning of  " martyr "  and is closely related in its development to the Greek martyrios in that it means both a witness and a martyr [...] in the latter sense only once is it attested (3:141).
