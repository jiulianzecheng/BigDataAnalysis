[[File:Dundas-square-splash-fountains1024.jpg|thumb|Most bathing is done in hot water or hot [[steam bath|steam]]. However, splash baths function like a cold shower to help people cool off on hot days. A jogger is shown, in this [[multiple exposure]] picture, running through the [[Dundas Square]] [[splash pad]] to cool down.]]

 '''Bathing''' is putting the [[body]] into a fluid, most often [[water]], or a solution with water. Usually it is done for [[hygiene]] or for [[religion|religious]] purposes, or for [[fun]]. Sometimes bathing is also done as a form of [[therapy]]. 
 
 When people talk about bathing, they most often mean being immersed in water. But people have also  " bathed "  in other substances. Some therapies involve bathing in [[mud]]. People have also bathed in other substances, like [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]], [[bean]]s, or [[chocolate]]. A form of bathing quite common is bathing in [[sunlight]].

 Bathing serves several purposes: 
 * [[Hygiene]], and the physical appearance of cleanliness 
 * [[Decontamination]] from [[chemical hazard|chemical]], [[Biological hazard|biological]], [[nuclear hazard|nuclear]] or other exposure-type hazards. 
 * [[Recreation]] 
 * Therapy (e.g. [[hydrotherapy]]), healing, rehabilitation from injury or addiction, relaxation (e.g. [[Blessed Rainy Day]]) 
 * [[Religion|Religious]], or, less frequently, other ceremonial [[rite]]s (e.g. [[Baptism]], [[Mikvah]]) 
 * Celebration and socialization, e.g. running through fountains after winning the [[World Series]], or jumping through a hole cut in the ice over a lake on [[New Year's Eve]]. 
 * Ensuring people are free of certain items such as weapons or other [[contraband]]: In Chicago, Russian baths were a safe meeting place for rival gang leaders. Weapons are difficult to conceal on a nearly naked body. If the meeting resulted in reconciliation, the gangs would meet upstairs for [[bagel]]s, [[cream cheese]] and [[borscht]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/russianbaniaspreading.htm |title=The Russian Bania:The Spreading Influence of the Russian Steam Bath < !-- Bot generated title -- >  |access-date=2008-11-20 |archive-date=2004-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022081945/http://www.cyberbohemia.com/Pages/russianbaniaspreading.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Many homeless shelters, and almost all prisons have an [[intake facility]] or intake process that includes a supervised [[shower]] with change of clothes to ensure that no contraband or contamination enters the facility.
