A '''phasor''' is a [[tool]] in [[mathematics]]. It is used to show [[number]]s in a different [[coordinate system]].  Certain electronic components have models that can be described more easily by the use of phasors.  [[Inductor|Inductors]] add a +90ยบ  " phase " , while [[Capacitor|capacitors]] add -90ยบ  " phase " . Both elements work on the imaginary axis.  [[Resistor|Resistors]] have 0ยบ  " phase " , and are considered real.
