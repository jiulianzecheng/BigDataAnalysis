 A '''liqueur''' is a [[:wikt:sweet|sweet]]-tasting [[alcohol]]ic drink. It is often flavored with [[fruit]]s, [[herb]]s, [[spice]]s, [[flower]]s, [[seed]]s, [[root]]s, [[plant]]s, [[bark]]s, and sometimes [[cream]]. The word ''liqueur'' comes from the Latin word ''liquifacere'' which means  " [[:wikt:dissolve|to dissolve]]. "  This is because the flavors are dissolved to help make the liqueur. In some parts of the world, liqueurs are sometimes called '''cordials'''. 
 
 Liqueurs have been around for many centuries. They are related to the herbal medicines that [[monk]]s used to make. Liqueurs were made in [[Italy]] as early as the [[13th century]], and were used during signings of [[treaty|treaties]] during the [[Middle Ages]].
