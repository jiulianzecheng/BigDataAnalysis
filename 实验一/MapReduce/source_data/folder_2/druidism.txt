'''Druidism''' or '''Druidry''' (referred to as '''Neodruidry''' or '''Neodruidism''' by some followers) is a [[Celtic]] form of modern [[spirituality]] that generally promotes [[harmony]] with [[nature]], often through the form of nature [[worship]]. It is considered to be a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] faith. 
 
 Originally inspired by 17th, 18th and 19th century [[Romanticism|romantic]] movements, early neo-druidism was based upon largely historically incorrect depictions of the [[Iron Age]] [[Celt]]ic [[druid]]s, and has no direct relation to the ancient Celts or their culture. < ref > " Modern Druids have no direct connection to the Druids of the Iron Age. Many of our popular ideas about the Druids are based on the misunderstandings and misconceptions of scholars 200 years ago. These ideas have been superseded by later study and discoveries. "  Druids are also known to be very close with nature.[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/article_index/d/the_druids.aspx] < /ref >
