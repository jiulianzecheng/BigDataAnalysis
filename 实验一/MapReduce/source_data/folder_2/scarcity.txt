'''Scarcity''' in [[economics]] is the lack of various forms of [[capital (economics)|capital]]. Scarcity can be used to describe an economic [[wikt:situation|situation]] in economics, or it can be used to describe more general situations. 
 
 In economics, scarcity is the result of [[wikt:people|people]] having  " Unlimited Wants and Needs, "  or always wanting something new, and having  " Limited [[Resource]]s. "  Limited Resources means that there are never enough resources, or [[material]]s, to [[satisfaction|satisfy]], or fulfill, the wants and needs that every person have. Scarcity is called the  " basic economic problem, "  meaning that it always [[existence|exists]]. 
 
 Scarcity exists due to the effects of [[nature]] such as [[drought]], [[flood]]s, storms, pest infestation, [[fire]] and other things.  Real scarcity can also exist by over use of [[non-renewable resources]].  Goods (things) and [[service]]s are also scarce because there are only a [[Constraint|limited]] [[number]] of things in the [[world]] and due to the limits of [[technology]] and our own [[priority|priorities]]. 
 
 More scarce goods and services have higher prices, because of [[supply and demand]]. [[Gold]] is used less than [[iron]], but the price of gold is much higher, because gold is more scarce. [[Lawyers]] are paid more than [[Janitor|janitors]], because there is scarcity of qualified lawyers. 
 
 Scarcity of capital is the main constraint in [[economic development]] of [[Developing country|developing countries]]. Economic growth is an increase in the production and consumption of goods and services. It entails increasing population or per capita consumption.

 Artificial scarcity is when somebody limits the amount of goods or services that are available, although it would be simple to make more. Artificial scarcity can increase profits for a business. Some people will pay more for something that is scarce, because it shows that they are rich (a status symbol).
