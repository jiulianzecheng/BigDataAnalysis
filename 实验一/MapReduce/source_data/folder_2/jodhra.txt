 The Jodhra tribe converted to [[Islam]] in the hand of Mahmud of Ghazni, they came to Attock in the end 16th Century and got their hands on  much of the land of north Punjab mainly the 'illaquas' of Sohan, Sill, Talagang and Chakwal. The Jodhra were [[independent]] Chiefs keeping up a large body of armed retainers. They saw their peak in the times of Malik Aulia Khan after which owing to family feuds and other causes the tribe has lost much of its original prosperity. 
 Their fights with Gheba tribe were an essential part of their history and were known as 'arch-rivals' and enemies but now the two tribes inter-marry and are on friendly terms.In Sir Lepel Griffins book it is stated that the Jodhra are men of principles who could kill for their prestige, they are strong, proud of their culture and traditions.
