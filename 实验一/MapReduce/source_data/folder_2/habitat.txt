 A '''habitat''' is the area in which an organism lives. It is a summary term for all the resources, [[physical]] and living which are present in an area. < ref > {{cite web|publisher=Merriam-Webster|title=Habitat |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habitat|accessdate=15 June 2012}} < /ref > < ref name= " Abercrombie 66 " > {{cite book |last1=Abercrombie |first1=M. |last2=Hickman |first2=C.J. |last3=Johnson |first3=M.L |year=1966 |title=A dictionary of biology |publisher=Penguin |location=London}} < /ref >  It is the [[natural environment]] in which an organism lives, and the physical environment which surrounds a [[population]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Living things: habitats and ecosystems|url=http://www.fi.edu/tfi/units/life/habitat/habitat.html|publisher=The Franklin Institute|accessdate=29 June 2011|archive-date=8 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408001945/http://www.fi.edu/tfi/units/life/habitat/habitat.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Animal habitats == 
 Most animals live in one type of [[environment]] because they are best suited to it. We say they are '[[adaptation|adapted]] to this environment'. For example, animals such as [[frog]]s, [[newt]]s, and [[duck]]s have webbed feet to help them swim in the water. There are many different types of habitats and many kinds of adaptations to each habitat. 
 
 If the habitat changes, it may no longer be suitable for the animals and [[plant]] < nowiki/ > s that live there. [[Climate change]] is making some habitats [[Global warming|warmer]], and so many animal species are moving to cooler areas. < ref name= "  harvey " > {{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/18/climate-change-species-habitats |title=Climate change driving species out of habitats much faster than expected |first=Fiona |last=Harvey |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2011 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=18 November 2012}} < /ref >  However some species are not able to move and the populations are getting smaller. Scientists think that 10% of species may become [[extinct]] because of these changes. < ref name= "  harvey " / >  Other habitats have been cleared to make them into farm land. In Australia for example, 80% of the [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] forests have been cleared for farming over the last 210 years. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://www.savethekoala.com/our-work/land-clearing-koalas |title=Land Clearing  &  Koalas  |first= |last= |work=Australian Koala Foundation |year=2012 |accessdate=18 November 2012}} < /ref >  This is threatening the survival of forest animals such as the [[koala]]. 
 
 == Plant habitats == 
 Just as animals adapt to the places they live, so do plants. Plants are adapted to a wide variety of habitats. As a result, each plant has certain characteristics. Some are adapted to living on land while others live in water. Plants that grow on land usually have stiff stems to hold them upright, while water plants tend to have less rigid stems because the water supports them. 
 
 Plants that live in dry climates like the [[desert]] have few or no leaves.  Many, such as [[cacti]], store water when rain occurs.  Their adaptations save water.  Plants that grow in shaded areas have large leaves to capture as much sunlight as possible, or they climb towards the light.
