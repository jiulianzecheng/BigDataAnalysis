 An '''election''' is a way people can choose their [[candidate]] or their preferences in a [[representative democracy]] or other form of government. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What is Election Campaign {{!}} IGI Global|url=https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/electoral-umpires-and-the-task-of-tracking-political-campaign-funds/77957|access-date=2021-10-24|website=www.igi-global.com}} < /ref >   
 
 Most [[democracy|democratic]] countries hold new elections for their national [[legislature]] every few years. What elections do is select representatives for the local areas. These are called MPs (Members of Parliament) in the British [[parliamentary system]]. Parliamentary systems may have a head of government and a head of state, but sometimes the two posts are held by the same person. 
 
 The legislature chooses the government, usually by majority vote in the legislature. Some democracies elect a [[president]], who then selects the government. Many democratic countries also have regional, provincial or state elections. 
 
 There are different ways to organize an election in different countries. Voters might vote for an individual, or they might vote for a political [[Political party|party]] ([[party list]]). This is because different countries use different [[voting systems]].  
 
 As a foundation of [[democracy]], voting in elections has been adopted in most countries around the world. Whilst the process of electing an individual as a representative in a government can be simple, many election candidates spend mass amounts of money on their campaigns. The past decade has seen a consistent trend of politicians and election candidate spending more and more on their campaigns. Higher household incomes, [[inflation]] and population growth are all factors that have contributed to this trend of higher election spend. < ref > {{Cite web|date=24 April 2019|title=Impact of Election Costs|url=https://extras.com.au/election-costs-around-the-world/|access-date=2021-10-24|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Every country around the world has different rules and regulations when it come sot voting in elections. The biggest differences amongst most major countries is, the age in which an individual may vote and whether voting in an election is compulsory or not. [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Austria]] are among the few countries where the legal voting age is 16.  
 
 Countries that are not democracies can also hold elections. This is usually done to let the people choose a local representative (like a [[mayor]]). Also many countries call themselves democracies, but behind the scenes have a more autocratic form of [[government]]. 
 
 [[Vatican City]] is a [[theocracy]]: The [[pope]] (and a few high-ranking [[Clergy|clerics]]) run the [[state]]. When the pope dies, or steps down, a number of high-ranking priests (called cardinals) select a new pope, through an election. When they are done, they will announce the result in a speech, called [[Habemus Papam]] (Latin: We have a pope) 
 
 Elections keep a [[democratic]] country functioning, as they give people the right to select their own government. However, there are ways a government can  " fix "  elections. Opposition candidates are permitted in former [[USSR]] countries, but they are usually prevented from using broadcasting or the newspapers. This means that, in effect, the ruling president is never challenged. Elections which are fixed are sometimes called sham elections or show elections. < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-wins-100-of-the-vote-in-north-korean-elections-9180814.html | title=Kim Jong-un wins 100% of the vote in his constituency| website=[[Independent.co.uk]]| date=10 March 2014}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/21/world/meast/yemen-elections/index.html|title=Yemen holds presidential election with one candidate|first=Mohammed |last=Jamjoom|website=CNN|date=21 February 2012 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/29/egyptian-opposition-calls-boycott-elections-challengers-arrested/|title=Egyptian opposition calls for boycott of elections after challengers are arrested and attacked|first1=Raf|last1=Sanchez|first2=Magdy|last2=Samaan|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=29 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}} < /ref > < ref name= " urlAlexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election | The Independent " > {{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/alexei-navalny-latest-updates-russia-president-election-opposition-leader-putin-protests-a8222956.html |title=Alexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election  & #124; The Independent |website= [[Independent.co.uk]]|accessdate=|date=22 February 2018 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764407,00.html|title=RUSSIA: Justice in The Baltic|date=1940-08-19|magazine=Time|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}} < /ref > < ref name= " urlYes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Heres How They Work - The Atlantic " > {{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/north-korea-elections-guide/358875/ |title=Yes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Here's How They Work - The Atlantic |format= |website= [[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=|date=6 March 2014 }} < /ref > 
 
 Countries where the candidates are elected with a very high approval rating usually use elections to hide a more [[autocratic]] form of government. When [[Saddam Hussein]] was elected [[president of Iraq]] in 1995, he got 99.96% approval. There were about 8.4 million valid votes,  3,052 people voted against him. < ref name= " Yahia " > Yahia, Latif; Wendl, Karl. ''I Was Saddam's Son'', p.281-2. Arcade Publishing (1997), {{ISBN|1-55970-373-3}} < /ref > < ref name= " surprise " > " No Surprise in Iraqi Vote " , ''The New York Times'', October 17, 1995. Ibrahim declared:  " It is an immortal day in the history of Arabism and Islam. It is a blow to the states that have harbored enmity toward Iraq and raised unjustified doubts about the legitimacy of its regime or the right of its people to choose the form of government they like. " < /ref >    99.47% of all people allowed to vote did so (this is called voting turnout). < ref > Bueno de Mesquita, Bruce; Root, Hilton L. ''Governing for Prosperity'', p.62. Yale University Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-300-08018-2}} < /ref >   Another example: [[Kim Jong-un]] was elected the leader of [[North Korea]], in 2014, with 100% of the vote.
