[[File:Liquid_oxygen_in_a_magnet.jpg|thumb|right|When [[liquid oxygen]] is poured from a [[beaker]] into a strong [[magnet]], the oxygen temporarily stays between the [[magnetic poles]] owing to its paramagnetism]] 
 '''Paramagnetism''' is a form of [[magnetism]] whereby some [[material]]s are weakly attracted by an [[wikt:applied|applied]] [[magnetic field]] and form [[Magnetization|induced magnetic fields]] in the direction of the magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most [[chemical element]]s and some [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. They have a relative [[magnetic permeability]] that is a little bit higher than 1. The [[magnetic moment]] caused by the applied magnetic field is [[Linearity|linear]] in the [[field strength]] and weak. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52165864|title=Inorganic chemistry|last=Miessler, Gary L., 1949-|date=2004|publisher=Pearson Education|others=Tarr, Donald A.
