 '''Chromatophores''' are [[pigment]]-containing and [[light]]-reflecting [[cell (biology)|cells]] found in [[amphibian]]s, [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[cephalopod]]s. They are largely responsible for generating skin and eye color in [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] animals. 
 
 Some [[species]] can rapidly change color so as to keep in [[camouflage]], or to [[signal]]. They do this by moving pigment and reflective plates in chromatophores. This process is called physiological color change. Cephalopods such as [[octopus]] have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this. The display is under central nervous control based usually on input from the eyes. 
 
 [[Vertebrate]]s such as [[chameleon]]s get a similar effect by [[Signal transduction|cell signalling]]. Such signals can be [[hormone]]s or [[neurotransmitter]]s. They may be started by changes in [[mood]], temperature, [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] or visible changes around the animal.

 [[Coleoidea|Colleoid]] cephalopods have complex organs which they use to change color rapidly. This is seen in [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]] and octopuses. Each chromatophore unit is a single chromatophore cell and muscle, nerve, [[glial cell|glial]] and sheath cells. < ref name=cephalopod1 > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00347297 | last1 = Cloney | first1 = RA | last2 = Florey | first2 = E | title = Ultrastructure of cephalopod chromatophore organs | journal = Zeitschrift fur Zellforschung und mikroskopische Anatomie (Vienna, Austria : 1948) | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 250–80 | year = 1968 | pmid = 5700268  | s2cid = 26566732 }} < /ref >  Inside the chromatophore cell, pigment granules are in an elastic sac. To change color the animal changes the sac form or size by muscular contraction. This changes its appearance. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, because the shape of the sac is being changed rather than pigment being moved in the cell. However, a similar effect is achieved. 
 
 Octopuses can operate chromatophores in complex, wavelike displays, giving rapidly changing color schemes. The nerves that operate the chromatophores are thought to be positioned in the brain in a pattern similar to that of the chromatophores they each control. This may explain why, as the neurons are activated one after another, the color change occurs in waves. < ref name=octopus > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000113909 | last1 = Demski | first1 = LS | title = Chromatophore systems in teleosts and cephalopods: a levels oriented analysis of convergent systems | journal = Brain, Behavior and Evolution | volume = 40 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 141–56 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1422807 }} < /ref > 
 
 Like chameleons, cephalopods use color change for social interaction. They are also among the most skilled at [[camouflage]], with the ability to match both the color and the [[texture]] of their local environment with remarkable accuracy.
