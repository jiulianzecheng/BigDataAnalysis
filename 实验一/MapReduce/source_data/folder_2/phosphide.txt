'''Phosphide''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is sometimes P < sup > 3- < /sup > , but it does not always have that formula. It is a [[reducing agent]]. Phosphides ([[chemical compound]]s having the phosphide ion in them) react with [[acid]]s to make [[phosphine]] gas.  [[Sodium phosphide]] is an example. Some phosphides are [[semiconductor]]s and are not [[ionic bond|ionic]] with P < sup > 3- < /sup >  ions. They are less reactive. Some metals form [[alloy]]s with phosphorus to make phosphides. If it is ionic, then the phosphorus is in the -3 [[oxidation state]].
