 The reason why this meme happened is because ''Barbie'', a fantasy comedy movie based on the fashion doll [[Barbie]], and ''Oppenheimer'', a biographical thriller movie about theoretical physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], caused a comedic response because they were being released on the same date. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-embraces-barbenheimer-memes-mashups-more |title=The Internet Embraces 'Barbenheimer' With Memes, Mashups, and More |date=June 30, 2023 |last=Ankers-Range |first=Adele |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=July 2, 2023}} < /ref >  ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' described the two movies as extremely opposite to each other. < ref > {{Cite web |last=Clark |first=Nicole |date=2023-06-28 |title=The people refuse to decide between Barbie and Oppenheimer |url=https://www.polygon.com/23775980/barbie-oppenheimer-release-date-showdown-memes |access-date=2023-07-02 |website=Polygon |language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 The meme gained popularity with several movie theatres selling both movies as double features. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/barbie-oppenheimer-barbenheimer-premiere-e8007fe3 |title=World's Strangest Double Feature: 'Barbie,' Then 'Oppenheimer' |date=July 13, 2023 |last=Ampil |first=Izzy |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=July 14, 2023}} < /ref >  Actor [[Tom Cruise]], ''Barbie'' director [[Greta Gerwig]] and actress [[Margot Robbie]] took part of the  " Barbenheimer "  phenomenon and watched both movies. < ref > {{Cite web |last=Garbutt |first=Emily |date=June 30, 2023 |title=Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie have accepted Tom Cruise's movie marathon mission |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/greta-gerwig-margot-robbie-barbie-oppenheimer-double-bill/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230701165458/https://www.gamesradar.com/greta-gerwig-margot-robbie-barbie-oppenheimer-double-bill/ |archive-date=July 1, 2023 |access-date=July 2, 2023 |work=[[Total Film]]}} < /ref >  In an interview, ''Oppenheimer'' actor [[Cillian Murphy]] supported the phenomenon, saying  " My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day.

 Many critics were surprised by how  " Barbenheimer "  was helping the release of both movies being release on the same day, whereas normally when two major movies were being released on the same day, they would compete at the [[box office]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Burton|first=Carson|date=July 18, 2023|title=I've Never Seen Anything Like This': Why Barbenheimer Has Box Office Analysts Reeling|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-anything-like-this-why-barbenheimer-has-box-office-analysts-reeling|access-date=July 21, 2023|website=[[IGN]]}} < /ref >
