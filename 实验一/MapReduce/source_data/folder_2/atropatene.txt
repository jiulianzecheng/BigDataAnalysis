 '''Atropatene''' was an ancient [[kingdom]] that existed in part of what is now Iran. It existed with [[Darius III of Persia]] and [[Alexander the Great]]. It started in the 4th century BCE, in what is now northern Iran. Its capital was Ganzak. It ended as a [[Vassal state|vassal]] kingdom of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian empire]]. In 226, the [[Sasanian empire]] conquered it. At that time it was probably more of a province of the Parthian empire than a kingdom, even though its rulers were kings.  
 
 Today, many people see it as a predecessor of the modern state of [[Azerbaijan]].
