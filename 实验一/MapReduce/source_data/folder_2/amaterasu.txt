'''Amaterasu''' ({{lang-ja|天照}}), '''Amaterasu-ōmikami''' ({{lang-ja|天照大神}} or {{lang|ja|天照大御神}}) or '''Ōhirume-no-muchi-no-kami''' ({{lang-ja|大日孁貴神}}), is a goddess in [[Japanese mythology]]. She is the [[Sun]] [[Goddess]], and the most [[sacred]] of all [[kami|Shinto deities]]. Her name, ''Amaterasu'', means '' " (that which) illuminates [[Heaven]]. " '' Her [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] is at [[Ise]]. 
 
 ==Tradition==  
 Amaterasu is the sister of [[Susano'o]], the god of the [[sea]] and [[storms]], and of [[Tsukuyomi]], the god of the [[moon]]. All three were created from [[Izanagi]], when he washed his face to clean the [[dirt]]iness of [[Yomi]], the [[underworld]]. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye, and Susano'o from the washing of the nose. 
 
 == Story == 
 The tales tell of great [[wiktionary:rivalry|rivalry]] between Amaterasu and Susano'o. When he was to leave [[Heaven]] forever because Izanagi ordered him to, he went to say goodbye to his sister. Amaterasu, suspicious, proposed him a [[wikt:challenge|challenge]]: each of them was to turn an object of the other's into people. Amaterasu created three women from Susanoo's sword while he created five men from her [[necklace]]. Amaterasu said the men were hers because they were born of her necklace. Susano'o destroyed her [[rice]] fields, threw a dead [[pony]] into her [[loom]], and killed one of her assistants in [[anger]]. For this, Amaterasu, sad, angry and scared, went to hide inside [[Ama-no-Iwato]], the '' " heavenly rock [[cave]] " '', so the Sun was hidden and the world became dark for a long time. The [[Oni (folklore)|Oni]] ([[devil]]s of Japanese mythology) came out to the dark world, and the gods could not make Amaterasu come out of the cave. 
 
 The intelligent goddess of [[happiness]], [[Ama-no-Uzume]] (天宇受売命), took a big bucket, turned it upside down near the cave entrance, and began a dance on it, tearing off her clothing in front of the other Kami. They thought this was so funny that they laughed happily. 
 
 Amaterasu heard them, and looked out to see why the gods were laughing. When she opened the cave, she saw her wonderful reflection in a [[mirror]] Uzume had put on a tree, and slowly came out of the cave. 
 
 At that moment, the god Ameno-Tajikarao (天手力男命) closed the cave behind her, so she could not go back in. Another god tied a magic rope across the entrance. The sun goddess was then asked by the Kami [[Ame-no-Koyane]] (天児屋根命) to go back with the gods. She agreed, and light came back to the earth, but Susanoo was [[punishment|punished]] by being banished from Heaven.
