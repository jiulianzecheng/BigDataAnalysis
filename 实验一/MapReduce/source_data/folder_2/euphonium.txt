 The '''euphonium''' is a [[brass instrument]].  It is very similar to the [[baritone horn]], but it is different because the tubes are wider and it is bigger. The euphonium makes low sounds, similar to the [[trombone]]. The euphonium has 3 or 4 valves and 1-3 spit valves.  " Spit "  valves do not really mean there is [[saliva|spit]] in the instrument, it means that there is [[condensation]] in the instrument. 
 
 The euphonium is seen in different sorts of [[bands]] in Europe and America. The musicians make the sound by blowing into the instrument and  " buzzing "  with their lips.  
 
 The word euphonium means:  " producing nice sounds "   
 
 Euphoniums are basically [[silver]] and [[brass]] in colour.
