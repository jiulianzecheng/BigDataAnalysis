 '''Pythagoras of Samos''' was a famous [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] ({{nowrap|{{circa}} 570 –}} {{nowrap|c. 495 BC}}). < ref > " The dates of his life cannot be fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of Aristoxenus (ap. Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty " . Guthrie W.K.C. 1978. ''A history of Greek philosophy, volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans''. Cambridge University Press, page 173. < /ref > < ref name=J / >  He is known best for the [[proof]] of the important [[Pythagorean theorem]], which is about [[right angle triangle]]s. He started a group of mathematicians, called the Pythagoreans, who worshiped [[number]]s and lived like [[monk]]s. He had an influence on [[Plato]]. 
 
 He had a great impact on mathematics, [[theory of music]] and [[astronomy]]. His theories are still used in mathematics today. He was one of the greatest thinkers of his time. 
 
 Pythagoras was born in [[Samos]], a little [[island]] off the western coast of [[Asia Minor]]. There is not much information about his life. It is said that he had a good childhood. Growing up with two or three brothers, he was well educated. He did not agree with the government and their schooling, so he moved to Crotone and set up a community of followers. After joining the community his students stayed silent for 5 years, and they did not have any personal possessions. Pythagoras taught them all, and they had to obey strict rules. 
 
 Some say he was the first person to use the term [[philosophy]]. Since he worked very closely with his group, the Pythagoreans, it is sometimes hard to tell his works from those of his followers. 
 
 [[Religion]] was important to the [[Pythagoreans]]. They swore their oaths by  " 1+2+3+4 "  (which equals 10.0). They also believed the [[soul]] is immortal and goes through a cycle of [[rebirth]]s until it can become pure. They believed that these souls were in both [[animal]] and [[plant]] life. He also believed that any animals soul was the same except for humans because of their higher intelligence.

 Pythagoras' most important belief was that the physical world was mathematical and that numbers were the real reality. < ref name= " J " > {{Cite web |title=JOC/EFR 1999.

 Pythagoras is most famous for his [[theorem]] to  do with [[right triangle]]s. He said that the length of the longest side of the right angled triangle called the hypotenuse (C) squared would equal the sum of the other sides squared. And so a² + b² = c² was born. There are many different proofs for this [[Pythagorean theorem]].
