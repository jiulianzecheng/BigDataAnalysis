 '''Stegocephali'''  is a group containing all four-[[limb]]ed [[Vertebrate|vertebrates]]. 
 
 The word was first used  in 1868 by the American [[paleontologist]] [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who used it as a general category of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Amphibian|amphibians]]. This did not get used by other people.   
 
 In 1998 the  Canadian paleontologist Michel Laurin used the word  and gave a formal [[phylogenetic]] definition.  This was intended to include [[Taxon|taxa]] with digits rather than [[Fin|fins]], except where secondarily lost. < ref > Michel Laurin (1998): The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution.
