 '''''Casineria''''' was a [[tetrapod]] which lived 340 million years ago (mya) in the [[Mississippian]]. It was a small animal, length about 15 centimeters.  
 
 It lived in what was then a fairly dry [[environment]] in what is now [[Scotland]]. It had a [[mosaic evolution|mosaic]] of '[[basal]]' (= primitive) amphibian and '[[derived]]' (= advanced) [[amniote]] characters.  
 
 ''Casineria'' was at or very near the origin of the [[amniote]]s. It may have been one of the very first true amniotes. The only [[fossil]] lacks key elements: most of the [[skull]] and the whole lower body is missing. This makes exact analysis difficult. < ref > Monastersky R.

 ''Casineria'' was an [[insectivore]]. This earliest amniote had five fingers with [[claw]]s on each hand, and marks the earliest known clawed foot. < ref name=nature/ > < ref > Alibardi L. 2008.

 Its name, ''Casineria'', is a [[latin]] version of ''Cheese Bay'', the site near [[Edinburgh]], where it was found. 
 
 ==Discovery== 
 In 1992, an amateur fossil collector spotted the remains of this four-legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay, Scotland. < ref > {{Cite web|title=CHEESE BAY|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2916.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728225550/http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2916.pdf|archive-date=2008-07-28|access-date=2011-09-27}} < /ref >  For the next five years, the fossil waited at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]] while researchers focused on other projects. In 1997, work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix of stone.  
 
 The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an [[environment]] much drier than previously understood. The findings were first reported in 1999. < ref name=nature > Paton R.L., Smithson T.R. and Clack J.A. 1999.

 ==Phylogenetic relationship== 
 ''Casineria'' shows features that ties it in with early tetrapods, notably a generally gracile (slim) build with light leg-bones, unfused ankles and toes ending in claws. This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction, rather than as holdfasts. This indicates a mainly terrestrial lifestyle. < ref name=nature/ >  These traits shows it was closely related to [[amniote]]s. 
 
 With its advanced features, ''Casineria'' may have been one of the very first true amniotes, that is, egg-layers before the split between [[Synapsid]]s and [[Sauropsid]]s. ''Casineria'' pushes back the origin of amniote lineages much further than was previously realized. < ref name=nature/ > 
 
 ''Casineria'' and its relatives were perhaps the first vertebrates to live and [[Reproduction|reproduce]] on land.
