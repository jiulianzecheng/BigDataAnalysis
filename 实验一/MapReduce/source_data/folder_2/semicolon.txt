 A '''semicolon''' is a [[punctuation]] mark. It looks like this: ''';''' 
 
 ==Use in English== 
 In the standard English language, a semicolon has only two uses.  First, to connect two [[independent clause]]s into a single sentence.  For example: 
 " I could tell that it was getting late; it was growing darker by the second. " 
 The second use of a semicolon is to separate items in a series when the items contain parenthetical elements within themselves.  For example: 
 " The following crewmembers were on the bridge: James T. Kirk, captain of the 
 Enterprise; Mr. Spock, first science officer; Mr. Sulu, helmsman; Mr. Scott, 
 engineer; and Dr. McCoy, chief medical officer. " 
 
 A semicolon is also used with a conjunctive adverb when joining two clauses.  In reality, this is the same as the first rule, but it looks different enough to sometimes cause concern. 
 
 For example: 
 " huzaifa, context in which all life exists; consequently, it is more than a political issue. " 
 
 ==Use in Computer Programming== 
 A semicolon is sometimes used in programming. In programming languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], semicolons are used to separate logical statements. 
 
 < syntaxhighlight lang= " C " > 
 int main() { 
   int x, y; 
   x = 1; y = 2; 
   printf( " X + Y = %d " , x + y); 
   return 0; 
 }
