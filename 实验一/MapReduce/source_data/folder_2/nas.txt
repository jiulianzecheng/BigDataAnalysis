 ==Career== 
 ===1990s=== 
 Nas started making music when he was a teenager. He recorded his first music with a [[Record producer|producer]] called [[Large Professor]], but did not yet publish it. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.stopthebreaks.com/gems/nas-first-recording-session-large-professor/|title=Hip-Hop Gem: Nas' First Recording Session Was With Large Professor|publisher=Stop the Breaks|date=2013-11-05|access-date=2021-12-09}} < /ref >  Nas' first published song was  " Live at the Barbeque "  in 1991. He was a guest artist on this song, which was by the group [[Main Source]]. In 1992, Nas released his first [[Single (music)|single]], a song called  " [[Halftime (song)|Halftime]] " . This song was first published as part of a movie's [[soundtrack]]. < ref name= " Allmusic " > {{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nas-mn0000373634/biography|title=Nas: Artist Biography|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=2021-12-09}} < /ref > 
 
 Nas released his first album, called ''[[Illmatic]]'', in 1994. The album got very good reviews. People especially liked Nas' [[songwriting]] skills on the album. Because it was so well liked, ''Illmatic'' is often called a classic. < ref name= " Allmusic "  / > < ref name= " MTV-1994 " > {{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/123/1994/news_feature_010504/|title=The Year Hip-Hop Was Reborn: A Look Back at 1994|website=[[MTV]] |access-date=2021-12-09|archive-date=2009-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104153747/http://www.mtv.com/bands/123/1994/news_feature_010504/|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >  Today, many people still say that ''Illmatic'' is one of the best hip-hop albums ever. Nas released his second album in 1996. He called the album ''[[It Was Written]]''. On this album, Nas tried to make songs that a bigger audience would like. < ref name= " Allmusic "  / >  He also made expensive [[music video]]s to promote the album. 
 
 Nas also joined a hip hop group called [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]]. The other members of the group were [[Foxy Brown]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], and [[Nature (rapper)|Nature]]. The Firm first appeared as a group on ''It Was Written''. In 1997, The Firm released an album together. The Firm's album sold many copies, but sold less than the group had hoped it would. After this album, The Firm stopped making music as a group. Nas instead started making his third album by himself. He planned to call this album ''I Am... The Autobiography'', and wanted it to be a [[double album]]. People leaked many of the songs from this album onto the Internet before it came out. Because of this, Nas decided to record new songs for the album. < ref > Weinstein, S.  " Nas. "  In Hess, M. (ed.), ''Icons of Hip-Hop'', vol. 1, pp. 341–363. < /ref >  He also changed the title to ''[[I Am... (Nas album)|I Am...]]''. This album came out in 1999. Nas also released another album, called ''[[Nastradamus]]'', in 1999. ''Nastradamus'' was originally meant to have the leaked songs from ''I Am...'', but Nas changed his mind and decided to record new songs for it. < ref name= " Allmusic "  / > 
 
 ===2000s=== 
 In the late 1990s, Nas began feuding with rapper [[Jay-Z]]. In 2001, Jay-Z wrote a song called  " Takeover "  that insulted Nas. Nas replied by writing a song called  " Ether "  that insulted Jay-Z in return.  " Ether "  appeared on Nas' fifth album, ''[[Stillmatic]]'', which he released in 2001. ''Stillmatic'' was mostly well liked. Its good reception helped to boost Nas' career after his last two albums had received bad reviews. Nas' next album was ''[[The Lost Tapes]]'', an album made of songs he had written earlier but never published. ''The Lost Tapes'' got good reviews. Some critics said it was his best album since ''Illmatic''. 
 
 Nas released several more albums in the 2000s. In 2002, he released ''[[God's Son (album)|God's Son]]''. This album sold many copies, causing it to [[Platinum record|go platinum]]. It also included the song  " I Can " , which became Nas' biggest [[hit song]]. After this, Nas' next album was a double album called ''[[Street's Disciple]]''. The album got good reviews, but sold fewer copies than his earlier albums. 
 
 Nas and Jay-Z ended their fued in 2005. To show that they had made up, Nas made a surprise appearance at a Jay-Z concert in 2005. The two musicians performed Jay-Z's song  " Dead Presidents "  together. < ref name= " Allmusic "  / >  At this time, Jay-Z was the president of the [[record label]] [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Nas signed a contract with Def Jam in January 2006. On the Def Jam label, Nas released his next album in 2006. This album was called ''[[Hip Hop Is Dead]]''. The album reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. It was Nas' first number-one album since ''I Am...'', and his third ever. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/nas-scores-third-no-1-album-with-hip-hop-is-dead-56357/|title=Nas Scores Third No. 1 Album With 'Hip-Hop Is Dead'|publisher=Billboard|date=2006-12-27|access-date=2021-12-09}} < /ref >  In 2007, Nas announced that he wanted to call his next album ''Nigger''. Because the title was a racial slur, many people were unhappy with this announcement.

Because of the controversy, Nas decided to release the album [[Untitled Nas album|without any title]] at all. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Ewing|first=Aliya|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7092/title.nas-names-album-nothing-sets-release-date|title=Nas Names Album Nothing  &  Sets Release Date|date=2008-06-10|access-date=2021-12-09|archive-date=2012-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829213210/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7092/title.nas-names-album-nothing-sets-release-date|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >
