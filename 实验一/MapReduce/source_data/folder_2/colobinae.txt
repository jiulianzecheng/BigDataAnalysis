 The '''Colobinae''' are a [[family (biology)|subfamily]] of [[Old World monkey]]s. < ref > Groves, Colin; Wilson D.E.  &  Reeder D.M. (eds) 2005. ''Mammal species of the world''. 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 152-178. {{ISBN|0-801-88221-4}} < /ref >  The family includes 61 [[species]] in 11 [[genus|genera]], including the ''[[Colobus]]'' monkeys, the large-nosed [[proboscis monkey]], and the [[grey langur]]s. 
 
 Some classifications split the '''colobine''' monkeys into two tribes, while others split them into three groups. Both classifications put the three African genera ''Colobus'', ''Piliocolobus'', and ''Procolobus'' in one group; these genera are distinct because they have stub thumbs (Greek κολοβός ''kolobós'' =  " docked " ). 
 
 The various Asian genera are placed into one or two groups. Analysis of [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] shows the Asian species form two distinct groups, one of langurs and the other of the  " odd-nosed "  species. The grey langurs are not closely related to either. < ref name=Sterner2006 > Sterner, Kirstin N. ''et al'' 2006. Mitochondrial data support an odd-nosed colobine clade.
