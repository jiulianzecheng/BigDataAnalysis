 '''Gabbro''' is a large group of dark, coarse-grained, [[igneous rock]]s. They are chemically equivalent to [[basalt]]. The rocks are [[Intrusive|plutonic]], formed when molten [[magma]] is trapped under the [[Earth]]'s surface and cools into a [[crystal]]line mass.  
 
 Most of the Earth's surface has gabbro in the [[oceanic crust]], produced by basalt [[magma]]tism at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. In general, when the gabbro is formed, it lies above the [[Earth's mantle]], and below the basalt. 
 
 Gabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or greater. It is an essential part of the [[oceanic crust]]. Long belts of gabbro intrusions < ref > Intrusion: pushed its way between other rocks < /ref >  are typically formed at proto-[[Rift (geology)|rift zone]]s and around ancient rift zone margins.
