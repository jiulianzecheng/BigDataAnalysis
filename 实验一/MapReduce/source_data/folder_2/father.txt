[[File:Father's love.jpg|thumb|A father with his [[son]]]] 
 A '''father''' (also called '''dad''' or '''daddy''') is a [[male]] [[parent]]. Most [[human]] beings are born from a [[mother]] and a father. The father of a person's [[husband]] or [[wife]] is their [[father-in-law]]. Fathers determine the gender of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X [[chromosome]] ([[female]]), or Y chromosome ([[male]]).
