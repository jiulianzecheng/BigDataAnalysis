A '''hallmark''' is an official mark or series of marks struck on items made of [[metal]]. The purpose is to certify the content of metals such as [[platinum]], [[gold]], [[silver]] and in some countries, [[palladium]].  
 
 In a more general sense, the term 'hallmark' can also be used to refer to any characteristic which signifies (signals) quality. So, in the 19th/20th centuries, marking [[steel]] [[cutlery]] as  " made in [[Sheffield]] "  was a guarantee of its quality. Historically, hallmarks were applied by a trusted party: the  " guardians of the craft "  or, more recently, by an assay office. Hallmarks are a guarantee of certain purity or fineness of the metal, as determined by official metal (assay) testing.
