 '''Tehran''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: تهران), is the [[capital (city)|capital]] of [[Iran]] and the center of [[Tehran Province]]. 
 The origin of the name Tehran is unknown. The word Tehran means ''warm mountain slope''. Tehran is at the foot of the [[Alborz mountain range]]. 
 
 Tehran is the 32nd National Capital of Iran. It is the largest [[city]] in the [[Middle East]]  &  Western [[Asia]]. It is the 16th most populated city in the [[world]]. It has about 8 million people. Tehran has 4 counties: Tehran, Shemiranat, Rey  &  Islamshahr. Tehran has a large  network of [[highway]]s. 
 
 ==History== 
 Tehran was well known as a [[village]] in the [[9th century]], but was less well-known than the city of Rhages (Ray). Tehran today, replaces [[Ray]], the ancient capital of Iran destroyed by the [[Mongols]] in 1220 A.D., the ruins of which can be seen 6 & nbsp;km south of Tehran. In 1869/70 A.D., Tehran acquired considerable prestige and was enclosed in an 8 & nbsp;km rampart which had 12 gates. 
 
 During the Safavid period, Shah Safi created a military base in Tehran, and had two great [[tower]]s erected therein, which became known as ''Ghaleh Meydan'' and ''Ghaleh Hessa''. ''Karim Khan Zand'' lived in Tehran. for 4 years. In the early 18th century, ''Karim Khan Zand'', ordered a palace, and a government office to be built in Tehran. Later he moved his government capital to [[Shiraz]]. 
 
 Tehran became the capital of Iran, in 1795, when Agha Mohammad Khan, became King. It is still the capital. During the reign of Agha Mohammad khan, the government headquarters were built north of ''Emam_zade Zayd''. Agha Mohammad Khan became King of Iran in ''Khalvat Karimkhani Palace'' in Tehran. During the reign of Fath Ali Shah, the soltani mosque, the Abbas_abad bazaar, and the Ilchi garden (the site of today`s [[Russia]]n [[embassy]]) were added. Nasser_e_din_Shah changed the palace from center of Tehran to Sadabad. He changed the view of Tehran from a [[town]] to a [[modern]] [[Capital (city)|capital]]. 
 
 In the Russia Embassy in Iran, the ''Tehran Conference'' was held. The Tehran Conference (codenamed ''Eureka'') was the meeting of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] between November 28 and December 1, 1943. Most of it was held at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, [[Iran]]. It was the first [[World War II]] conference amongst the [[Allies of World War II|Big Three]] (the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]) where Stalin was present. The aim of the Tehran conference was to plan the final strategy for the war against [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies. The discussion was mostly about the opening of a second front in Western [[Europe]]. 
 
 During 1980–88, Tehran was attacked by scud missiles and air strikes. After the [[Islamic Revolution]] in Iran and during war between Iran and [[Iraq]], many people left Tehran. In recent years, many professional people who lived in Tehran, left Iran for [[freedom]] and a better [[life]] in other countries. [[Traffic]], [[crime]], [[Illegal drugs|drugs]] and lack of freedom in Tehran, are most important reasons.
