 An '''ocean''' is a large area of water between [[continent]]s. Oceans are very big and they join smaller [[sea]]s together. Oceans (or marine [[biome]]s) cover 72% of Earth. < ref name= " blue-planet " > {{cite book|title=Blue Planet|author=Dinorah Pous|publisher=McGrawHill|year=2010|location=New York|pages=117}} < /ref >  There are five main oceans: the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Southern Ocean]], and the [[Arctic Ocean]]. 
 
 The largest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. The smallest ocean is the Arctic Ocean. Many types of animals live in oceans, such as carp, crabs, starfish, sharks, and whales. 
 Different water movements separate the [[Southern Ocean]] from the [[Atlantic]], [[Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. The Southern Ocean is also called the [[Antarctic Ocean]], because it covers the area around [[Antarctica]]. 
 
 The deepest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. The deep ocean is characterized by cold temperatures, high pressure, and complete darkness. Some very unusual organisms live in this part of the ocean. They do not require energy from the sun to survive, because they use chemicals from deep inside the Earth. 
 
 == Color  == 
 Although many people believe that the oceans are blue because the water reflects the blue sky, this is actually not true. Water has a very slight blue color that can only be seen when there is a lot of water. However, the main cause of the blue or blue/green color of the oceans is that water [[absorption|absorbs]] the red part of the incoming light, and reflects the green and blue part of the light. We then see the reflected light as the color of water.

 == Plants and animals == 
 Many organisms live in oceans. Organisms that live in oceans can live in salt water. They are affected by sunlight, temperature, water pressure, and water movement. Different ocean organisms live near the surface, in shallow waters, and in deep waters. Small [[plant]] organisms that live near the surface and use sunlight to produce food are called [[phytoplankton]]. Almost all animals in the ocean depend directly or indirectly on these plants. In shallow water, you may find lobsters and crabs. In deeper water, marine animals of many different shapes and sizes swim through the ocean. These include many types of [[fish]], such as [[tuna]], [[swordfish]] and [[marine mammal]]s like [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s. The skies above the open ocean are home to large sea birds, such as the [[albatross]]. < ref name=blue-planet/ > 
 
 == Harvesting the ocean == 
 Nations like [[Russia]] and [[Japan]] have lots of huge ships that go to some of the world's best fishing areas for many months. These large ships have libraries, hospitals, schools, repair (fixing) shops and other things that are needed for fishermen and their families. 
 
 Many people look at the sea as a source of food, minerals and energy. 
 
 == Fishing == 
 According to the ''FishBase.org'' website, there are 33,200 known fish species, many of which live in the oceans. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |title=FishBase. |access-date=2015-09-14 |archive-date=2017-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823230232/http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |url-status=live }} < /ref >   Many of these fish are a fine source of [[protein]], so many people eat them. Fishing [[wikt:industry|industries]] is very important because they make jobs and give food to millions of people. Today, usually through ocean fishing, the ocean supplies about 2% of the [[calorie]]s needed by [[human|people]]. < ref name=fishy > {{cite book | last = Sherwin| first = Frank| title = The Ocean Book| publisher = Master Books| date = 2004| location = P.O. Box 726, Green Forest, AR 72638| isbn = 0-89051-401-1}} < /ref >  Tuna, [[anchovy|anchovies]], and herring are harvested close to the surface of the ocean. < ref name=fishy/ >  Pollock, [[flounder]], and cod are caught near the ocean floor. < ref name=fishy/ >  More than a million tons of herring are caught every year in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, and almost eight fish out of ten fish are eaten as food for humans. The other fish are used as [[fertilizer]], [[glue]], and pet and other animal food. < ref name=fishy/ > 
 
 == Ocean temperatures == 
 There are many different ocean temperatures in the open ocean, both vertically (from top to bottom) and [[wikt:horizontal|horizontally]]. [[Iceberg]]s are made over very cold waters at either pole, while waters at the [[equator]] are pretty warm. < ref name=fishy/ >  Water cools and warms more slowly than land does, so land influenced by the ocean has later and milder seasons than land that is farther away from the ocean. 
 
 The surface part of the ocean, also called the ''mixed layer'', is not much colder even when we go deeper down. < ref name=fishy/ >  Below this surface zone is a layer of sudden temperature difference, called a ''thermocline''. This is a middle layer hat is from the surface zone down to about 2,600 feet (800 m). Thermoclines may happen only at seasons or [[wikt:permanent|permanently]], and may change depending on where and how deep it is. As evaporation happens, it begins cooling, and if the water evaporates very quickly, the water becomes saltier. The salty, cold water is [[wikt:dense|denser]], so it sinks. This is why warm and cold waters do not easily mix. Most animals and plants live in the warm upper layer. Below the thermocline, the temperature in the deep zone is so cold it is just above freezing - between {{convert|32|-|37.4|°F|°C|0}}. < ref name=fishy/ >
