{{For|the computer virus|AIDS (MS-DOS)}}[[File:Hiv budding.jpg|right|thumb|HIV virus going out of a cell]]'''Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome''' or '''Acquired immune deficiency syndrome''' ('''AIDS''') is a [[disease]] caused by a [[virus]] called [[HIV]]. 
 * ''Acquired'' means that people are not born with the disease. They get it after being infected with the HIV virus. 
 * ''Immune'' or ''Immuno-'' talks about the [[immune system]]. The immune system is the part of the body that fights off [[infectious disease|disease]]. 
 * ''Deficiency'' means not to be enough. An ''immuno-deficiency'' is a problem where the immune system is damaged and cannot fight off diseases to keep the body healthy. 
 * ''Syndrome'' is a collection of [[symptom]]s, or problems in the body. Because the immune system is damaged, and cannot fight off disease, people with AIDS get a collection of symptoms which is referred to as the  " Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. " 
 
 == How many people have AIDS? == 
 As of 2018, it is estimated that there are 39.7 million people worldwide infected with [[HIV]]. < ref name= " avert " > {{cite web|title=Worldwide AIDS  &  HIV Statistics|url=http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm|work=[[AVERT]]|date=31 December 2009|access-date=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xl1NEOLZ?url=http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm|archive-date=7 April 2011|url-status=live}} < /ref >  The HIV [[pandemic]] is most severe in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Over 60% of all people with HIV live in the region. 
 
 Many people with HIV do not know they have it. Because of this, the exact number of people with HIV is unknown. 
 
 == Where HIV started == 
 Scientists believe the first human who got HIV was a person in Africa in the early 1900s. It infected only a small amount of people (disease not recognised), until it then turned into an epidemic reported to have started in New York (USA) in 1981. It then very quickly started spreading to other countries. This happened when '''S'''imian '''I'''mmunodeficiency '''V'''irus (SIV) went from [[apes]] or [[chimpanzee]]s to humans. This virus probably crossed to humans when a hunter came into contact with monkey blood while cutting up monkeys to eat. < ref name= " Aids: Origin of pandemic 'was 1920s Kinshasa' " > Aids: Origin of pandemic 'was 1920s Kinshasa': [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29442642 BBC News - Aids: Origin of pandemic 'was 1920s Kinshasa'] < /ref >  Research in October 2014 shows that the virus started in Kinshasa during the 1920s. < ref name= " Aids: Origin of pandemic 'was 1920s Kinshasa' " / >  It was quickly spread by unprotected sex, dirty needles used by intravenous drug users, and it then made its way into the medical blood supply . < ref name= " Aids: Origin of pandemic 'was 1920s Kinshasa' " / >  Some people described the spread of the disease as a ''sexidemic'' (widespread). < ref > Sontag, Susan.  " From: AIDS and its Metaphors 1989. "  (2003): 127-135. < /ref > 
 
 == HIV and AIDS == 
 Not everyone who has HIV has AIDS. When people first get HIV, they can be [[healthy]] for years. A person is diagnosed as having AIDS when he or she gets specific types of illnesses or gets sick in certain ways due to their HIV. Once a person's HIV progresses to (or turns into) AIDS, the person will continue to have AIDS for the rest of their life. While there are many treatments for HIV/AIDS, at this point there is no cure. 
 
 If someone has HIV they are called ''HIV-positive''. 
 
 Someone has AIDS if they have HIV and either: 
 * [[Blood]] tests that show very low numbers of [[white blood cell]]s – special cells that fight infections 
 * [[AIDS defining illness]]es (illness is another word for [[disease]].) 
 
 === AIDS-defining illnesses === 
 If a person gets an  " AIDS-defining illness, "  this is usually a sign that the person has AIDS. Healthy people do not get these illnesses, because a healthy immune system is strong enough to fight off these diseases. Because of this, getting an AIDS-defining illness is a sign that a person's immune system is seriously damaged. In a person with HIV, getting an AIDS-defining illness signals that the HIV has damaged the immune system badly enough that the person now has AIDS. 
 
 Some AIDS defining illnesses are: 
 * [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] – a type of [[cancer]] that usually affects the skin (often causing red or purple lesions, or wounds, on the skin). Sometimes KS only affects the skin; sometimes it also affects other systems in the body. 
 * [[CMV retinitis]] – a [[virus]] that infects the back of the [[eye]]. 
 * [[Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia]] ([[acronym]] PCP) – a type of [[pneumonia]], an [[infectious disease]] of the [[lung]]. PCP is the most common infection in AIDS patients. 
 * [[Toxoplasmosis]] – a parasitic disease (a disease caused by a [[parasite]]), which can cause problems in the [[brain]] as well as other systems in the body. 
 * Invasive [[cervical cancer]] – cancer of the bottom part of a woman's [[uterus]]. Invasive means the cancer has spread. 
 
 === How is HIV spread? === 
 HIV can be spread by some body [[fluid]]s that have HIV in them: < ref name= " transmission " > {{cite web |url=https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/how-you-get-hiv-aids/ |title=How Do You Get HIV or AIDS? |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=August 27, 2015 |website=www.aids.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |access-date=December 25, 2015 }} < /ref > 
 * [[Blood]] 
 * [[Semen]] 
 * Fluids from a woman's [[vagina]] 
 * Fluids from the [[rectum]] 
 * Breast milk 
 * From infected mother to child during pregnancy (Transplacental). 
 This means a person can get HIV by: < ref name= " transmission "  / > 
 * Having [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with a person with HIV without using [[condom]]s or other types of protection 
 ** This includes [[anal sex]] and (sometimes) [[oral sex]] 
 * Sharing [[needle]]s with someone who has HIV (to [[Injection|inject]] [[illegal drugs]] like [[heroin]]) 
 * Getting stuck with a needle that has been used on someone with HIV (this happens sometimes to healthcare workers like [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[nurse]]s) 
 * A mother with HIV can pass HIV on to her baby while she is [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] or if she [[Breastfeeding|breast-feeds]] the baby 
 
 === How is HIV  < u > not < /u >  spread? === 
 HIV is NOT spread by: < ref name= " transmission "  / > 
 * Body fluids like [[saliva]] (spit), [[tears]], or [[sweat]] 
 * Touching a person with HIV (like [[shaking hands]] or [[hug]]ging) 
 * Sharing dishes or drinking from the same glass as someone with HIV 
 * Light switches or toilet seats 
 * Drinking fountains 
 * Air or water 
 * [[Insect]]s, like [[mosquito]]es 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 There are medicines that help people with AIDS. These are called ''antiretroviral'' medicines (or ''antiretrovirals''.) Anti- means against. HIV is a retrovirus. So ''antiretroviral'' means it fights retroviruses. 
 
 Antiretrovirals cannot cure AIDS. This means they cannot make all of the virus leave a person's body. But they can make people with AIDS more [[health]]y. Antiretrovirals help people fight the HIV virus. This makes their immune systems work better. So antiretrovirals are a ''treatment'' but not a ''cure'' for HIV. 
 
 People with HIV/AIDS who take antiretroviral medicines live longer. They live longer without getting ''AIDS defining illnesses''. But after a long time, the HIV virus learns how to fight the antiretrovirals. The HIV virus is not killed by this medicine. HIV becomes ''resistant'' to the medicine. Then the ''resistant'' HIV hurts the immune system and the person may get AIDS. 
 
 Sometimes when HIV is resistant to one medicine, another medicine can be used. To make less resistance happen, people with AIDS take more than one medicine at the same time. They may take 2–4 medicines at once. This is sometimes called a ''cocktail'' or ''AIDS cocktail''. 
 
 When HIV gets resistant to one medicine, this is changed to another medicine. So the ''AIDS cocktail'' that people with AIDS take changes over time. But after a long time, the HIV learns to be resistant to ''many'' drugs. This is called ''multi-drug-resistant'' (acronym MDR) HIV. After the HIV in a person has MDR-HIV there may be no more medicines to treat them. So [[scientist]]s keep trying to find new medicines to fight HIV. 
 The five most important HIV medicines are: 
 * D4T (stavudine) 
 * 3TC (Lamivudine) 
 * NVP (nevirapine) 
 * AZT (zidovudine) 
 * EFZ (efavirenz) 
 
 == HIV orphans == 
 [[File:Africa HIV-AIDS 2002.png|right|frame|Percent of people with HIV in Africa in 1999–2001]] 
 Many people who die of AIDS, especially in [[Africa]], leave behind children who are still alive, and may need help. These children are called [[AIDS orphan]]s. 
 
 == Ways to stop AIDS == 
 There are many ways people fight the ''AIDS [[epidemic]]''. 
 
 === Education === 
 The most important way to stop HIV/AIDS is [[education]]. People can get HIV from the exchange of bodily fluids and from sharing needles. Children can also get HIV from their mothers (when they grow inside pregnant mothers and when they drink breast milk.) 
 Sex is one way to get HIV. If people use [[condom]]s when they have sex, there is a much smaller chance of catching HIV. 
 
 A person can also get HIV by ''sharing [[needle]]s''. This means using a needle that has not been cleaned after someone else has used it. Some people who take [[illegal]] drugs like [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] take these drugs by needle. Some of these people share needles. If one person has HIV and he shares his needles, he can give HIV to other people. But if people have clean needles or if they know how to clean needles, they do not get HIV as much. 
 
 Many people do not know that condoms and clean needles help stop HIV. They may not even ''know'' that sharing needles and sex with someone who has HIV can make them get HIV. Even if people know about condoms and clean needles, they may not ''have'' condoms and clean needles. 
 
 === Safe sex and needle exchange === 
 There are some people who do not want people to ''know'' about condoms or clean needles. They believe that if people know about condoms and have condoms they will have more sex. They believe that if people have clean needles they will use illegal drugs more. Many of these people think this because of their [[religion]]. For example, the [[Catholic]] church does not want people to have or use condoms. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_doc_20010627_declaration-aids_en.html|title=Statement of interpretation of the Holy See on the adoption of the declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS|date=27 June 2001|publisher=Holy See|access-date=2011-01-19}} < /ref >  They do not want people to have condoms because they do not think people should have sex unless they are [[marriage|married]]. They also think that married people should not use condoms, because they believe that if people have sex, they should be prepared to accept a possible pregnancy. 
 
 [[Scientist]]s who study (look at and learn about) people who use condoms, see that if teenagers (children 13–19) learn about condoms (and other [[birth control]]) they have ''less'' unsafe sex. Scientists see that learning about these things does not make teenagers start having sex earlier. The teenagers also have ''safer'' sex. Safer sex means doing things (like wearing condoms) to try not to get pregnant or get [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs or STIs) like HIV, [[gonorrhea]], and [[syphilis]]. Using a condom works '''''very''''' well for keeping people from getting pregnant or getting STDs if people know how to [[condom|use a condom the right way]].{{ref|aids1}} {{ref|aids2}} 
 
 Scientists have also learned that if a city has a [[needle exchange program]] it will have fewer people who use illegal drugs. ''Needle exchange programs'' are where people can come in and trade dirty needles for clean needles. This means that ''if'' they use drugs they will be more safe. But needle exchange programs do more than give people clean needles. They teach people about drugs. If people want to stop using drugs, they help them. 
 
 === HIV vaccine === 
 The best way to stop HIV is thought to be a [[vaccine]]. There is no vaccine for HIV yet. Many scientists are looking for an HIV vaccine. Even one that protected some people from HIV would save millions of people's lives. 
 
 == Wrong ideas == 
 Some people think that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. They dispute the connection between HIV and AIDS, < ref name= " Duesberg " > {{cite journal| author=Duesberg, P.

 Some [[conspiracy theories]] have been put about. [[Operation INFEKTION]] was a worldwide Soviet [[active measures]] operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS. Surveys show that a significant number of people believed – and continue to believe – in such claims. < ref name= " infektion " > {{cite web|last=Boghardt|first=Thomas|title=Operation INFEKTION Soviet Bloc Intelligence and its AIDS Disinformation Campaign|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/soviet-bloc-intelligence-and-its-aids.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|year=2009|access-date=2016-03-02|archive-date=2010-03-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324175920/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/soviet-bloc-intelligence-and-its-aids.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
