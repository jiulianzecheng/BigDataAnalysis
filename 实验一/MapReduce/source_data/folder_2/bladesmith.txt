Bladesmiths are people who create anything that has a blade whether it be a chef's knife to a crusader [[sword]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What does BLADESMITH mean?|url=https://www.definitions.net/definition/BLADESMITH|access-date=2021-11-23|website=www.definitions.net}} < /ref >  Bladesmiths use various metalworking techniques to forge blades, [[woodworking]] skills for knife and sword handles, and leatherworking knowledge to make sheaths. 
 
 Knife forging dates back millions of years. The oldest known knives were made by humans 2.5 million years ago and consisted of rock, bone, and flint. These materials were brittle, and blades often fractured. So over 6,000 years ago, humans turned to more robust materials, including [[copper]] and later [[iron]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Bladesmithing 101: Beginners Guide to Becoming a Bladesmith|url=https://www.thecrucible.org/guides/bladesmithing/|access-date=2021-11-23|website=The Crucible|language=en-US}} < /ref >
