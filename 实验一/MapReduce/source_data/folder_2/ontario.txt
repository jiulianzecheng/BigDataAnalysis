 '''Ontario''' is a [[province]] of [[Canada]]. It is in the eastern half of Canada, between [[Manitoba]] and [[Quebec]]. Ontario has [[population|the most people]] of any province, with 13,150,000 in 2009, and is home to the biggest city in Canada, [[Toronto]], which is also the [[capital city|capital]] of the province. In the eastern part of the province, placed on the [[border]] with Quebec, is [[Ottawa]], the capital of Canada, located on the [[Ottawa River]]. 
 
 Ontario also has the second largest [[size|land area]], with 1,076,395 & nbsp;km²; only [[Quebec]] is larger by size. ([[Nunavut]] and [[Northwest Territories]] are also larger, but are called ''territories'' and not ''provinces''). The province has one of the longest borders with the [[United States]] and there are several [[border crossing]]s including the one at [[Niagara Falls]]. Along this border are 4 large lakes called [[Lake Ontario]], [[Lake Erie]], [[Lake Huron]], and [[Lake Superior]]. They each are partly in Ontario and partly in the United States, and the border runs through them, but not [[Lake Michigan]], which is entirely in the United States. These five lakes are together are called the [[Great Lakes]]. 
 
 There are a number of [[symbol]]s that represent the province of Ontario. The [[flag]] is red with the British [[Union Jack]] in the top left corner and the provincial [[shield]] is on the right hand side of the flag. The provincial [[bird]] is the [[loon]], and the provincial [[flower]] is the [[trillium]]. It has three flower [[petal]]s and it is usually white but some times is pink or purple. 
 
 < !--The province (like all provinces and territories in [[Canada]]) is handled by the province ministry. Public and Catholic elementary, middle and high schools are funded by the government. The [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma]] is also issued by the ministry.-- > 
 ==History== 
 Ontario became part of Canada when it was created in 1867. Before 1840, it was known as Upper Canada, which was a [[colony]] in the [[British Empire]]. Between 1840 and 1867 it was known as Canada West. The [[government]] of Ontario sits at [[Queen's Park]] in Toronto. The leader of the government is called the ''[[Premier]]'', and [[Premier of Ontario|the current Premier]] is [[Doug Ford]]. There is also a [[Lieutenant Governor]] who represents the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]], and [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|the current Lieutenant Governor]] is Edith Dumont. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Ontario is very large, so sometimes people break it into two. The two parts are called [[Northern Ontario]] and [[Southern Ontario]]. Most of the people in Ontario live in the south, and that is where the big cities are. The big cities in [[Southern Ontario]] are Toronto and the rest of the [[Greater Toronto Area]], Ottawa and the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Sarnia]]. The cities in the north are smaller. In the far north of Ontario hardly any people live at all, and there are no [[road]]s or [[railway]]s making it difficult to even get to those places. 
 
 Much of Ontario gets lots of snow in the winter. In the summer, it can get very hot in the south parts. In some big cities, there is [[smog]] in the summer.
