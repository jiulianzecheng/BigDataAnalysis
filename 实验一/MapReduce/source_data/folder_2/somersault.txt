 A '''somersault''' is an [[acrobatics|acrobatic]] move where a person moves the [[foot|feet]] over the [[head]] whilst in mid-air. The somersault can be done forwards, backwards, or sideways and is similar to a ''flip'' (or, if performed backwards, a ''backflip'').  
 A backwards somersault while still moving forward is called a ''Gainer'' 
 
 The word comes from the old [[French language|French]] word ''sombresault'', which is no longer used.
