 '''Cladotheria''' is a [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] group. It includes two of the three living groups of [[Mammal|mammals]]. These are the [[Placental mammal|placental mamnals]] and the [[Marsupial|marsupials]]. The [[Monotreme|monotremes]] are not in this group, but all other living mammals are in the group. < ref name= " Rowe1988 " > {{cite journal|last1=Rowe|first1=Timothy|title=Definition, diagnosis, and origin of Mammalia|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=8|issue=3|year=1988|pages=241–264|issn=0272-4634|doi=10.1080/02724634.1988.10011708}} < /ref > 
 
 The Cladotheria also includes some groups which have become [[Extinction|extinct]]. < ref > Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, Richard L. Cifelli, and Zhe-Xi Luo 2004. ''Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs: origins, evolution, and structure''. New York: Columbia University Press. < /ref >

 * They give birth to live young (as opposed to the egg-laying monotremes) 
 * They have two separate openings, one for the [[anus]], and the other one for the [[urethra]] (the monotremes have just one opening) 
 * The [[shoulder]] area only has two bones, the [[scapula]] (shoulder blade), and the [[clavicle|clavicula]] 
 * The [[Mammary gland|mammary glands]] are connected to [[Teat|teats]] 
 * Their skull has a common layout 
 * On their face they have [[Hair|hairs]] called [[Whisker|whiskers]] which are sensitive to touch.
