 '''Isocrates'''  ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|k|r|ə|t|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc|Ἰσοκράτης}} {{IPA-el|isokrátɛ̂ːs|}}; 436–338 BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[teacher]] of [[rhetoric]] and was one of the ten {{ill|Attic orators|en}}. He was one of the leading Greek rhetorical speakers of his time and contributed to rhetoric and [[education]] through his teaching and written works. 
 
 Some people say {{ill|Tisias|en}}, a [[student|pupil]] of {{ill|Corax of Syracuse|en}}, was the teacher of Isocrates. Within two generations, rhetoric had become an important art, its growth driven by social and political changes such as [[democracy]] and [[Court|courts of law]]. Isocrates starved himself to death, two years before his 100th birthday. < ref > {{Cite web |last=Phillips |first=David D. |date=27 March 2003 |title=Orator Biographies |url=http://www.stoa.org/demos/article_orator_biographies%40page%3D5%26greekEncoding%3DUnicodeC.html |access-date=7 September 2020 |website=stoa.org |publisher=The Stoa |archive-date=28 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028094115/http://www.stoa.org/demos/article_orator_biographies%40page%3D5%26greekEncoding%3DUnicodeC.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |last=Potter |first=Ben |date=17 April 2015 |title=Isocrates: The Essayist |url=https://classicalwisdom.com/people/isocrates-essayist/ |access-date=7 September 2020 |website= Classical Wisdom Weekly |quote=In 338 BC, two years shy of Alexander's coronation and his own 100th birthday, Isocrates starved himself to death after yet another appeal to Philip fell on deaf ears.}} < /ref >
