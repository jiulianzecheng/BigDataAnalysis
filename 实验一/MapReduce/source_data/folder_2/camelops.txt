 '''''Camelops''''' is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of [[camel]] which lived in [[North America]] during the [[Pleistocene]]. from two [[million]] years ago to about 10,000 years ago. 
 
 They were [[prey]] for the [[wolves]], [[Arctodus|bears]], [[American lion|lions]] and ''[[Smilodon]]''. ''Camelops'' disappeared at the end of the last [[ice age]], as did many other animals. 
 
 == Changes in their environment == 
 Evidence of its [[environment]] comes from Natural Trap Cave in [[Wyoming]], < ref name=Quart > Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. (eds) 1984. ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. Arizona, Tucson AZ, p145. {{ISBN|0-8165-1100-4}} < /ref >  and from [[Rancho La Brea]] in the modern [[Los Angeles]] area. < ref name= " San " > Western Camel (extinct)  
 ''Camelops hesternus''. San Diego Natural History Museum [http://www.sdnhm.org/archive/exhibits/mystery/fg_camel.html] < /ref >  These studies suggest that it was not, like modern camels, adapted to [[desert]] conditions. It lived in [[woodland]] and [[grasslands]] with mixed vegetation. 
 
 Before the climate change at about 11,000 years ago it lived in  " [[conifer]] parklands "  on the [[Montana]]-Wyoming border, < ref name=Quart/ >  and in  " coastal [[shrub]]lands "  in [[California]]. < ref name=San/ >  After the climate change, what had been woodland became  " deserts and treeless [[steppe]]s of the sort so extensive in the present western U.S.A " . Even the type of grass which grew there changed. < ref name=Quart/ > 
 
 Evidently, for this animal, the [[climate change]] was very significant. Also, the arrival of man as a [[hunter]] may have made the situation worse. A few [[Clovis point]]s have been found in the cave site.
