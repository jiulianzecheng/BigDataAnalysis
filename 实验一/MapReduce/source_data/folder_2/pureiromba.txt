 == History == 
 According to the [[Thalon]] text, Pureiromba ({{lang-omp|Puleilompa}}) was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the [[Nongmaiching Hill|Selloi Langmai Hill]] ([[Nongmaiching Hill]]). Before the Meitei King [[Ura Konthouba]] (c. 7th century CE) killed all the Selloi Langmai people, the cults of these five gods were put together into that of a single God with the name  " Langmai Ningthou "  (lit. ''King of the Langmais''). The personal names became the other names or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people became one chiefdom. This chiefdom later became the [[Angom|Angom clan]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgHgCwAAQBAJ & dq=pureiromba & pg=PA79|title=Meeyamgi Kholao: Sprout of Consciousness|last=Birajit|first=Soibam|date=2014-12-01|publisher=ARECOM ( Advanced Research Consortium, Manipur)|language=en|pages=79}} < /ref >

 The people who worship Pureiromba ({{lang-omp|Puleilompa}}) think of him as their ancestor. However, no one knows if he was a real person from history or a god that acted like a human.
