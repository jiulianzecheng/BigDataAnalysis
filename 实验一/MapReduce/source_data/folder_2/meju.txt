 ''Meju'' was commonly made in any Korean home in the past. Condiments made with mejus all tasted different because the production of meju was not standardized. As many Koreans now buy Korean traditional condiments instead of making them, it is difficult to find the wide variety of unique tasting condiments made from homemade meju. 
 
 == History == 
 The meaning of the word ‘meju’ originally included all condiments and seasonings made with meju. However, as another word ‘jang’ was used more frequently to refer to condiments made with meju, the meaning of the word ‘meju’ shifted to refer only to the stage before it is used in condiments. Scholars believe the Japanese word ‘[[miso]]’ which is similar to Korean [[doenjang]] came from the word ‘meju’. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=545713 & cid=1647 & categoryId=1647 |title=메주 : 지식백과 |first= |last= |work=naver.com |year=2014  |accessdate=14 June 2014}} < /ref >
