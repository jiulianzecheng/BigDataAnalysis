The '''Nematophytes''' are a [[paraphyletic]] group of land organisms, probably including some plants as well as [[algae]]. < ref > Smith M.R.  &  Butterfield N.J. 2013.

 The lack of a clear [[definition]] of the nematophytes has led to it being used as a [[wastebasket taxon]]. All manner of tubes and cell-patterned [[cuticle]]s from the Silurian are called  " nematophytic " .
