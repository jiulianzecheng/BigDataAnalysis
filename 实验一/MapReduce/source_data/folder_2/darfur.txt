 '''Darfur''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] دار فور, meaning  " home of the [[Fur people|Fur]] " ) is a region of far western [[Sudan]]. 
 
 It borders the [[Central African Republic]], [[Libya]], and [[Chad]]. It is divided into three federal states within [[Sudan]]: Gharb Darfur ([[West Darfur]]), Janub Darfur ([[South Darfur]]), and Shamal Darfur ([[North Darfur]]). Since 2003 there has been an ongoing [[humanitarian]] crisis that developed from the conflict between [[Ganjaweed]] militias and  the [[Sudan Liberation Movement]] and [[Justice and Equality Movement]]. 
 
 == Geography and climate == 
 [[File:Map of Darfur 2011.png|right|thumb|The country of Sudan, with Darfur in darker yellow]] 
 Darfur covers an area of about 493 & nbsp;180 & nbsp;km² (196,555 miles²)—just over two-thirds the size of [[France]] and more than half the size of [[Kenya]]. It is largely an [[arid]] plateau with the ''Marrah Mountains'' (Jebel Marra), a range of volcanic peaks rising up to 3000 & nbsp;m (10,100 & nbsp;ft), in the center. The region's main towns are [[Al Fashir]], [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]], and [[Geneina]]. 
 
 There are four main features of the physical geography. The whole eastern half of Darfur is covered with plains and low hills of sandy soils, known as ''goz'', and [[sandstone]] hills. In many places the ''goz'' is waterless and can only be inhabited where there are water reservoirs or deep [[borehole]]s. To the north the ''goz'' is overtaken by the desert sands of the [[Sahara]]. A second feature are the ''[[wadi]]s'', seasonal watercourses ranging from small rivulets that flood only occasionally during the wet season to large ''wadis'' that flood for most of the rains and flow from western Darfur hundreds of miles west to [[Lake Chad]]. Many ''wadis'' have pans of [[alluvium]] with rich soil that are also difficult to cultivate. The west of Darfur is dominated by the third feature, [[basement rock]], sometimes covered with a thin layer of sandy soil. Basement rock is too infertile to be farmed, but provides some forest cover that can be grazed by animals. The fourth and final feature is the [[Marrah Mountains]], that rise up to a peak at [[Deriba crater]] where there is a small area of temperate climate, high rainfall and permanent springs of water. 
 
 The rainy season is from June through September, transforming much of the region from dusty brown to green. Because much of the population of Darfur is agricultural, the rains are vital. In normal years, a crop is ready to be harvested by November. Once harvested, the dry stalks may be fed to domestic livestock. In the far northern desert, years may pass between rainfall. In the far south, annual average rainfall is 700 & nbsp;mm and many trees remain green year-round. < ref > de Waal, Alex, ''Famine that Kills: Darfur, Sudan'', [[Oxford University Press]] (Revised edition), 2005, {{ISBN|0-19-518163-8}}, p. 36 < /ref > 
 
 == Economy and demography == 
 
 Darfur has a population of about 7.4 million people. Darfur's economy is primarily based on [[subsistence agriculture]], producing [[cereal]]s, [[fruit]] and [[tobacco]] as well as [[livestock]] in the drier north.  Darfur  suffers from frequent [[drought]] < nowiki/ > s during the summer and heavy rainfall in the winter. < ref > [http://www.darfurscores.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224011543/http://www.darfurscores.com/|date=2011-02-24}} ''Darfur'' < /ref >  This has caused many farmers to provide inadequate crops causing the deaths of thousands of people.

 == Darfur Conflict == 
 {{main|Darfur conflict}} 
 The Darfur conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the [[Janjaweed]] militia group and the tribes of the region. The United Nations estimates that over 400,000 people have died since the beginning of this conflict. < ref > [http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=19948 & Cr=sudan & Cr1=] ''United Nations'' < /ref >
