 '''Erinaceidae''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] in the [[mammal]]ian [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Eulipotyphla]]. It contains the well-known [[hedgehog]]s of Eurasia and Africa and the moonrats of South-east Asia. This family was once in the order [[Insectivora]], but that  order is not used anymore. 
 
 ==Characteristics== 
 Erinaceids are generally [[shrew]]-like in form, with long snouts and short tails,  but they are much larger than shrews. All but one species have five toes in each foot (in some cases with strong claws for digging) and they have large eyes and ears. Hedgehogs have hair modified into sharp [[spine (zoology)|spines]] to form a protective covering over the upper body and flanks, while gymnures have only normal hair. Most species have anal [[scent gland]]s, but these are far better developed in gymnures, which can have a powerful odor. < ref name=EoM > {{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Wroot, Andrew|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/750 750]â€“757|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}} < /ref > 
 
 Erinaceids are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], with the major part of their diet consisting of insects, earthworms, and other small [[invertebrates]]. They also eat seeds and fruit, and occasionally bird's eggs, along with any [[carrion]] they come across. Their teeth are sharp and suited for impaling invertebrate prey. The [[dental formula]] for erinaceids is: upper=2-3.1.4.3; lower=3.1.2-4.3. 
 
 Hedgehogs are [[nocturnal]], but gymnures are less so. Many species live in simple burrows, while others build temporary nests on the surface from leaves and grass, or shelter in hollow logs or similar hiding places. Erinaceids are solitary animals outside the breeding season, and the father plays no role in raising the young. < ref name=EoM/ > 
 
 Female erinaceids give birth after a gestation period of around six to seven weeks. The young are born blind and hairless, although hedgehogs begin to sprout their spines within 36 hours of birth. 
 
 ==Classification==
