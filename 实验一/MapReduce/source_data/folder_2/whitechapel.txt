 '''Whitechapel''' is a district in the [[East End of London]], in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]. 
 
 It is 3.4 miles (5.5 km) east of [[Charing Cross]] and roughly bounded by [[Petticoat Lane]] and [[London Inner Ring Road#Mansell Street|Mansell Street]] to the west, Fashion Street to the north, Cambridge Heath Road and [[Sidney Street]] to the east and [[The Highway]] to the south. 
 
 Because the area is close to the [[London Docklands]] and east of the city, it has been a popular place for [[immigrant]]s and the [[working class]]. The area was the centre of the London [[Jew]]ish community in the 19th and early 20th century. It is where the infamous [[Whitechapel murders|Whitechapel Murders]] by [[Jack the Ripper]] took place in 1888. In the latter half of the 20th century, Tower Hamlets (including Whitechapel) became the largest settlement for the British [[Bangladeshi]] community, particularly on and around [[Whitechapel Road]] and [[Brick Lane]].
