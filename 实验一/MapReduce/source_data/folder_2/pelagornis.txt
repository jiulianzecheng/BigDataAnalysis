 '''''Pelagornis''''' is a [[genus]] of huge [[fossil]] [[birds]]. One [[species]], ''P. sandersi'', is one of the largest bird ever found. < ref > Morelle, Rebecca 2014. Fossil of 'largest flying bird' identified. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-28164063] < /ref >  Its [[wingspan]] was twice that of the largest [[Albatross]]. Its wingspan is estimated as about 6.4 to 7.4 metres. < ref > compare with ''[[Argentavis]]''. < /ref >  The fossil of this particular species is from the [[Oligocene]] stage, about 25 million years ago (mya). 
 
 The pelagornithids are an extinct group of birds known for bony tooth-like beak projections, large size, and highly modified wing bones. There are many questions about their ecology. The bird was capable of highly efficient gliding. That suggests it had a long-range [[Marine biology|marine]] soaring life-style similar to that of living albatross. < ref > Ksepka, Daniel T. 2014. Flight performance of the largest volant bird. ''PNAS USA'' prepub. [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/07/02/1320297111] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712014215/http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/07/02/1320297111 |date=2014-07-12 }} < /ref > 
 
 Several later species have been found, and they are not quite so large. < ref > ''BBC News''. Ancient American bird was glider. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6262740.stm] < /ref >  The whole group died out about three million years ago.
