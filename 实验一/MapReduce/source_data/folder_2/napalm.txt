 '''Napalm''' is a mixture of a gelling agent and a [[Volatiles|volatile]] [[petrochemical]]. It is a [[flammable]] [[liquid]] (liquid that is easy to burn) that has been used in [[war]].  When it is mixed with [[gasoline]], the thickener makes a sticky [[gel]] that is easy to burn, and burns for a long time. A team of [[Harvard]] chemists in U.S. made napalm during [[World War II]]. The team leader was [[Louis Fieser]]. The name ''napalm'' comes from the ingredients that were first used to make it: coprecipitated [[aluminium|aluminum]] salts of [[naphtha|'''na'''phthenic]] and [[palmitic|'''palm'''itic]] acids. < ref name= " GS Napalm " > {{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/napalm.htm|title=Napalm|website=www.globalsecurity.org}} < /ref > 
 
 One of the major problems of first fluids used for lighting fires (such as those used in [[flamethrower]]s) was that they splashed and drained too easily. Flamethrowers that use a gasoline gel can shoot farther and are more useful. Gasoline gel was hard to make because it used natural rubber, which was in high demand and expensive. Napalm was much cheaper. It solved the problems involved with rubber-based incendiaries (things made to cause fire). < ref name= " GS Napalm " / > 
 
 Nowadays, napalm is mostly made of [[benzene]] and [[polystyrene]], and is known as napalm-B. < ref name= " GS Napalm " / > 
 
 Napalm was used in flamethrowers and [[firebomb]]s by the U.S. and [[Allies of World War II|allied forces]]. Napalm is made to burn at a specific rate and stick to materials. This is done by mixing different amounts of napalm and other materials. Another useful (and dangerous) effect, mostly in its use in bombs, was that napalm  takes the [[oxygen]] out of the air and makes large amounts of [[carbon monoxide]] that suffocated people. Napalm bombs were used in the [[Vietnam War]] to clear [[landing zone]]s for helicopters. < ref name= " GS Napalm " / > 
 
 Napalm was a 20th-century invention. However, it is a part of a long history of [[incendiary device]]s in warfare. Historically, it was mostly liquids that were used (see [[Greek fire]]). An flammable liquid fuel weapon which can be held by people, the [[flamethrower]] was created in [[World War I]] by the Germans. Many other types of flamethrowers were soon made by other sides in the conflict. < ref name= " GS Napalm " / >

 On July 17, 1944, napalm bombs were dropped for the first time by American [[P-38]] pilots on a fuel storehouse at [[Coutances]], near [[Saint-Lô|St. Lô]], France. < ref > http://www.gruntonline.com/US_Forces/US_Artillery/arty13d.htm < /ref >  Napalm bombs were first used in the Pacific Theatre during the [[Battle of Tinian]] by [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] pilots. Its use was made difficult by problems with mixing, fusing and the release mechanisms. < ref > {{cite book |last=De Chant |first= John A. |authorlink= |title=Devilbirds |url=https://archive.org/details/devilbirdsstoryo0000john |year=1947 |publisher= Harper  &  Brothers Publishers |location= New York |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/devilbirdsstoryo0000john/page/155 155] }} < /ref >  In World War II, Allied forces [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|bombed cities]] in [[Japan]] with napalm, and used it in bombs and flamethrowers in Germany and the Japanese-held islands. It was used by the [[Greece|Greek]] army against communist [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters during the [[Greek Civil War]], by United Nations forces in [[Korea|Korea,]] by [[Mexico]] in the late 1960s against guerrilla fighters in [[Guerrero (state)|Guerrero]] and by the [[United States]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. 
 
 The most well-known method of using napalm for war is from air-dropped [[incendiary bomb]]s. A lesser-known method is flame throwers. [[Flamethrower]]s use a thinner version of the same fuel to destroy prepared locations of guns, [[Bunker|bunkers]] and [[cave]] hideouts. [[U.S. Marines]] fighting on [[Guadalcanal]] found them very effective against Japanese positions. The Marines used fire as a weapon to cause damage and as a [[psychological]] weapon. People have a natural fear of fire. They found that Japanese soldiers would abandon positions when napalm was used. Prisoners of war confirmed that they were scared of napalm more than any other weapon thrown at them. 
 
 Napalm became one of the more used weapons of the [[Korean War]]. Pilots returning from the war zone often said that they would rather have a couple of gasoline tanks full of napalm to drop than any other weapon, bombs, rockets or guns. The U.S. Air Force and Navy used napalm with great effect against all types of targets to include troops, tanks, buildings and even [[Railroad|rail road]] tunnels. The fear napalm had on the enemy became obvious when North Korean troops began to surrender to aircraft flying overhead. Pilots noted they saw surviving enemy troops waving white flags on following passes after dropping napalm. The pilots radioed to ground troops and the North Koreans were captured. < ref > {{cite book

 Napalm has been used recently in wartime by or against: [[Iran]] (1980–88), [[Israel]] (1967, 1982), [[Nigeria]] (1969), [[Brazil]] (1972), [[Egypt]] (1973), [[Cyprus]] (1964, 1974), [[Argentina]] (1982), [[Iraq]] (1980–88, 1991, 20th March 2003 – 15th December 2011), [[Serbia]] (1994), [[Turkey]] (1963, 1974, 1997), [[Angola]], [[United States]]. 
 
 In some cases, napalm disables and kills its victims very quickly. Those who do survive suffer up to 5th degree burns. These damage parts of the skin which do not have pain receptors. However, victims who suffer 2nd degree burns from splashed napalm will be in a lot of pain. < ref name= " GS Napalm " / > 
 
 [[Philip Jones Griffiths]] described its use in Vietnam: 
 
 {{cquote|NAPALM. The most effective  " anti-personnel "  weapon, it is euphemistically described as  " unfamiliar cooking fluid "  by those [[Apologetics|apologists]] for American military methods. They automatically attribute all napalm cases to domestic accidents caused by the people using gasoline instead of kerosene in their cooking stoves. Kerosene is far too expensive for the peasants, who normally use charcoal for cooking. The only  " cooking fluid "  they know is very  " unfamiliar "  – it is delivered through their roofs by U.S. planes.}}

" Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. Napalm generates temperatures of 800 to 1,200 degrees Celsius. " < ref name= " UConn " > Elizabeth Omara-Otunnu. University of Connecticut Advance.

 Phuc had third-degree burns to half her body and was not expected to live. Thanks to assistance from South Vietnamese photographer [[Nick Ut]], and after surviving a 14-month hospital stay and 17 operations, she became an outspoken [[peace activist]]. 
 
 International law does not prohibit the use of napalm or other incendiaries against military targets, < ref name= " UConn " / >  but use against civilian populations was banned by the [[United Nations]]' [[inhumane weapons convention]] (often referred to as the CCW) in 1981. Protocol III of the CCW restricts the use of incendiary weapons (not only napalm), but a number of states have not accepted all of the protocols of the CCW. According to the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], states are considered a party to the convention, which entered into force as international law in December 1983, if they ratify at least two of the five protocols. The [[United States]], for example, is a party to the CCW but did not sign Protocol III. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.sipri.org/contents/library/AnnexA05.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-04-10 |archive-date=2008-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015011144/http://www.sipri.org/contents/library/AnnexA05.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 Reports by the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' suggested that ''napalm'' has been used in the [[Iraq War]] by US forces. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://fletcher.tufts.edu/multi/texts/BH790.txt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-04-10 |archive-date=2005-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308133629/http://fletcher.tufts.edu/multi/texts/BH790.txt |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] denied this. In August 2003, the [[San Diego Union Tribune]] said that U.S. Marine pilots and their commanders confirmed the use of [[Mark 77 bomb|Mark 77 firebombs]] on [[Iraqi Republican Guards]] during the start of combat. Official denials of the use of 'napalm' were, however, disingenuous, as the Mk 77 bomb that is currently in service at this time, the Mk 77 Mod 5, does not use actual napalm (e.g. napalm-B). The last U.S. bomb to use actual napalm was the Mark 77 Mod 4, the last of which were destroyed in March 2001. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/mk77.htm|title=MK-77 - Dumb Bombs|website=www.globalsecurity.org}} < /ref >  The substance used now is a different incendiary mixture. It is sufficiently analogous in its effects that it is still a controversial incendiary, and can still be referred to colloquially as 'napalm.'

" Unfortunately, there were people there because you could see them in the (cockpit) video. "  (...)  " They were Iraqi soldiers there. It's no great way to die, "  he added. (...)

 These bombs did not actually have napalm in them. The napalm-B (super napalm) used in Vietnam was [[gasoline]] based. The Mk-77 firebombs used in the Gulf were [[kerosene]] based. It is, however, a napalm-like liquid in its effect. < ref name= " GS Napalm " / > 
 
 Recipes how to make napalm-like substances can be found on the Internet. Very often, the recipes say that they will make a thick substance using gasoline, with [[soap]] or polystyrene as a thickening agent. However, inexperienced people following these instructions often handle the substance improperly and cause accidents. In addition, making [[incendiary device]]s is illegal in many countries.

 Napalm usually has gasoline with correct [[thickening agent]]s. The first thickeners were [[soap]]s, aluminum, and magnesium [[palmitate]]s and [[stearate]]s. Depending on how much thickener is added, the resulting [[viscosity]] can range between syrupy liquid and thick rubbery gel. The content of long hydrocarbon chains makes the material highly [[hydrophobic]] (resistant to wetting with water), making it more difficult to extinguish (remove fire). Thickened fuel also bounces better, so it is better for missions in urban places. 
 
 There are two types of napalm: oil-based with aluminium soap thickener, and oil-based with polymeric thickener ( " napalm-B " ). 
 
 The United States military uses three types of thickeners: M1, M2, and M4. 
 * The '''M1 Thickener''' (Mil-t-589a), chemically a mixture of 25% wt. aluminum [[naphthenate]], 25% aluminum [[oleate]], and 50% aluminum [[laurate]], (or, according to other sources, aluminium [[stearate]] soap) is a highly [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] coarse tan-colored powder. As the water content lowers the quality of napalm, thickener from open containers should not be used later. It is not in the US Army inventory any more as it was replaced with M4. 
 * The '''M2 Thickener''' (Mil-t-0903025b) is a whitish powder similar to M1, with added devolatilized [[silica]] and anti-caking agent. 
 * The '''[[M4 Thickener|M4 flame fuel thickening compound]]''' (Mil-t-50009a), hydroxyl aluminum bis(2-ethylhexanoate) with anti-caking agent, is a fine white powder. It is less hygroscopic than M1 and opened containers can be opened and closed and also used within one day. About half the amount of M4 is needed for the same effect as of M1. 
 
 A later type of napalm, napalm-B, also called  " super napalm " , has low-octane gasoline, benzene and polystyrene in it. It was used in the [[Vietnam War]]. Napalm B burns for up to 10 minutes with fewer fireballs. This is different than conventional napalm, which burns for only 15–30 seconds. It also sticks better to surfaces, and can destroy things better. It is not as easy to light. This lowers the number of accidents caused by soldiers smoking. It gives a unique smell when it burns. 
 
 Starting in the early 1990s, various websites including [[The Anarchist Cookbook]] advertised recipes for homemade napalm. These recipes were predominantly equal parts gasoline and [[styrofoam]]. This mixture closely resembles that of napalm-B, but lacks a percentage of benzene. 
 
 Napalm reaches burning temperatures of approximately 1,200 °[[Celsius|C]] (2,200 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]). Other additives can be added, e.g. powdered aluminium or magnesium, or [[white phosphorus (weapon)|white phosphorus]]. 
 
 In the early 1950s, [[Norway]] developed its own napalm, based on fatty acids in [[whale oil]]. The reason for this development was that the American-produced thickening agent performed rather badly in the cold Norwegian climate. The product was known as Northick II. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.norwaves.com/norwaves/Volume5_1997/v5nw43.html |title=Norwaves Volume 5, Number 43, 1997 |access-date=2007-04-10 |archive-date=2006-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114090514/http://www.norwaves.com/norwaves/Volume5_1997/v5nw43.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == In popular culture == 
 Napalm itself became well known by the American public after it was used in the Vietnam war. Since then, it has been mentioned in the media and arts many times. Some of the examples are: 
 * In the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', assault helicopter pilot Colonel Kilgore ([[Robert Duvall]]) famously says  " I love the smell of napalm in the morning... It smells like... victory. " 
 * In the American newspaper comic [[Calvin and Hobbes]], [[Calvin (Calvin and Hobbes)|Calvin's]] favorite comic book [[superhero]] (and a character he wants to become) is Captain Napalm. To add an aspect of [[irony]] (especially when considered with the usage of napalm in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''), the motto for Captain Napalm is  " Defender of the American Way " . 
 * In the film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'', Sgt. Foley ([[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]) leads a quick-step march with a [[military cadence|cadence call]] that has the chorus,  " [[Napalm sticks to kids|And napalm sticks to kids!]] " , a real U.S. Air Force cadence call at the time. 
 * In ''[[Skippy's list]]'', item 58 is '“Napalm sticks to kids” is *not* a motivational phrase.' 
 * In the film ''[[Fight Club]]'', the screenwriters were originally going to have Tyler Durden (played by [[Brad Pitt]]) recite a working recipe for napalm. However, after questions of safety were brought to the attention of the producers, they substituted his lines with a fake recipe claiming it to be equal parts of [[gasoline]] and [[orange juice]] concentrate. Contrary to popular belief, the original recipes in [[Fight Club|the ''Fight Club'' book]] were also modified by its publisher. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/chuck_palahniuk.html|title=Chuck Palahniuk - Author of Fight Club|website=www.dvdtalk.com}} < /ref >  The book's altered recipes claim that, in addition to orange juice, mixing equal parts gasoline and [[diet soda|diet cola]], or thickening gasoline with [[cat litter]], will work. 
 * In the 1973 Japanese [[kaiju]] film ''[[Godzilla vs. Megalon]]'', the enemy [[Megalon]], was shown to be able to spit napalm bombs that explode on contact. 
 * There is a [[heavy metal music|metal]] band called [[Napalm Death]].
