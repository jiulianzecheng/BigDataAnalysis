 '''''Hieracium''''' is the '''hawkweed'''. This [[genus]] of [[sunflower]]s has a huge number of [[species]] {{ndash}} over ten thousand species and [[subspecies]].  
 
 Some experts split it up into two genera: what is here treated as the single genus ''Hieracium'' is treated by some European experts as two genera, ''Hieracium'' and ''Pilosella''. 
 
 Like all members of the family, hawkweeds have tightly packed flowerheads made of many small flowers. They reproduce [[asexual]]ly by seeds which are [[genetically]] identical to those of the mother plant. < ref > Edsall, Marion 2007 [1985]. Roadside Plants and Flowers: a traveler's guide to the Midwest and Great Lakes area. University of Wisconsin Press, p46. ISBN 0-299-09704-8. Dewey 582.0977. A dry roadside dotted with small, 3/4 inch red orange flowers, interspersed with very similar yellow ones, and often the white of daisies, is a good sign that you are in Hawkweed country. < /ref >
