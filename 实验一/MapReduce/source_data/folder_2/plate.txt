[[File:Unglazed plates.jpg|thumb|Plates]]A '''plate''' is a type of [[dish]] where [[food]] can be placed after being [[cook]]ed for [[eat]]ing. Sometimes they are called dishes. They may be made out of [[ceramic]], [[plastic]], [[paper]], or [[styrofoam]]. 
 
 A '''plate''' is also one of the broken pieces of [[lithosphere]] of the [[Earth]].  These plates have irregular [[shape]]s. They lie and float on the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. They move very slowly in different [[direction]]s. Their [[movement]] is driven by the [[convection current]]s in the [[magma]].  A plate can contain both oceanic and continental crusts. Some contain oceanic crust only.
