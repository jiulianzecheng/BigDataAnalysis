 '''Nobility''' was the highest [[social class]] in pre-modern societies. In the [[feudal system]] (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were mostly those who got land from the [[monarch]] and had to provide services to him, mainly [[military]] service. Men of this class were called noblemen. It soon became a hereditary class, sometimes with a right to bear a hereditary title and to have financial and other privileges.  
 
 Today, in most countries, 'noble status' means no legal privileges; an important exception is the [[United Kingdom]], where certain titles (titles of the [[peerage]], until recently guaranteed a seat in the Upper House of Westminster Parliament, that is why it is called [[House of Lords]]), and still means some less important privileges.
