 A '''poster''' is a large piece of printed [[paper]] that has a message, usually with [[picture]] of something. Posters are made to be shown in public on a [[wall]] or other flat surfaces. They were the main form of public advertising before the [[WWW|web]], and they are still used. 
 
 Posters are used for [[advertising]], [[education]], [[propaganda]], and [[design|decoration]]. < ref > Hillier, Bevis 1969. ''Posters''.

London: Thames  &  Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-20118-8}} < /ref >  They may also be copies of famous works of [[art]]. 
 
 == Chromolithography and the poster == 
 Chromolithography (color [[lithography]]) was invented by Engelmann  &  Son, who were granted a [[patent]] in 1837. < ref > Twyman, Michael 1970. ''Lithography 1800–1850''. Oxford University Press. p160 < /ref >  After that, it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development. 
 
 Because of its low production costs, over the 50 years after the American Civil War, millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under $10. [[Louis Prang]], a Bostonian, produced fine-art subjects, such as still lifes, landscapes, and classical subjects. < ref > Gallo, Max 2002. ''The poster in History''. W.W. < /ref >  Nevertheless, it was only after 1847 that the [[Jules Chéret]] posters showed their real potential. < ref name=H > Hutchinson H.F. 1968.

 Image:Cheret, Jules - Carnivale Poster.jpg| The women of Chéret's posters, playful, elegant, and lively were very different from previously depicted prostitutes or puritans.  
   
 Image:Cheret, Jules - Humber Cycles.jpg| Chéret minimized the role of the text. In this poster, all of the relevant information is said in two words.

 == Posters in the first half of the 20th century == 
 Posters were used for war propaganda, to encourage young people to enlist in the army, and to sell government war bonds. From a strictly artistic view, the posters were unimaginative and far from the masterpieces of the late 19th century posters. The posters almost all came with a caption to bang the message home.
