 In [[linguistics]], '''syntax'''{{efn|from [[Ancient Greek]] συν- ''syn-'', “together”, and τάξις ''táxis'', “arrangement”}} is the study of the rules that govern the structure of [[sentence]]s.  
 
 The term ''syntax'' can also be used to refer to these rules themselves, as in “the syntax of a language”. Modern research in syntax attempts to describe [[language]]s in terms of such rules, and, for many practitioners, to find general rules that apply to all languages.
