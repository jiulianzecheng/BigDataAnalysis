 '''Letterkenny''' ({{lang-ga|Leitir Ceanainn}}) is a town in [[County Donegal]] of the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is  on the [[River Swilly]] and has a population of 17,586. 
 
 In 1824, when the first description of Letterkenny as a modern town was written, it was stated that: '' " Within half a mile is the Port of Ballyraine, whither vessels of 100 tons bring iron, salt and colonial produce and whence they export hides and butter " ''. Nothing is left of the port now except the warehouses. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.directorytourism.com/Tourism-By-Region/destination-letterkenny-tourism-l741.html?language=Spanish |title=Only Warehouse Architecture remains |access-date=2011-06-14 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927141716/http://www.directorytourism.com/Tourism-By-Region/destination-letterkenny-tourism-l741.html?language=Spanish |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
