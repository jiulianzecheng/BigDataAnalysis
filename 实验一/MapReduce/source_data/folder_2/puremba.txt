'''Khuman Puremba''' ({{lang-omp|Khuman Pulempa}}) or '''Khuman Purenba''' ({{lang-omp|Khuman Pulenpa}}) is a son of [[Parenkoiba]] ({{lang-omp|Palenkoipa}}) and a grandson of Khuman prince [[Haoramyaima]] ({{lang-omp|Haolamyaima}}), who once fled from the [[Khuman kingdom]] to [[Ancient Moirang]] kingdom. He is a brave warrior of [[Khuman dynasty]] and a minister of [[Ancient Moirang]] kingdom. He is best known for capturing the nine tigers alive from the wild and saving the life of the King of [[Moirang]]. For the king having no daughter, Puremba was offered [[Ngangkha Leima]], one of the King's wives as a reward for his bravery. [[Ngangkha Leima]] was already conceived with the king's child when she came to Puremba's home. So, her first child [[Khamnu]] was, in fact, the blood of the king. And with Puremba, she gave birth to [[Khuman Khamba]]. At the joy of the birth of his son, Puremba stroke the emergency war noticing drum of the kingdom even though there was no invasion of the enemies. For this, he was punished to death. After he died, his wife also died. So, his children were brought up by his friends, on the rotational basis, among which [[Kabui Salang Maiba]] took the children's care the most.
