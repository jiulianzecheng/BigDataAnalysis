 '''Gmail''' is a free [[e-mail]] service that is run by [[Google]]. It can be accessed on the [[World Wide Web|web]], by [[POP3]], or by [[IMAP]]. Some of the competitors to Gmail are [[Yahoo|Yahoo! Mail]], [[Hotmail|Hotmail/Windows Live Mail]], and Inbox.Com. The space given to any Gmail member is increased a small amount every second, and as of July 26, 2012, Google provides each account with about 10272 [[Megabyte|MB]] of space. 
 
 == Google Apps == 
 [[Google Apps]] is a service from Google that was created in February 2006 as Gmail for your domain. It is to allow [[system administrator]]s of a company or organisation to create email accounts for their own domain. 
 
 == Trademark issues == 
 In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), the trademark  " Gmail "  was owned by another company before Gmail by Google was started. Thus, the United Kingdom uses a domain of  " googlemail.com "  for their users, and the [[logo]] has the words of  " Google Mail "  instead of the normal  " Gmail " . 
 
 In September 2009 Google began to change the branding of UK accounts back to Gmail following the resolution of the trademark dispute. < ref name= " Bradshaw21Sep09 " > {{cite web |url= http://blogs.ft.com/techblog/2009/09/the-curious-case-of-the-uks-missing-gmail |title= The curious case of the UK's missing Gmail |accessdate= 14 May 2010 |last= Bradshaw |first= Tim |date= September 2009}} < /ref >
