 '''Demolition''' is a process in which [[building]]s are torn down. Demolition is different from deconstruction, which is carefully taking a building apart to reuse its parts. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/deconstruction-versus-demolition/ |title= Deconstruction versus Demolition |author=Bob Borson |date=4 November 2013 |publisher=Life of an Architect |access-date=Aug 11, 2015}} < /ref >  For small buildings, such as [[house]]s, demolition is often simple. Buildings are often pulled down with [[excavator]]s, [[bulldozer]]s or small [[Crane (machine)|cranes]]. Other specialized equipment may also be used. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.hitachicm.com/global/ourbusiness/products/demolition-equipment/ |title=Demolition Equipment |publisher=Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. |access-date=Aug 11, 2015 |archive-date=August 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819022429/https://www.hitachicm.com/global/ourbusiness/products/demolition-equipment/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Larger buildings may use a [[wrecking ball]] swung by a crane. < ref name=RodriguezAB > {{cite web|url=http://construction.about.com/od/Commercial-Remodeling/a/Demolition-Methods.htm|title=Demolition Methods|author=Juan Rodriguez|publisher=About.com|access-date=Aug 11, 2015|archive-date=May 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512230458/http://construction.about.com/od/Commercial-Remodeling/a/Demolition-Methods.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This works well for [[masonry]] buildings. Sometimes [[building implosion]] is used. < ref name=RodriguezAB/ >  This involves using carefully placed [[Explosive material|explosive charges]]. If done correctly, the building falls in on itself and not on nearby buildings. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 Before a building can be torn down, several things have to happen. < ref name=Express > {{cite web |url= http://expressrecyclingandsanitation.com/2013/03/15/basic-steps-to-demolish-a-house/#sthash.0ArXpqeL.dpbs |title= Basic Steps to Demolish a House |publisher= Express Recycling and Sanitation LLC |access-date=Aug 11, 2015}} < /ref >  A demolition permit has to be obtained from a city, town or county. All [[hazardous waste]] must be removed. This includes [[asbestos]], [[lead]] paint and any [[Flammability|flammable]] materials. < ref name=Express/ >  All [[public utility|utilities]] (water, [[electricity]] and [[natural gas]]) have to be disconnected. < ref name=Express/ >  Many [[municipalities]] have checklists of what to do before a building can be demolished. They also have check[[list]]s of things that must be removed first.
