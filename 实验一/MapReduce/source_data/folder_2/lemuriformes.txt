 '''Lemuriformes'''  are an [[order (biology)|infraorder]] of [[Primates]]. It combines the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]], with the [[galago]]s and [[lorises]] of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. 
 
 The [[lorises]] and [[lemurs]] are a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]]. < ref > Szalay F.S.  &  Delson E. 1980. ''Evolutionary history of the primates''.

 == Evolutionary history == 
 Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. The main problem is a lack of clear transitional fossils. < ref name=Rose > Rose K.D. 2006. ''The beginning of the age of mammals''. Johns Hopkins University Press, p179–181. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8472-6}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Molecular clock]] estimates suggest that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the [[Paleocene]], about 62 & nbsp;mya.  Between 47 and 54 & nbsp;mya, lemurs got to Madagascar by [[Oceanic dispersal|rafting]]. < ref name=Vaughan > Vaughan T; Ryan J.  &  Czaplewski N. 2011. Chapter 12: Primates. In ''Mammalogy''. 5th ed, Jones  &  Bartlett Learning, 169–179. {{ISBN|978-0-7637-6299-5}} < /ref >   In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the [[niche]]s often filled by [[monkeys]] and [[apes]] today. < ref > Cartmill M.  &  Smith F.H. 2011. ''The human lineage''. John Wiley, p89. {{ISBN|978-1-118-21145-8}} < /ref > 
 
 In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, about 40 & nbsp;mya. < ref name=Vaughan/ >  Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals. < ref name=Hartwig/ > 
 
 == Adapiformes == 
 Because the skeletons of [[adapiform]]s share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as  " primitive "  strepsirrhines, < ref name=Rose/ >  lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines.  They are included in Strepsirrhini, < ref name=Vaughan/ >  and are considered basal members of the clade. < ref > Covert H.H. 2002.

Cambridge University Press, p18. {{ISBN|978-0-521-66315-1}} < /ref > 
 
 Although their status as true primates is not questioned, their relationship with other primates in Strepsirrhini is unclear. Sometimes they are put in their own infraorder; sometimes they are sometimes reduced to families in the Lemuriformes. < ref name=Rose/ >
