 A '''varve''' is a pattern in [[sediment]] which is made by [[wikt:annual|annual]] processes (deposits which vary during the year). Varves are amongst the smallest-scale events in [[stratigraphy]]. They form only in fresh or [[brackish water]]. Varves are important in [[palynology]], and can be fossilized as [[rhythmite]]s. 
 
 The classic varve [[archetype]] is a light/dark-coloured couplet deposited in a [[glacial lake]]. The light layer is usually [[silt]] and fine [[sand]] deposited when [[spring]] meltwater brings sediment into the lake.  
 
 During winter, when meltwater and its sediment is reduced and the lake surface freezes, fine [[clay]]-size sediment is deposited forming a dark-coloured layer. 
 
 Varve formation needs the absence of [[bioturbation]] (lake bottom disturbed by animals). Therefore, varves usually form under [[anoxic]] conditions.
