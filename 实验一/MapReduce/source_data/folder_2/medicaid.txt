 Under the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) of 2010, states had the option to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly all low-income people under the age of 65. Eligibility for children was extended to at least 133% of the federal poverty level, and states now have the option to cover adults with income levels at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Dan Wagener|first=|title=Medicaid Rehab Coverage for Drug, Alcohol  &  Substance Abuse Treatment|url=https://americanaddictioncenters.org/insurance-coverage/using-medicaid-to-pay-for-rehab|access-date=2020-11-15|website=American Addiction Centers|language=en}} < /ref >  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded coverage so that more Americans have access to health insuranceâ€”which includes mental health treatment coverage.
