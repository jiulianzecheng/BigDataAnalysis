'''Healing''' is a process that happens in the [[body]]. Through healing, [[cell]]s are able to repair damaged [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]]. 
 There are two different ways healing can happen: 
 * The damaged tissue is replaced with tissue of the same kind. This is called ''regeneration''. 
 * The damaged tissue is replaced with [[scar]] tissue. This is called ''repair'' 
 
 Most healing processes combine both ways of healing.
