 A '''lock''' keeps things closed. It keeps people from opening something, such as a [[door]] or a [[box]]. [[Key]]s open locks. Sometimes an [[electronic]] card or secret numbers will open a lock. The verb '''''to lock''''' means to set the lock so the door or object is closed. A person who works on locks is called a [[locksmithing|locksmith]]. 
 
 == Types of lock mechanisms == 
 A '''key lock''' is a lock that uses a [[key]] (a piece of metal with [[teeth]] like a little [[saw]]) to open it. Someone must put the key in the lock and turn it to open the lock. This lock is used in [[door]]s and locks for boxes. Key locks can be defeated by [[Lock picking|picking]] them. 
 
 A '''combination lock''' is a lock that uses a [[dial]] (a [[knob]] with numbers all around it) to open it. Someone must turn the dial to the right numbers in the right order. This is called the  " combination. "  This lock is used on [[safe (container)|safes]] and locks for [[bicycle]]s. 
 
 An '''electronic lock''' is a special lock that can only be opened with a [[:wikt:message|message]] from a [[computer]]. This message can be stored in a [[computer chip]] on a card (called a  " key card "  or  " [[wikt:security|security]] card " ). Or it can be made by a computer looking at someone's [[fingerprint]] or [[eye]]. 
 
 [[Time lock]]s are used in [[bank]]s. They prevent anyone opening the vault until a preset time. This defeats [[burglary]] attempts when the bank is closed. 
 
 == Types of lock == 
 [[Padlock]]s are probably the most common type of lock. They are opened either with a key or a combination. The best way to break them is to snap the hoop with a long-handled [[bolt cutter]]. 
 
 [[Pin tumbler lock]]s, commonly called '[[Yale lock]]s', are very common for fastening doors. They were indeed invented by Linus Yale Jnr in the 1860s. 
 
 [[Deadbolt]]s are locks which cannot be moved to the open position except by rotating the cylinder. 
 
 [[Spring latch lock]]. The common door [[latch]] which locks when you pull the door closed. It is much less secure than a deadbolt lock, but more convenient. 
 
 == Security == 
 No lock is completely safe, though some are safer than others. Locks can be defeated by brute force or by lock picking. The most common brute force tool is the [[crowbar]], commonly called (UK) a jimmy or jerry or (US) a wrecking bar. 
 
 Picking involve tools such as pin-tumbler [[lock pick]]s, [[skeleton key]]s, [[bump key]]s, [[pick gun]]s etc. Carrying these tools, especially after dark, is an arrestable offence in most countries except if the owner is a registered [[locksmith]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.lockpickguide.com/lockpickvideos.html |title=Lockpickguide.com |access-date=2012-02-20 |archive-date=2012-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218035500/http://www.lockpickguide.com/lockpickvideos.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
