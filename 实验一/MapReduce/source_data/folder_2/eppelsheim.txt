 ==== Deinotherium at the town hall ==== 
 The ''Dinotherium-Museum'' in Eppelsheim holds fossil remains of mammals from deposits about ten million years old from the prehistoric [[Rhine]] near Eppelsheim. These deposits are known as the [[Deinotherium]] Sands, because they often contain teeth and bones from the extinct [[Proboscidea|proboscid]] deinotherium. 
 
 == Paleontological discoveries == 
 Besides the dinotherium fossils, the [[femur]] of a  ''Paidopithex rhenanus'' was found in the area in the 19th century.  This was a now-extinct catarrhine primate. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12448015|title=Taxonomic affinities of the Eppelsheim femur|first1=Meike|last1=Köhler|first2=David M.|last2=Alba|first3=Salvador Moyà|last3=Solà|first4=Laura|last4=MacLatchy|date=1 December 2002|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=119|issue=4|pages=297–304|via=PubMed|doi=10.1002/ajpa.10140|pmid=12448015}} < /ref >
