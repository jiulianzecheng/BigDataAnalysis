The '''Phoronida''', or '''horseshoe worms''', are a small [[phylum]] of [[Ocean|marine]] animals. There are twenty [[species]], in two [[genera]]. They are part of the [[Brachiozoa]], which also includes the [[brachiopod]]s. 
 
 Phoronids are worm-shaped, but with a gut that loops and exits the body near the mouth. That explains the name 'horseshoe worms'. They are found in all oceans and seas (except the polar seas), and all species have wide geographical ranges.  
 
 They occur at depths up to 400 metres, but mainly between 0 to 70 metres. The life span is thought to be about a year. The adults are tube worms, and secrete [[chitin]]ous tubes in which they live. These tubes can be buried in the [[mud]] or sand or rest on the surface of a rocky substrate. If on [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], they may live in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] with their tubes become twisted around each other for support. Some species can dissolve away holes in rocks such as [[limestone]], [[calcareous]] seashells or even [[cement]] [[pier]]s; they then live in these holes which they line with their secreted tubes. 
 
 They feed using a [[lophophore]], a [[cilia]]ted structure that surrounds the mouth. Together with the [[Bryozoa]] and [[Brachiopoda]], the phoronids belong to the lophophorates, sometimes treated as a single phylum.  
 
 == Anatomy == 
 [[File:Phoronida.gif|thumb|right|230px|Structure of a phoronid.]] 
 Though they are normally long, up to 50cm (30 in). Phoronids are normally very thin.  
 
 The digestive tract of Phoronids consists of a short [[oesophagus]] which leads into a spherical [[stomach]] and then into the [[intestine]]s which end in the [[anus]]. Phoronids have a simple [[blood]] system of one descending [[artery]] and ascending [[vein]] linked by a network of fine [[Capillary|capillaries]]. There are also blood vessels into each of the [[tentacle]]s. The blood is colourless but contains corpuscles with a [[haemoglobin]]-like pigment that helps to carry [[oxygen]]. 
 
 The nervous system is mainly composed by the nervous [[ganglion]] between mouth and anus, a ring nerve at the basis of the lophophore, one or two giant [[nerve fibre]]s which issue from the ganglion and extend along the body wall. There are two tubular [[Excretion|excretory organ]]s, which discharge to the exterior via nephridiopores, on the anal [[wiktionary:Papilla|papilla]]. 
 
 ==Reproduction== 
 Phoronids may be [[hermaphrodite]]s or single sexed, and may also reproduce asexually. [[Gamete]]s are released through the nephridia. [[Fertilisation]] is probably internal. Phoronids follow one of two types of reproductive strategy. Some species, such as ''Phoronis ovalis'', lay only a few (12–25) large eggs which have a lot of yolk. These eggs are brooded within the adult's tube, they are released only when they have hatched. The second strategy is to lay a much larger number (up to 500) of smaller eggs. These eggs are released as soon as they are fertilised. They hatch a few days later into what is called an 'actinotrocha' [[larva]]e. The larvae undergo a [[plankton]]ic development for 2–3 weeks, and settle after about 20 days. [[Metamorphosis]] is 'catastrophic', occurring in less than 30 minutes and leading to a slender young phoronid. 
 
 Phoronids can [[Regeneration|regenerate]] the lophophore if it becomes damaged, in fact ''Phoronis ovalis'' voluntarily loses its lophophore in order to lay its eggs. Once the eggs are laid the animal grows a new lophophore. 
 
 == Feeding == 
 Phoronids are suspension-feeders. They move their lophophores into the prevailing water current. Food particles in the water current are trapped in a stream of mucous that travels along the tentacles until it reaches the oral ring. There it is drawn into the mouth and then on into the digestive tract. Direct uptake of [[amino acid]]s through the [[epidermis]] also occurs. 
 
 == Fossils == 
 The fossil record of phoronids is poor. There are borings dating back to the [[Devonian]] which have been attributed to phoronids. ''Iotuba chengjiangensis'', a form known from only three specimens in the Lower [[Cambrian]], has been interpreted as a phoronid because it appears to have had a U-shaped gut and was tentaculated. Phoronids may be related to the common but mysterious tubular fossils known as hederellids. < ref > Taylor P.D. and Wilson M.A. 2008. Morphology and affinities of hederelloid 'bryozoans'. 301–309.
