 '''Heusenstamm''' is a city in the [[Offenbach Rural District]] in the state of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 
 Heusenstamm is in the ''rhein main region'' {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} southeast of [[Frankfurt]]. The whole area of the town is {{convert|19.03|km2|abbr=off}} large and is {{convert|130|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. < ref > [http://www.stadt-heusenstamm.de/ Homepage of the city of Heusenstamm], looked up on 17 January 2010. {{in lang|de}} < /ref >  It is a plain area with no hills. 
 
 About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of [[tertiary]] the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of [[sediment]]s sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor. 
 
 The city consists out of 2 urban districts, the town of Heusenstamm and the former independent village, ''Rembrücken'', which became on 1th of January 1977 part of Heusenstamm. 
 
 The neighbours of Heusenstamm are:  
 * in the north [[Offenbach]],  
 * in the east [[Obertshausen]] and [[Rodgau]],  
 * in the south [[Dietzenbach]] and  
 * in the west [[Dreieich]]. 
 
 Heusenstamm has 18,227 inhabitants (2008). < ref > [http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html Official statistiks of the state of Hesse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173109/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html |date=2016-05-13 }}, looked up on 17th of January 2010, German. < /ref > 
 
 The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany. 
 
 The local people are speaking a regional type ([[dialect]]) of the German [[language]] with a certain tone and special words. It is spoken in the south of Hesse, named ''hessisch''. This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a [[minority]] and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain [[pronunciation]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 In the 13th century the names of Heusenstamm and Rembrücken were written down in documents for the first time. 
 
 Formerly the people in the Heusenstamm area were mostly [[farmer]]s and [[craft]]smen but not [[trade]]smen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the [[industrial revolution]] the rhein main region got lots of factories and developed to a center for [[metal]] working and [[leather]] [[manufacturing]], also chemical processing. Many men got [[work]]men and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.
