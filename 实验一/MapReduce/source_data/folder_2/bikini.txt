 A '''bikini''' is a type of [[swimsuit]] for [[women]]. It consists of two parts; pants and a [[bra]] top, leaving an uncovered area between the two. The bikini is an ancient invention, reinvented after the [[Second World War]]. 
 
 The bikini is perhaps the most popular female [[beach]]wear around the globe.
