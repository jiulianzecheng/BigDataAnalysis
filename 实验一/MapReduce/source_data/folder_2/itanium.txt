 '''Itanium''' ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|t|eɪ|n|i|ə|m}} {{respell|eye|TAY|nee-əm}}) is a type of [[Intel]] [[microprocessor]]s with [[Microprocessor|64-bit]] chip architecture (not related to the by now mainstream 64-bit CPUs made by Intel and others). Itanium processors are sometimes used today for [[server]]s. Itanium processors where originally designed by HP and Intel with Intel making producing them, and several manufacturers of systems used them; nowhere as many systems used as originally hoped for. By now mostly HP still supports systems using these chips. 
 
 Intel officially announced the end of life and product discontinuance of the Itanium CPU family on January 30, 2019. < ref name= " theend " > {{cite web|url=http://qdms.intel.com/dm/i.aspx/F65EEA26-13FB-4580-972B-46B75E0AB322/PCN116733-00.pdf|title=Select Intel Itanium Processors and Intel Scalable Memory Buffer, PCN 116733-00, Product Discontinuance, End of Life|date=January 30, 2019|publisher=Intel}} < /ref >

 === Development: 1989–2000 === 
 In 1989, HP thought [[reduced instruction set computer|Reduced Instruction Set Computing]] (RISC) architectures were stuck at one [[Instructions Per Cycle|instruction per cycle]]. HP researchers tried to create a new type of processor architecture, later called [[Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing]] (EPIC), that allows the processor to use many [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] in each clock cycle. EPIC uses a form of [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) architecture, in which 1 instruction word had many instructions. With EPIC, the [[compiler]] checks which instructions can be used at the same time, so the processor can run the instructions without needing complicated methods to see which instructions to use at the same time. < ref name= " HP_Labs " > {{cite web

 The goal of this idea is to allow better inspection of the code at the time of compile to check for additional opportunities for multiple executions at once, and to simplify processor design and [[Energy saving|save electricity]] by removing the need for runtime scheduling instructions. 
 
 HP thought that it was not good for individual enterprise system companies like HP to make [[proprietary]] processors, so HP worked with Intel in 1994 to create the IA-64 architecture, made with EPIC's ideas. Intel wanted to make a large effort in creating IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting processor would be used by most enterprise systems. HP and Intel had a large design effort to make the first Itanium product, Merced, in 1998. < ref name= " HP_Labs " / > 
 
 During creation, Intel, HP, and other industry analysts thought that IA-64 would be very popular in servers, workstations, and desktops, and one day replace RISC and [[Complex Instruction Set Computing]] (CISC) architectures for multi-purpose applications. < ref name= " anand " > {{cite web

 Itanium competed with low-power systems (primarily 4-CPU and small systems) with servers based on [[x86]] processors, and with high-power such as with [[International Business Machines|IBM's]] [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER]] architecture and [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[SPARC]] architecture. Intel shifted Itanium to working with the high-power business and [[High-performance computing|HPC]] computing, trying to copy x86's successful market (i.e., 1 architecture, many system vendors). The success of the 1st processor version was only with replacing [[PA-RISC]] in HP systems, [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] in Compaq systems and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] in [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] systems, but IBM also made a supercomputer based on this architecture. < ref name= " Thunder " > {{cite web

 The '''Itanium 2''' processor was released in 2002, for enterprise servers and not all of high-power computing. The 1st version of Itanium 2, code-named ''McKinley'', was created by HP and Intel. It fixed many of the problems of the 1st Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by a bad memory subsystem. ''McKinley'' had 221 million [[transistor]]s (25 million of them were for logic), and was 19.5 & nbsp;mm by 21.6 & nbsp;mm (421 & nbsp;mm < sup > 2 < /sup > ) and was created with a 180 & nbsp;nm design process, and a [[CMOS]] process with 6 layers of aluminium. < ref > Naffzinger, Samuel D. et al. (2002).  " The implementation of the Itanium 2 microprocessor " . ''IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits'', vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 1448–1460. < /ref > 
 
 In 2003, [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] released the [[Opteron]], which implemented the first [[x86-64]] architecture (called [[AMD64]] at the time). Opteron was much more successful because it was an easy upgrade from [[x86]]. Intel implemented x86-64 in its [[Xeon]] processors in 2004. < ref name= " cautionary " / > 
 
 Intel released a new Itanium 2 processor, code-named ''Madison'', in 2003. Madison used a 130 & nbsp;nm process and was the foundation of all new Itanium processors until June 2006. 
 
 In March 2005, Intel announced that it was working on a new Itanium processor, code-named ''[[Tukwila (processor)|Tukwila]]'', to be released in 2007. Tukwila would have 4 processor cores and would replace the Itanium bus with a new [[Common System Interface]], which would also be used by a new Xeon processor. < ref name= " CSI " > {{cite web

 === Itanium 9300 (Tukwila): 2010 === 
 {{Main|Tukwila (processor)|}} 
 The '''Itanium 9300''' series processor, code-named ''Tukwila'', was released on February 8, 2010, with greater performance and memory amount. < ref name= " eweek-tukwila " > [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/IT-Infrastructure/New-Intel-Itanium-Offers-Greater-Performance-Memory-Capacity-349863/ New Intel Itanium Offers Greater Performance, Memory Capacity]{{Dead link|date=December 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, By: Jeffrey Burt, 2010-02-08, eWeek < /ref > 
 
 Tukwila uses a 65 & nbsp;nm process, has between two and four cores, up to 24 & nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MB]] CPU cache, [[Hyper-Threading]] technology and new memory controllers. It also has [[ECC memory|double-device data correction]], which helps to fix memory issues. Tukwila also has [[Intel QuickPath Interconnect]] (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus architecture. It has a maximum inner-processor [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of 96 & nbsp;GB/s and a maximum memory bandwidth of 34 & nbsp;GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has built-in memory controllers, which controls the memory using [[QPI interface]]s to communicate with other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used with Intel processors using the ''[[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]]'' architecture, so that Tukwila and Nehalem might be able to use the same chipsets. < ref name= " Kittson " > {{cite web

 Most Itanium systems sold are [[enterprise server]]s and machines for large-scale technical computing, with each system costing about [[United States dollar|US $]]200,000. A typical system uses eight or more Itanium processors. 
 
 === Chipsets === 
 The Itanium bus communicates with the rest of the system. Enterprise server makers differentiate their systems by making their own chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Creation of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them has developed chipsets to support technologies such as [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] or [[PCI Express]]. < ref name= " zdnet_uk " > {{cite web

 Currently, modern chipsets for Itanium supporting such technologies are manufactured by HP, Fujitsu, SGI, NEC, and Hitachi. 
 
 The  " Tukwila "  Itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with the Intel Xeon processor EX (Intel's Xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers). The goal is to streamline system development and reduce costs for server OEMs, many of whom develop both Itanium- and Xeon-based servers. However, in 2013, this goal was pushed back to  " evaluated for future implementation opportunities " . < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/08/intel_kills_itanium_xeon_convergence_and_kittson/|title=Remember that Xeon E7-Itanium convergence?

 === Emulation === 
 [[Emulator|Emulation]] is a technique that allows a computer to execute binary code that was compiled for a different type of computer. Before IBM's acquisition of [[QuickTransit]] in 2009, application binary software for [[IRIX]]/[[MIPS instruction set|MIPS]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]/[[SPARC]] could run via type of emulation called  " dynamic binary translation "  on Linux/Itanium. Similarly, HP implemented a method to execute PA-RISC/HP-UX on the Itanium/HP-UX via emulation, to simplify migration of its PA-RISC customers to the radically different Itanium instruction set. Itanium processors can also run the mainframe environment [[General Comprehensive Operating System|GCOS]] from [[Groupe Bull]] and several [[x86]] operating systems via [[instruction set simulator]]s. 
 
 == Competition == 
 Itanium is aimed at the [[enterprise server]] and [[high-performance computing]] (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include [[Oracle Corporation]]'s [[SPARC]] M7, [[Fujitsu]]'s SPARC64 X+ and [[IBM]]'s [[POWER8]]. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from [[x86-64]] processors including [[Intel]]'s own [[Xeon]] line and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s [[Opteron]] line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors. < ref name= " Gartner 2009-q4 " / > 
 
 In 2005, Itanium systems accounted for about 14% of HPC systems revenue, but the percentage has declined as the industry shifts to x86-64 clusters for this application. < ref > {{cite web

 An Itanium-based computer first appeared on the list of the [[TOP500]] [[supercomputers]] in November 2001. < ref name= " Thunder " / >  The best position ever achieved by an ''Itanium 2'' based system in the list was #2, achieved in June 2004, when [[Thunder (supercomputer)|Thunder]] (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, [[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]] entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), < ref > {{cite web

 == Processors == 
 
 === Released processors === 
 The Itanium processors show a progression in capability. Merced was a proof of concept. McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with the shift to a 130 & nbsp;nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90 & nbsp;nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667 & nbsp;MHz.

 === Future processors === 
 During the HP vs. Oracle support lawsuit, court documents unsealed by Santa Clara County Court judge revealed in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel Corp. around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, the two companies signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium central processing units for HP's machines until 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, HP has to pay for chips it gets from Intel, while Intel launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20120201201109_HP_Paid_Intel_690_Million_to_Keep_Itanium_Alive_Court_Findings.html|title=HP Paid Intel $690 Million to Keep Itanium Alive - Court Findings.|access-date=2015-12-06|archive-date=2016-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054256/http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20120201201109_HP_Paid_Intel_690_Million_to_Keep_Itanium_Alive_Court_Findings.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/02/hp-itanium/|title=HP Paid Intel $690 Million To Keep Itanium On Life Support|first=Robert|last=McMillan|magazine=Wired |date=February 1, 2012|via=www.wired.com}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Kittson ==== 
 ''Kittson'' is planned to follow Poulson in 2015. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/intel-confirms-itanium-chips-will-get-one-last-hurrah-1291517|title=Intel confirms new Itanium chips are on the way|first=Jamie Hinks 2015-04-20T16:44:00 109Z Computing|last=components|website=TechRadar|date=April 20, 2015 }} < /ref >  Kittson, like Poulson, will be manufactured using Intel's 32 & nbsp;nm process. Few other details are known beyond the existence of the codename and the binary and socket compatibility with Poulson and Tukwila, though moving to a common socket with x86 [[Xeon]]  " will be evaluated for future implementation opportunities "  after Kittson. < ref name= " Kittson2 " > {{cite web
