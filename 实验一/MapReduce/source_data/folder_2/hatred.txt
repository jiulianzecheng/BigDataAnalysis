'''Hatred''' is an [[emotion]] of very strong dislike for someone or something. It is a desire to avoid, restrict, remove, or destroy that person or thing. It is often thought the opposite of [[love]]. Hatred can also be a form of projection. 
 
 [[Sigmund Freud]] said that hatred was a selfish feeling that wishes to get rid of whatever is making that person unhappy. < ref > Freud, S. (1915). The instincts and their vicissitudes. < /ref >  The ''Penguin Dictionary of Psychology'' says that hate is a  " deep, enduring (long-lasting), intense [[emotion]] expressing [[wikt:hostility|animosity]], [[anger]], and [[wikt:hostility|hostility]] towards a person, group, or object. " < ref > Reber, A.S.,  &  Reber, E. (2002). ''The Penguin dictionary of psychology''. New York: Penguin Books. < /ref > 
 
 Hatred can often cause the [[hate crime]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] prohibits inciting hatred by the Article 20.
