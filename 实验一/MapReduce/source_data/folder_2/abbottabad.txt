 '''Abbottabad''' is a city in [[Pakistan]]. It is in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and is the capital of [[Abbottabad District]]. It is also known as the  " city of the pines " . < ref name= " bbc1 " > {{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13257330|title=BBC News – Osama Bin Laden's death: How it happened|work=bbc.co.uk|year=2011|quote=Abbottabad|access-date=4 May 2011}} < /ref >  More that 1.4 million people live in the city. One of the most important places for army training in Pakistan, the [[Pakistan Military Academy]],  is in [[Kakul]], near Abbottabad. 
 
 ==Location== 
 Abbottabad is in the Orash valley, between the two parallel mountain ranges of Mount Sarban and Mount [[Shimla]]. In addition to being the district capital, it is also the capital of the [[Hazara Division]] of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. It is linked by road to [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]] and [[Rawalpindi]] to the South, [[Mansehra]] to the North-West and [[Murree]] to the East. 
 
 == History == 
 The city of Abbottabad is named after Major [[James Abbott]] – a British soldier and administrator who founded the city during British rule in 1853. < ref name= " EB1911 " > [[:wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Abbottabad|Abbottabad – Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] < /ref >  British rule in this area lasted from 1849 < ref > After the annexation of Punjab in March 1849, the British were based at [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]] town, until the founding of Abbottabad in January 1853. See ''Hazara District Gazetteer'' Government of the Punjab, Lahore, 1884, p.34 < /ref >  until Pakistan became independent in 1947. During this time, Abbottabad was an important army garrison or base for the [[British Indian Army]].  
 
 ==Culture and language== 
 The people of Abbottabad are mostly from the [[Syed]] (shahs), [[Karlal]], [[Dhund Abbasi]], [[Gurjar]], [[Awan]], [[Tanoli]] and [[Jadoon]] tribes. It is a peaceful area with high literacy and low crime rates. The main language, or dialect, spoken here is [[Hindko]]. In the rural suburbs of the town people practice some agriculture, whereas the town itself offers many commercial and business opportunities of different types. 
 
 ==The main town and cantonment== 
 Although the original old town of Abbottabad has expanded a lot, much of its original 1850s town, civil lines and cantonment still survive from the time of the [[British Raj]]. Some of its old sights are of special historical interest to tourists, including [[St Luke's Church, Abbottabad]] and the [[Old Christian Cemetery Abbottabad]]. The fine [[Lady Garden Park]] is also a popular place. 
 
 ==Osama bin Laden== 
 In May 2011, [[commando]]s from the [[US Navy]] attacked a large house in [[Kakul]] area close to Abbottabad and killed five people. < ref name=bbc1/ >  The [[Al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] had been living in the house, and was one of the people who were killed there. < ref name=bbc1/ >
