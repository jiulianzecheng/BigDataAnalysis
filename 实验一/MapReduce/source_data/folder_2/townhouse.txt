Modern townhouses are those with a small footprint on several floors. The buildings are exclusively occupied by rich people in [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Detroit]]. In other cities or towns townhouses can be occupied regardless of income. It is a type of terraced housing. A contemporary townhouse is usually one that has a tiny footprint that spans several floors.
