 '''Baryons''' are [[composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s made of an odd number of [[valence quark]]s (at least three [[quarks]]). < ref name= " Gell-Mann 1964 " > {{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-9163(64)92001-3 |bibcode=1964PhL.....8..214G |title=A schematic model of baryons and mesons |journal=Physics Letters |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=214–215 |last1=Gell-Mann |first1=M. |year=1964 }} < /ref >  The most familiar baryons are the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] which make up most of the visible matter in the [[universe]]. [[Electrons]] (the other major component of the atom) are [[lepton]]s. 
 
 Since all quarks have a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of 1/2, all baryons have a spin of 1/2 or 3/2 (the spins can cancel out). 1/2 spin baryons have the lowest energy state. 3/2 spin baryons are extremely [[unstable]], and only live for 10 < sup > -23 < /sup >  seconds. After that, they jump down to a lower energy state by releasing [[photons]] containing [[Kinetic energy|energy]]. These 3/2 spin baryons are known as higher energy [[Resonance (particle physics)|resonances]]. 
 
 All [[particles]] with 1/2 spin (or 3/2 spin) are called [[fermion]]s, and obey [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]]. This means that no two fermions can be in the same point in space at the same time. This is not true for the other type of subatomic particle, called a [[boson]]. More than one boson—like a photon—can exist in the same point in space at the same time.  
 
 Baryons are one of two types of [[hadron]]s, which are particles made of quarks. The other type of hadron is called a [[meson]]. 
 
 The name '''baryon''' comes from Greek  " barys, "  meaning heavy.
