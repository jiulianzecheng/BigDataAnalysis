 '''Sauropoda''' are an [[Order (biology)|infraorder]] of [[saurischia]]n ( " lizard-hipped " ) [[dinosaur]]s. They had very long necks, long tails, small heads (in comparison to the rest of their body), and thick, pillar-like legs and peg-like teeth. 
 
 They are notable for the enormous size of some species. The group includes the largest animals ever to have lived on land. Well-known [[genera]] include ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' and ''[[Brontosaurus]]''.  
 
 Sauropods first appeared in the [[Upper Triassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]]. Their probable ancestral group was the [[Prosauropoda]]. 
 
 By the [[Upper Jurassic]] (150 million years ago), sauropods had become widespread (especially the [[diplodocid]]s and [[brachiosaur]]ids).  
 
 By the [[Upper Cretaceous]], the diplodocids and brachiosaurs been replaced by the [[titanosaur]]s, which had a near-global distribution. They were larger relatives of the brachiosaurs. As with all other non-avian dinosaurs, the titanosaurs died out in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. [[Fossil]]ised remains of sauropods have been found on every continent, including [[Antarctica]].  
 
 The name Sauropoda was coined by [[O.C. Marsh]] in 1878. < ref name= " Marsh1878 " > {{cite journal | last1 = Marsh | first1 = O.C. | year = 1878 | title = Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs, Part I | url = | journal = American Journal of Science and Arts | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 411–416 }} < /ref >  Sauropods are one of the most recognizable groups of dinosaurs, and have become a fixture in popular culture due to their large sizes. Complete sauropod fossil finds are rare. Many species, especially the largest, are known only from isolated and disarticulated bones. Many near-complete specimens lack heads, tail tips and limbs. 
 
 == Life style== 
 === Sauropods and water === 
 Most studies in the 19th and early 20th centuries suggested that sauropods were too large to have supported their weight on land, and therefore that they must have been mainly [[aquatic]]. Most life restorations of sauropods in art through the first three quarters of the 20th century depicted them fully or partially immersed in water. < ref name=henderson2004 > {{cite journal | last1 = Henderson | first1 = D.M. | year = 2004 | title = Tipsy punters: sauropod dinosaur pneumaticity, buoyancy and aquatic habits | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 271 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = S180–S183 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2003.0136 | pmid=15252977 | pmc=1810024}} < /ref >   
 
 This early notion was doubted by Kermack (1951). He showed that, if the animal were submerged in several metres of water, the pressure would be enough to fatally collapse the lungs and airway. < ref name=kermack1951 > {{cite journal | last1 = Kermack | first1 = K.A. | year = 1951 | title = A note on the habits of sauropods | journal = Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. | volume = 4 | issue = 44| pages = 830–832 | doi = 10.1080/00222935108654213 }} < /ref >  However, this and other early studies of sauropod [[ecology]] had a flaw. They ignored evidence that the bodies of sauropods had many [[air sacs]]. In 1878, paleontologist E.D. Cope had even referred to these structures as  " floats " . 
 
 Beginning in the 1970s, the effects of sauropod air sacs on their  lifestyle began to be explored. Evidence from [[sedimentology]] and [[biotechnology]] showed that sauropods were primarily terrestrial animals. In 2004 D.M. Henderson noted that, with their extensive system of air sacs, sauropods could not submerge their bodies completely below the surface of the water. in other words, they would float. So they would not have been in danger of lung collapse due to water pressure when swimming. < ref name=henderson2004/ > 
 
 Evidence for swimming in sauropods comes from fossil trackways that have occasionally been found to preserve only the forefeet (manus) impressions. Henderson showed that such trackways can be explained by sauropods with long forelimbs floating in shallow water, deep enough to keep the shorter hind legs free of the bottom, and using the front limbs to [[Punt (boat)|punt]] forward. < ref name=henderson2004/ >  However, floating sauropods would have been very unstable and poorly adapted for long periods in the water. < ref name=henderson2004/ > 
 
 There definitely is evidence that they preferred wet and coastal habitats. Sauropod footprints are commonly found following coastlines or crossing floodplains. Sauropod fossils are often found in wet environments or mixed with fossils of sea animals. < ref name=henderson2004/ >  A good example of this is be the massive [[Jurassic]] sauropod trackways in [[lagoon]] deposits on [[Scotland]]'s [[Skye|Isle of Skye]]. < ref > {{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-12/02/sauropods-isle-of-skye-dinosaur-discovery|title=Giant wading sauropod discovery made on Isle of Skye (Wired UK)|magazine=Wired UK|access-date=2016-03-22|date=2015-12-02}} < /ref > 
 
 === Group behaviour === 
 With much evidence, sauropods lived in groups, often large groups. They lived as a group, laid their eggs in the same places year after year, and were followed by bipedal theropods who preyed on them. Their breeding grounds had many thousands of eggs, and were laid at a particular time of the year. The cycle was repeated year after year. This suggests a [[season]]ality in their behaviour, and also that their group behaviour was part of their [[defence against predators]] ( " safety in numbers " ). The evidence for all this is now overwhelming. < ref > Chappe Luis  &  Dingus Lowell 2001. ''The lost dinosaurs: the astonishing discovery of the world's largest prehistoric nesting ground''. TimeWarner Books, {{ISBN|0 349 11351 3}}. < /ref > 
 
 Evidence shows that some other groups of herbivores also had group behaviour, moved from place to place, and laid their eggs in the same or similar places each year. < ref > Dodson P; Forster C.A;  &  Sampson S.D. 2004. Ceratopsidae. In: Dodson P; Weishampel D.B.  &  Osmolska H. (eds). ''The Dinosauria'' (2nd ed). Berkeley: University of California Press, p494-513. < /ref > < ref >  Dodson, Peter 1996. ''The horned dinosaurs''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey. pp. 49, 63. {{ISBN|978-0-691-02882-8}} < /ref >  This group behaviour of dinosaurs is also a feature in most birds today. 
 
 == Sauropod necks == 
 There is a long-running debate about sauropod necks. How flexible were they, how high or low was the neck in life: these are some of the issues. Many displays in museums are faulty. A review of the issues is available in free text. < ref name=Steve > Stevens, Kent A. 2013. The articulation of sauropod necks: methodology and mythology. PLos ONE DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078572. [http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078572] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905232715/http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078572 |date=2014-09-05 }} < /ref > 
 : " For instance, none were shaped like swan necks, and there is no support for the persistent suggestion they held their heads high habitually " . < ref name=Steve/ > 
 
 Here's another view:  " Sauropods held their necks erect " . < ref > Taylor, Mike 2011. Sauropods held their necks erect. [http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/neck-posture/#gsc.tab=0] < /ref >
