 {{Quote|I think that drag queens are still the [[eunuch]] clown that’s safe to laugh at. It’s definitively not shocking anymore. So I don't know if America’s really embraced it. The early 90s was when [[RuPaul]] and it was the first time any drag queen had mainstream exposure. I don’t really see a drag queen breaking out like that [again].”|Heklina on [[Feast of Fools (podcast)|Feast of Fools]] < ref > [http://www.feastoffools.net/archives/2006/10/fof_419_-_trick.php  " FOF #419 - Tricks, Treats and Trannies - 10.31.06 " ], ''Feast of Fools'', October 31, 2006.
