 '''''Megalania''''' (''Varanus prisca'') was a giant [[monitor lizard]] that lived in southern [[Australia]]. It was part of a species of [[Australian megafauna|megafauna]] that lived during the [[Pleistocene]], and appears to have disappeared around 40,000 years ago. The first [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] settlers of Australia may have encountered living ''Megalania''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/3046.shtml|title=Megalania, giant ripper lizard|work=BBC Science  &  Nature|accessdate=20 May 2013|archive-date=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220081336/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/3046.shtml|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Megalania'' is the [[Terrestrial animal|land-based]] [[lizard]] known to have existed. Judging from its size, ''Megalania'' would have fed mostly upon medium- to large-sized animals, including any of the giant marsupials like ''[[Diprotodon]]'' .

 Ralph Molnar in 2004 determined a range of possible sizes for ''Megalania''. He did this by scaling up from dorsal vertebrae, after he determined a relationship between dorsal vertebrae length and total body length. If it had a long thin tail like the [[Lace monitor]] (''Varanus varius''), then it would have reached a length of {{convert|7.9|m|ft}}. If its tail-to-body proportions were more similar to that of the [[Komodo dragon]], then a length of around {{convert|7|m|ft}} is more likely. Using 7 & nbsp;m as the maximum length, Molnar estimated the average weight of the lizard at {{convert|320|kg|lb}}, and {{convert|1940|kg|lb}} as the maximum. < ref name= " Molnar, 2004 " > {{cite book|author=R.

 This is twice the length of their closest living relative, the [[Komodo dragon]] of eastern [[Indonesia]]. < ref name= " Pianka " > {{citation|author=R. E.
