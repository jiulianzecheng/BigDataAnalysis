 ==Example== 
 *Foreshadowing is used in the works of [[John Steinbeck]]. In ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', '''Lennie''' [[accident]]ally kills a mouse, a puppy dog and finally '''Curley's Wife'''. This foreshadows his own death. When '''Carlson''' kills Candy's Dog, '''Candy''' told George,  " I ought to of shot that dog myself "  making George later chose to kill Lennie himself to save him from dying by the hands of a stranger. Doing it the way that Carlson did it was for the best because,  " He won't even feel it. "   < ref > John Steinbeck, ''Of Mice and Men'', p 61, {{ISBN|9783125785021}} < /ref >
