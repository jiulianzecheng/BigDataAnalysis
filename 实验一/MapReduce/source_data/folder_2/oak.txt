 The '''oak tree''' is a [[tree]] or [[shrub]] in the [[genus]] '''''Quercus'''''. There are about 500 living [[species]]. They are divided into [[subgenus|subgenera]]. The common name  " oak "  may also appear in the names of species in related genera, such as ''[[Lithocarpus]]''. < ref > Hogan, C. Michael 2012. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Oak ''Oak'']. ed. Arthur Dawson. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC < /ref > 
 
 Oaks have [[spiral]]ly arranged [[leaf|leaves]], with rounded edges in many species; some have leaves with jagged edges or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species do not drop dead leaves until the next Spring. In [[spring (season)|Spring]], a single oak tree produces both male flowers (as [[catkin]]s) and small female flowers. < ref > Conrad, Jim. 2011. [http://www.backyardnature.net/fl_bloak.htm  " Oak flowers " ]. backyardnature.com. < /ref >  The [[fruit]] is a [[nut (fruit)|nut]] called an [[acorn]], carried in a cup-like structure. Each acorn has one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6â€“18 months to mature, depending on species. The so-called  " live oaks "  are [[evergreen]]. They are not a [[taxonomy|taxonomic group]], just a [[life style]] which occurs in the genus. 
 
 The oak is a kind of [[hardwood]] [[forest]] tree. They are well known as a [[climax vegetation]] in the [[temperate zone]] of the [[northern hemisphere]]. That means, left untouched by humans, it would be the dominant tree. Much of England was covered by oak forests before modern [[farming]] took over the land. The last extensive oak [[woodland]]s were cut down to build ships for the [[Royal Navy]] in the 18th century. 
 
 Some kinds of oak [[wood]] are very hard. That is why people in past centuries cut them down to make ships, [[furniture]] and other things. The wood is now scarce and expensive and only used to make a few things anymore. Much cheaper are [[softwood]]s like [[pine]]. 
 
 Oak trees grow slowly and can live up to 1000 years. 
 
 == Associated animals == 
 A mature oak tree stands about 100 feet tall (~30 metres). It is a home for more animals than any other European tree. < ref name=Dickie > Attenborough, David 1995. ''The private life of plants''. London: BBC Books, 152{{ndash}}158. {{ISBN|0-563-37023-8}} < /ref >  30 species of birds, 45 different [[Hemiptera|bugs]] and over 200 species of [[moth]] have been found on oaks. [[Beetles]] burrow under the bark, and some drill holes into the wood. The leaves are eaten by many [[caterpillars]]. Many leaves carry strange little bumps on the underside. These are insect [[gall]]s, caused by many little animals. [[Midge]]s, moths, [[worms]] and tiny [[wasps]] lay their eggs in leaves or leaf [[wikt:bud|buds]]. The leaf reacts by forming a growth around the eggs. Inside the gall, larvae develop. The leaf falls, but the larvae may come out only the next [[spring]]. Small galls only have one larva, but larger galls may contain as many as 30 larvae. < ref name=Dickie / > 
 
 == Acorns == 
 {{Main|Acorn}} 
 
 Oak trees produce acorns once a year which ripen in [[autumn]]. Oak trees may start producing acorns when they are about 20 years old. A mature oak may produce 90,000 acorns a year; this is several millions in its lifetime. < ref name=Dickie / >
