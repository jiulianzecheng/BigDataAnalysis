'''Agnivanshi''' is a person who belongs to the Fire Dynasty of the [[Rajput|Rajputs]]. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 According to Bhavishya Purana, When Parshurama destroyed all the [[Kshatriya|Kshatriyas]] in the land, the [[Brahmin]] priests, headed by Sage Vasishtha, kindled a sacrificial fire at Mount Abu and prayed that they be granted protection by being given some warriors. In answer to their prayer, four heroes came out of the sacrificial fire-pit and these were the ancestors of the chief Rajput Clans - the [[Parmar|Parmaras]], the [[Pratihar|Pratiharas]], the [[Chauhan|Chauhanas]] and the [[Solanki|Chalukyas]]. 
 
 The Four Agnivanshi clans are : 
 * [[Parmar]] 
 * [[Pratihar]] 
 * [[Chauhan]] 
 * [[Virk]] 
 * [[Bundela]] 
 * [[Baghela]] 
 * [[Dogra]] 
 * [[Solanki]] or the [[Solanki|Chalukyas]]
