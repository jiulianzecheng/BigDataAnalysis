'''Yoshi''' is a [[fiction]]al [[dinosaur]] who appears in the ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'' series of [[video game]]s made by [[Nintendo]]. The character was created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]].  
 
 Yoshi's best-known ability is his ability to eat enemies. He has a long [[frog]]-like [[tongue]] which he uses to eat enemies and items. In some games, after Yoshi eats enemies, they can be turned into [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, which can be thrown. One of Yoshi's companions is [[Mario]] who helps Yoshi throughout dangerous situations. Most of the time, Mario can ride Yoshi.  
 
 Yoshi also can [[jump]] very high, and can also [[float]] in the air a little bit by [[kick]]ing his legs. He can also ground pound enemies by quickly jumping on them. 
 
 Yoshis are usually [[green]], but can come in many other [[color]]s. These other colors include [[green]], [[red]], [[light blue]], [[blue]], [[purple]], [[pink]], [[yellow]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[brown]], [[black]], and [[white]]. Blue Yoshi is especially in Super Mario World. In Super Mario 64 DS, Rec Room there's a light blue color in one of Yoshi's minigames Tox Box. In Vs Mode multiplayer, it has a dark blue color and the third player can play him. 
 
 
 
 In a few games like ''[[Super Mario World]]'' Yoshi gains powers, like flying, shooting fireballs when spat out, ground pounding, or all three by holding certain colored [[koopa troopa]] shells in it's mouth.
