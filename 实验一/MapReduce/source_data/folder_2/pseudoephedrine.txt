[[File:Pseudoephedrine.png|thumb|Structure of the pseudoephedrine molecule]] 
 '''Pseudoephedrine''' (commonly abbreviated as PSE) is a [[decongestant]]. The salts '''pseudoephedrine hydrochloride''' and '''pseudoephedrine sulfate''' are found in many [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] drugs either as single-ingredient preparations, or more commonly in combination with [[antihistamine]]s, [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and/or [[ibuprofen]]. Sudafed is a [[trademark]] for a common brand which contains pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, though Sudafed PE does not. Drugs containing pseudoephedrine are commonly used as a treatment for [[Rhinitis]] (an [[inflammation]] of the [[Mucous membrane|mucous mebranes]] in the [[nose]]) 
 
 Unlike [[antihistamine]]s, which modify the systemic [[histamine]]-mediated [[allergy|allergic]] response, pseudoephedrine only relieves [[nasal congestion]] commonly associated with [[common cold|colds]] or [[allergy|allergies]]. 
 
 The advantage of oral pseudoephedrine over topical nasal preparations, such as [[oxymetazoline]], is that it does not cause rebound congestion ([[rhinitis medicamentosa]]); however, it is more likely to cause adverse effects, including [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. 
 
 Some countries started to replace pseudoephedrine by other drugs, such as [[phenylephrine]]. The reason for this is that pseudoephedrine can be used to make [[methamphetamine]], which is an [[illegal drugs|illegal drug]].
