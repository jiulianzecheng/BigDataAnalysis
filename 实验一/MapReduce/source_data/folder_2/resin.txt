 '''Resin''' is a mixture of [[organic compound]] < nowiki/ > s [[secretion|secreted]] by many [[plant]]s, especially [[Conifer|coniferous trees]]. 
 
 Plants [[evolved]] many complex chemicals as  [[defence against herbivory|defences against herbivores]]. That may be the origin of these resins, which are certainly not good to eat. Plants secrete resins for their protective benefits in response to injury.  
 
 The resin protects the plant from insects and pathogens. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/ethnobotany/resins.shtml|title=Resins|website=www.fs.fed.us}} < /ref >  Resins confound a wide range of herbivores, insects, and pathogens. The volatile [[phenol|phenolic compounds]] may attract benefactors, that is, [[parasitoid]]s or predators of the herbivores which attack the plant. < ref > Langenheim, Jean 2003. ''Plant resins: chemistry, evolution, ecology, and ethnobotany''. Timber Press, Portland OR. < /ref > 
 
 Humans also value resins for their many uses. They are used in [[varnish]]es, [[adhesive]]s, as raw materials for [[organic synthesis]], or for [[incense]] and [[perfume]]. [[Fossil]]ized resins are the source of [[amber]]. The term is also used for synthetic substances with similar properties. 
 
 Resins contain chemicals composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur.  Synthetic resins are used in laminates, adhesives, flooring, linings, etc. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Resin Bonded Stone|url=https://resinbondedstone.uk/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-01|website=Resin Bonded Stone|language=en-GB}} < /ref >   
 
 == Rosin == 
 '''Rosin''', (also called 'colophony' or 'Greek pitch') is a solid form of resin. It is got from [[pine]]s and some other [[plant]]s, mostly [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. Heating fresh liquid resin vaporizes light [[volatiles]] like [[terpene]]s.  
 
 Rosin is semi-transparent and yellow to black in colour. < ref > {{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a23_073 |chapter=Resins, natural |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2000 |last1=Fiebach |first1=Klemens |last2=Grimm |first2=Dieter |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2}} < /ref >  The term  " colophony "  comes from ''colophonia resina'' or  " resin from the pine trees of Colophon " , an ancient [[Ionia|Ionic]] city. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Rosin has hundreds of uses, of which only a few can be mentioned here. These uses fall into  groups, such as: 
 #Resisting slippages (increasing [[friction]]): used on stringed instruments, dancers' shoes, in gymnastics, in rock climbing, and on hands of various types of games players. 
 #In manufacturing [[soap]], [[ink]]s, some [[paint]]s, [[paper]], [[varnish]], [[glue]], [[soldering]] fluxes, and [[sealing wax]]. 
 #Pharmaceutical products: tablet film and enteric coating, microcapsules and nanoparticles. 
 #[[Copal]] and [[amber]] are natural rosins: the lighter components of tree resin evaporated and left a hardened rosin. 
 
 ==The exit of the resin from the tree== 
 In each type of wood, the resin comes out in a different way. There are trees in which the resin comes from the  " trunk "  and there are types of trees in which the resin comes out of the  " tree branches " . 
 
 == Resin Harvesting == 
 Some countries in the world also have wood resin [[harvesting]]: 
 
 *In  " [[Greece]] "  there is the picking of a wooden resin  " [[Mastic (plant resin)]] "  with a  " [[slitting]] " . 
 *In  " [[Sudan]] "  there is the picking of of  " [[Acacia]] wood resin "  in the form of resin removal from the tree. 
 *In  " [[Oman]] "  there is the picking of the  " [[Frankincense]] resin "  (the resin also the same name) in the form of peeling the tree trunk. 
 
 ==The Agricultural Research== 
 There is still no extensive agricultural research regarding the tree resins and also, the exact benefit of the resin production by the tree is currently unknown, but some possible hypotheses have been proposed such as plugging holes ([[scab (medicine)|scab]] of wounds), protection against [[insects]] that want to penetrate the tree, and preventing the growth of [[fungi]] [[parasites|parasites]].
