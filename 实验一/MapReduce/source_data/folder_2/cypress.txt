 '''Cypress''' is a name used for many [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s in the [[conifer]] [[Family (biology)|family]] Cupressaceae (cypress family).  
 
 The name comes from the [[genus]] ''[[Cupressus sempervirens|Cupressus]]'' which survives today as a [[conifer]] tree. About 30 cypress species survive. 
 
 Many cypress trees have needle-like, [[evergreen]] foliage and acorn-like seed cones. 
 
 Their earlier relatives were very common in the forests of the [[Jurassic period]].
