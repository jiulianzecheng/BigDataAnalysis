'''Pricing''' is the creation of a [[price]]. In a market [[economy]] the price is made by [[supply]] and [[demand]]. The suppliers would like to get the price as high as possible and the consumers would like to pay as few as possible. Prices will be built if consumers and salesmen make an agreement of the exchange of [[goods]].
