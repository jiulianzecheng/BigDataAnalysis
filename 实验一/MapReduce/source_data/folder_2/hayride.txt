 A '''hayride,''' which can also be called a hayrack ride, is an [[United States|American]] activity where people go on a ride in an open [[truck]], or wagon pulled by a [[tractor]]. Inside of the ride there is [[hay]] or [[straw]] for the people to sit on. Hayrides in the past were a way to celebrate the [[Autumn]] harvest. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/nyregion/hayride-celebrates-city-harvest.html|title=Hayride Celebrates City Harvest|last=Jr|first=Michael Jensen|date=1986-08-17|newspaper=The New York Times|ISSN=0362-4331|access-date=11 November 2016}} < /ref >  Hayrides today are usually started to give farms or companies a way to make more money during the fall.

 == Haunted Hayrides == 
 Hayrides on [[Halloween]] are called 'haunted hayrides'. During the fall, a hayride might let people stop near some [[Pumpkin|pumpkins]] and pick one. These hayrides can put on a show with special effects and actors dressing up as ghosts, monsters, and other spooky creatures. Haunted hayrides attract people who like to get scared, and make money for farms during the Halloween season. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 == Accidents == 
 Even though hayrides are supposed to be a way for people to have fun, they can also be dangerous. Some hayrides have flipped over or gone off-road, hurting or killing people. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Injuries-Reported-Suburban-Hayride-Rollover-Bengtson-280564922.html|title=3 Injured When Hayride Tips at Pumpkin Farm|newspaper=NBC Chicago|access-date=11 November 2016}} < /ref >  Other kinds of accidents happen when hayrides crash into cars or trucks on the road.
