 '''Binalong''' is a small town in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is 37 [[kilometre|km]] north-west of [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]].  
 ==History== 
 The [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal people]] who lived in the area were part of the [[Ngunnawal people|Ngunnawal]] people.  The first [[Europe]]n to visit the area was [[Hamilton Hume]] in 1821. The name of the town is believed to come from either an Aboriginal word meaning 'towards a high place' or from '[[Bennelong]]', the name of a famous Aborigine. 
 
 Binalong was outside the legal limits of European settlement in New South Wales. However farmers settled in the area before the law changed to allow settlement in 1839.  From 1847 there was a [[police]] [[camp]] at Binalong and a [[court]]. The old Cobb and Co [[hotel|inn]] was built at that time as a staging post for [[Cobb and Co]] [[cart|coaches]]. 
 
 The town was officially listed in 1850. It was an important stop on the way for people going to look for [[gold]] at [[Lambing Flat]]. The school was started in 1861.  Gold also meant that there were [[bushranger]]s in the area.  The grave of [[John Gilbert (bushranger)|John Gilbert]] is near the town in the field where the police kept their [[horse]]s.  He was a member of [[Frank Gardiner]]'s gang  and later [[Ben Hall]]'s gang. He was shot dead by police in 1865.   
 
 ==Railway== 
 The first [[railway station]] opened in 1875. The [[railway]] arrived in 1876.  The current building was put up when the railway line was moved in 1916. < ref > {{cite web | title = Binalong railway station| url = http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Binalong & line=NSW:main_south:0| publisher= www.nswrail.net | accessdate = 2008-04-08 }} < /ref >  The station and the signal box are now closed. 
 
 ==Banjo Paterson== 
 The family of the [[poet]] [[Banjo Paterson]] moved to the Binalong area in 1869 when he was five years old.  He went to the primary school in Binalong but later went to [[Sydney Grammar School|boarding school in Sydney]]. He only came home in the [[holiday]]s.  Binalong features in a number of his poems, for example, [http://www.uq.edu.au/~mlwham/banjo/old_pardon.html ''Pardon, the son of Reprieve''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122125719/http://www.uq.edu.au/~mlwham/banjo/old_pardon.html |date=2008-11-22 }}.  Paterson's father is buried in the local [[cemetery]].
