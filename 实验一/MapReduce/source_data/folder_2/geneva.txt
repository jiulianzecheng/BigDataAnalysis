 == History == 
 
 [[File:City of Geneva.jpg|thumb|200px|Views of Geneva]] 
 ''Geneva'' was first written about as a border town, set up to protect the [[Roman Empire]] against the [[Helvetii]]. The Romans took the city in 120 B.C. In A.D. 443 it was taken by [[Burgundy]], and with the latter fell to the Franks in 534. In 888 the town was part of the new Kingdom of Burgundy, and with it was taken over in 1033 by the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Emperor]]. 
   
 From 1154 the bishops of Geneva had the status of [[prince of the Holy Roman Empire]], but the counts of Geneva and later the counts of Savoy were  " guardians " , always ready to take over from the bishops. In 1290 the counts of Savoy got the right to appoint a deputy ruler (vice-dominus) of the diocese, the title of Vidame of Geneva was granted to the family of count [[François de Candie]] of [[Chambéry]]-Le-Vieux a Chatellaine of the Savoy. The ''vidominus'' or [[Roman Curia|Curia]] Viscount of Geneva, had legal and financial powers over the town, under the control of the Bishop and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. 
 
 In 1387 Bishop Adhémar Fabry granted the town its great charter, the basis of its communal self-government, which every bishop on his accession was expected to confirm. The last Count of Geneva died in 1394, and the House of Savoy took over their land. In 1416 the counts became dukes, and kept trying to bring the city of Geneva under their control, often by making members of their own family to Bishops of Geneva. The city protected itself by joining the [[Swiss Federation]] (''Eidgenossenschaft''), uniting itself in 1426 with Berne and Fribourg. 
   
 In the [[Protestant Reformation]] [[Bern (city)|Bern]] favoured the new Protestant teaching and demanded liberty of preaching for the Reformers [[Guillaume Farel]] and [[Antoine Froment]], but Catholic [[Fribourg (city)|Fribourg]] renounced in its union with Geneva in 1511. Later the Protestant leader [[John Calvin]] was based in Geneva from 1536 to his death in 1564. 
 
 At the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814-15) the territory of Geneva was enlarged to cover 15 [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoyard]] and 6 French [[parish]]es, with more than 16,000 Catholics; at the same time it became a part of the [[Swiss Confederation]]. The treaty said that Catholic religion was to be protected, and that no changes were to be made without agreement with the [[Holy See]]. Later, [[Pope]] [[Pius VII]] made the cities of Geneva and [[Lausanne]] a new diocese of and part of Geneva diocese that was in France part of the French diocese of [[Annecy]]. 
 
 The Protestant and [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] churches got money from the city taxes, but the Roman Catholics did not. On 30 June 1907, most of the Catholics of Geneva voted for the separation of Church and State. 
 
 == Geography == 
 [[File:Ginebra-Suiza-NieveDeEnero-02.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[old town]] of Geneva in winter]] 
 Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of [[Lake Geneva]], where the lake meets the [[Rhône River]]. It is surrounded by two mountain chains, the [[Alps]] and the [[Jura mountains|Jura]]. 
 
 The city of Geneva has an area of {{convert|15.86|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The area of the [[Canton of Geneva]] is {{convert|282|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on|lk=on}}. 
 
 The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 m.  This is the altitude of the largest of the [[Pierres du Niton]], two large rocks in the lake that are used as a [[reference point]] for surveying in Switzerland. < ref > [[Swisstopo]], [http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/basics/geo/faq/horizon Height reference for Switzerland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211213/http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/basics/geo/faq/horizon|date=2007-09-27}}. Retrieved 1 February 2007. < /ref > 
 The second main river of Geneva is the [[Arve River]] which flows into the [[Rhône River]] just west of the city centre. 
 
 === Climate === 
 Geneva has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). Winters are cool and generally a little cloudy. During the winter, it is possible to have several days without thawing, and a day or two with severe freezes where the thermometer displays -10 & nbsp;°C. There are several days each month when, if anticyclonic conditions are stable, the clouds may stay for several days. From March, with temperatures rising it feels like summer in late May. However, the rain intensifies and often has a stormy character during the month of May. These may be short but strong storms depositing several [[centimetre]]s of rain within just a few minutes. Summers are often hot and rather humid, although some may be more changeable, the mornings remain relatively fresh. During the summer season, the rains are less frequent but more intense. This is the season where you most likely get thunderstorms with hail. If the weather in early September is still hot, it cools down quickly to become really cold in November. The morning frosts are then reappearing. [[Autumn]] is also the season of mists, and the month of October is often the month with the most fog in the year. The fog can be very intense, restricting vision to less than 100 m in the areas outside the city. 
 The highest temperature ever recorded in Geneva was {{cvt|39.7|C|F}} on 7 July 2015. < ref >  https://www.extremeweatherwatch.com/cities/geneva/highest-temperatures < /ref > 
 
 == Cityscape == 
 {{wide image|Rade Geneve.jpg|1500px|}} 
 
 == Culture == 
 === Media === 
 The city's main newspaper is the [[Tribune de Genève]], a [[Newspaper|daily newspaper]] founded on [[1 February]] [[1879]] by [[James T. Bates]], with a readership of about 187,000. 
 [[Le Courrier]], founded in 1868, was originally supported by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but has been completely independent since 1996. Mainly focused on Geneva, Le Courrier is trying to expand into other cantons in [[Romandy]]. Both [[Le Temps]] (headquartered in Geneva) and [[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]] are widely read in Geneva, but both actually cover the whole of [[Romandy]]. 
 
 Geneva is covered by the various [[French language]] [[radio network]]s of the [[Swiss Broadcasting Corporation]], in particular the [[Radio Suisse Romande]]. While these networks cover the whole of [[Romandy]], special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local frequencies in the case of special events such as elections. Other local station broadcast from the city, including RadioLac ([[Frequency modulation|FM]] 91.8 & nbsp;MHz), Radio Cité (Non-commercial radio, FM 92.2 & nbsp;MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0 & nbsp;MHz, also broadcast in [[Vaud]]), and [[World Radio Geneva]] (FM 88.4 & nbsp;MHz), Switzerland's only English-language radio station. 
 
 The main [[television channel]] covering Geneva is the [[Radio Télévision Suisse]] (RTS); while its headquarters are in Geneva, the programmes cover the whole of French-speaking Switzerland. Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Because Geneva is nearly surrounded by [[France]], many French television and radio channels can be picked up in Geneva. 
 
 === Entertainment === 
 
 '''Theatre''' < br / > 
 Most theatre in Geneva is in [[French language|French]], however there are several [[companies]] that stage regular [[English language|English]] productions. 
 
 '''Cinema''' < br / > 
 Movie going is a favorite activity in Geneva and there are plenty of theaters throughout the city. Most movies are dubbed into French.  Because of the number of English speakers in the city movies may also be subtitled. 
 
 '''Restaurants''' < br / > 
 In has over 1,000 restaurants, so it is the undisputed capital of cuisine in Switzerland. However eating out can be expensive, and many people drive the few kilometres over the border into France where prices are lower. 
 
 === Traditions and customs === 
 Since 1818, a particular [[chestnut|chestnut tree]] is used as the official  " herald of the spring "  in Geneva. The ''sautier'' (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical impact, the sautier issues a formal [[News release|press release]] and the local newspaper will usually mention the news. In 2007, the first bud appeared on [[2 March]]. 
 
 Geneva celebrates [[Jeune genevois]] on the first Thursday following a Sunday in September.  By local tradition, this commemorates when the news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Huguenots reached Geneva.  The Genevois (people of Geneva) joke that the federal equivalent holiday, ''Jeune fédéral'', is celebrated two weeks later on account of the rest of the country being a bit slow on the uptake. 
 
 Genevans also traditionally celebrate the failure of a Savoyard attempt to invade the city in 1602. The celebration, which takes place in December, is called L'Escalade, and includes a parade in the Old Town, a marathon, and numerous costume parties across the city. Inhabitants generally eat vegetable stew to commemorate a fictional character called Mère Royaume who is said to have thrown boiling hot soup on the Duke of Savoy's men when they were climbing the walls of the city during the night (hence the name L'Escalade, which means  " the climb "  in French). Traditionally, children are encouraged to knock on people's doors and sing songs in old Genevan, while teenagers generally throw eggs and flour at each other. Another tradition is to cross a pot made of chocolate filled with marzepan vegetables while saying  " and so perished the enemies of the Republic " . 
 
 === Sports === 
 The main sport team in Geneva is [[Servette FC]], a [[football (soccer)|football]] club founded in 1890 and named after a borough on the right bank of the Rhône River. Servette was the only club to have remained in the top league in Switzerland since its creation in the 1930s; however, in 2005, management problems caused the bankruptcy of the club's [[Holding company|parent company]], causing the club to be demoted two divisions lower. It is now playing in second division. Geneva is also home of the [[Genève-Servette HC|Genève-Servette Hockey Club]], who play in the Swiss [[Nationalliga A]]. 
 
 == Local government == 
 
 The city of Geneva is divided into 8  " quartiers "  or [[district]]s, often made up of several conglomerated neighborhoods. < ref > {{cite web|title=Districts of Geneva|publisher=Official Website of Geneva|url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/en/quartiers/index.htm|accessdate=2008-02-09|archive-date=2008-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113111654/http://www.ville-ge.ch/en/quartiers/index.htm|url-status=live}} < /ref >  On the Left Bank (Rive Gauche) these include Jonction, Centre / Plainpalais / Acacias, Eaux-Vives and Champel while the Right Bank includes Saint-Jean / Charmilles, Servette / Petit-Saconnex, Grottes / Saint-Gervaise and Paquis / Nations. 
 
 == Demographics == 
 As of 2005, the population of the Commune (city) of Geneva was 185,028, while 441,000 people lived in the Canton of Geneva; around 960,000 people live in the Geneva [[Residential community|urban community]], which extends into [[Vaud]] Canton and neighbouring France. 
 
 The population of the Canton is split between 148,500 people originally from Geneva (33.7%), 122,400 Swiss from other cantons (27.6%) and 170,500 foreigners (38.7%), from 180 different countries. < ref > [http://www.geneve.ch/statistique/statistiques/domaines/apercus/pop_etat.asp Population of Geneva] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402043815/http://www.geneve.ch/statistique/statistiques/domaines/apercus/pop_etat.asp |date=2007-04-02 }}, on the website of ''Statistique Genève''.

 While Geneva is usually considered a [[Protestant]] city, there are now more [[Roman Catholics]] (39.5%) than Protestants (17.4%) living in the Canton. 22% of the inhabitants claim not to be religious, the rest being shared between [[Islam]] (4.4%), [[Judaism]] (1.1%), other religions and people who did not respond. < ref > [http://www.geneve.ch/statistique/statistiques/domaines/apercus/lang_religion.asp Inhabitants of the Canton of Geneva according to their religion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615224644/http://www.geneve.ch/statistique/statistiques/domaines/apercus/lang_religion.asp |date=2011-06-15 }}, on the website of ''Statistique Genève''. Retrieved 1 February 2007. < /ref > 
 
 == Economy == 
 Geneva's economy is mainly [[service sector|services]] oriented. The city has an important and old [[Financial services|finance sector]], which is specialized in [[private banking]] (managing assets of about 1 trillion [[United States dollar|USD]]) and financing of [[international trade]]. It is also an important centre of [[Commodity markets|commodity trade]]. 
 
 Geneva hosts the international headquarters of companies like [[Japan Tobacco|JT International (JTI)]], [[Mediterranean Shipping Company S.A.|Mediterranean Shipping Company]], [[Serono]], [[SITA]], [[Société Générale de Surveillance]] and [[STMicroelectronics]]. Many other [[Multinational corporation|multinational companies]] like [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[DuPont]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[INVISTA]], [[Procter  &  Gamble]] and [[Sun Microsystems]] have their European headquarters in the city too. 
 
 There is a long tradition of [[watch]]making ([[Baume et Mercier]], [[Chopard]], [[Franck Muller]], [[Patek Philippe  &  Co.|Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex]], [[Raymond Weil]], [[Omega SA|Omega]], etc.). Two major international producers of [[flavour]]s and [[fragrance]]s, [[Firmenich]] and [[Givaudan]], have their headquarters and main production facilities in Geneva. 
 
 Many people also work in the numerous offices of [[international organization]]s in Geneva (about 24,000 in 2001). 
 
 [[Geneva Motor Show]] is one of the most important international auto-shows. The show is held at [[Palexpo]], a giant convention centre located next to the International Airport.  The show is so important that the [[Jet d'Eau]] is switched on for longer than usual because of all the visitors in the city during the show. 
 
 == Infrastructure == 
 === Transport === 
 The city is served by the [[Geneva Cointrin International Airport]]. It is connected to both the [[Rail transport in Switzerland|Swiss railway]] network [[SBB-CFF-FFS]], and the [[France|French]] [[SNCF]] network, including direct connections to [[Paris]], [[Marseille]] and [[Montpellier]] by [[TGV]]. Geneva is also connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland ([[A1 (Switzerland)|A1 motorway]]) and France. 
 
 [[Public transport]] by [[bus]], [[trolleybus]] or [[tram]] is provided by ''[[Transports Publics Genevois]]'' (TPG). In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network covers most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines extending into France. Public transport by [[boat]] is provided by the [[Mouettes Genevoises]], which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the ''[[Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman]]'' (CGN) which serves more distant destinations such as [[Nyon]], [[Yvoire]], [[Thonon-les-Bains|Thonon]], [[Évian-les-Bains|Evian]], [[Lausanne]] and [[Montreux]] using both modern diesel vessels and vintage [[paddle steamers]]. 
 
 Trains operated by [[SBB]] connect the airport to the main station of [[Cornavin]] in six minutes, and carry on to towns such as Nyon, Lausanne, Fribourg, Montreux, Neuchâtel, Berne, Sion, Sierre, etc. Regional train services are being increasingly developed, towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits, two new stations have been created since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the [[UN]] and the [[Botanical garden|Botanical Gardens]]) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge. 
 
 In 2005, work started on the CEVA (Cornavin - Eaux-Vives - Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, the Eaux-Vives station and [[Annemasse]], in France. The link between the main station and the [[classification yard]] of La Praille already exists; from there, the line will go mostly underground to the Hospital and the Eaux-Vives, where it will link up to the existing line to France. Support for this project was obtained from all parties in the local parliament. 
 
 Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance especially in the early morning or at peak hours.  In addition, which may be surprising in a modern country like [[Switzerland]], taxis often refuse to take babies and children.

 == Education == 
 The [[University of Geneva]] was founded by [[John Calvin]] in 1559. The [[International School of Geneva]] is the oldest international school in the world. It was founded in 1924 along with the [[League of Nations]]. 
 
 Geneva is also home to one of the most prestigious graduate schools of [[international relations]], the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]]. Other international schools include the [[International School of Geneva]] and [[Institut International de Lancy]] (founded in 1903). 
 
 The [[Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations]] is a [[private university]] located on the grounds of the Château de Penthes, an old castle with a park and view of [[Lac Leman]]. 
 
 The [[Canton of Geneva]]'s public school system has  " écoles primaires "  (4-12),  " cycles d'orientation "  (12-15), and the post-obligatory  " collèges "  (15-19), the oldest of which is the [[Collège Calvin]]. It is housed in the ancient buildings of the [[University of Geneva]], and could be considered one of the oldest [[public school]]s in the world. < ref > {{cite web|title=Du Collège de Genève au Collège Calvin (historique)|language=French|publisher=Geneva Education Department|url=http://wwwedu.ge.ch/po/calvin/histoire_college.htm|accessdate=2008-02-04|archive-date=2008-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218010603/http://wwwedu.ge.ch/po/calvin/histoire_college.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Geneva also has a wide choice of reputed private schools. < ref > {{cite web |title= Introduction to the Geneva Association of Private Schools |publisher= Geneva Association of Private Schools |url= http://www.agep.ch/eng/agep_presentation2.php |accessdate= 2008-02-04 |archive-date= 2008-01-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119133412/http://www.agep.ch/eng/agep_presentation2.php |url-status= dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Communities == 
 [[File:Geneve Lac.tif|thumb|Geneve, lac, 1816]] 
 As the Geneva authorities say, the history of the city is closely related to that of the foreign communities. Ever since the migration of foreigners to Geneva, these communities have found refuge, bringing their [[Procedural knowledge|know-how]], their customs and hope of a new life. They have widely participated in the international influence of Geneva, to its economic prosperity, and also to the spreading of views and of science.  
 === LGBT community === 
 Many other communities or minorities are also very well represented in Geneva, including sexual minorities, with no less than three organizations: [http://www.dialogai.org Dialogai], a gay organization; [http://www.lestime.ch Lestime], a lesbian organization; and [http://www.360.ch association 360], an [[LGBT]] organization. The [[Gay International Group (Geneva, Switzerland)]] is a good resource for gay foreigners, tourists or expatriates. Also, a new LGBT group has debuted within the University of Geneva itself, called  " Think Out " . This group addresses students and professors linked directly or indirectly with the matter of sexual diversity. 
 
 === Religious communities === 
 There are a lot of different communities in Geneva. Even if Geneva is supposed to be the Protestant Rome, many religions are represented in Geneva. The [[Plymouth Brethren]] have a thriving assembly there, established since the days of [[John Nelson Darby]]. Besides the Protestants, the Catholic religion becomes more influential thanks to immigration from Latin countries. The [[Kehilla|Jewish community]] is one of the oldest of Switzerland, and the more recent [[Ummah|Muslim community]] is emerging in this tolerant city.
