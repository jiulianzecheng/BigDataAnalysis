 The '''Gabonese Republic, ''' or '''Gabon''', is a country in [[Africa]]. It is located on the [[equator]]. It has borders with [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. Its capital is [[Libreville]], which is also the largest city in the country. Gabon has an area of almost {{convert|270000|sqkm}}. 1.5 million people live in Gabon. 
 
 Gabon was a [[colony]] of [[France]]. It became a new country on August 17, 1960. Since 1960, the country has had only 3 presidents. At first it had one-party rule. In the early 1990s, the country switched to a multi-party government. 
 
 Gabon is one of the richest countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. It has 4th highest HDI and third highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the region. Gabon has high levels of income inequality, and there are significant amounts of poverty in the country. 
 
 ==History== 
 Not much is known about the history of Gabon before European contact. The first people who lived in the country were [[pygmies]]. Later, [[Bantu people]] took over the area after moving down from the North. < ref > {{Cite web|title=History of Gabon - Lonely Planet Travel Information|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/gabon/history|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|access-date=2020-06-01|archive-date=2020-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724024348/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/gabon/history|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Not much is known of the local culture, other than tribal art that exists.  
 
 In the 15th century, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] were first Europeans to visit the area. At that time, the [[coast]] of Gabon was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Loango]]. < ref name= " Britannica " > {{Cite web|title=Gabon - History|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Gabon|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-06-01}} < /ref >  That was a state that included parts of what is today [[Angola]] and [[Republic of Congo]]. The Portuguese first settled on the islands of [[São Tomé]], [[Príncipe]], and [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]]. But they visited the coast of Gabon regularly. The Portuguese named Gabon region after their word ''gabão'' which means a coat with sleeve and hood. < ref name= " Britannica "  / >  Starting from the 16th century, the coast was used for [[slave trade]].  
 
 In the 19th century, the [[France|French]] made Gabon part of their [[Colonialism|Colonial empire]]. At this time much exploration was done of Gabon's dense [[jungle]]s. The explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] was one of the most famous to do so. In 1849, freed slaves founded [[Libreville]], which later became the [[Capital city|capital]].   
 
 In 1910 Gabon was one of the French colonies which formed [[French Equatorial Africa]] (together with Congo, [[Central African Republic]] and [[Chad]]). French Equatorial Africa lasted to 1959. On 17 August 1960, Gabon became a new country. 
 
 Since 1960, Gabon has only had 3 presidents. In 1961 [[Léon M'ba]] became the first president. In 1967 after his death [[Omar Bongo]] became the president and ruled the country to 2009. In 2009, Omar Bongo died and his son [[Ali Bongo Ondimba]] took over as president. In June 2022, Gabon joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. < ref > {{cite press release| url=https://thecommonwealth.org/news/gabon-and-togo-join-commonwealth | title=Gabon and Togo join the Commonwealth |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Nations]] |date=25 June 2022 |access-date=24 September 2022}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Geography== 
 [[File:DIGITAL CROSSING - KONGOU 03.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Kongou falls]] 
 Gabon is on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of central Africa. It is on the [[equator]]. Gabon generally has an [[equatorial climate]]. Rainforests cover 85% of the country. There are three distinct regions: the coastal plains (ranging between 20 and 300 & nbsp;km from the ocean's shore), the mountains (the [[Cristal Mountains]] to the northeast of Libreville, the Chaillu Massif in the centre, culminating at 1575 m with Mont Iboundji), and the [[savanna]] in the east. The coastal plains form a large section of the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]] and contain patches of [[Central African mangroves]] especially on the [[Muni River]] estuary on the border with [[Equatorial Guinea]]. 
 
 Gabon's largest river is the [[Ogooué]] which is 1200 & nbsp;km long. Gabon has three [[Karst topography|karst]] areas where there are hundreds of caves in the [[dolomite]] and [[limestone]] rocks. Some of the caves include Grotte du Lastoursville, Grotte du Lebamba, Grotte du Bongolo, and Grotte du Kessipougou. Many caves have not been explored yet. A National Geographic Expedition visited the caves in the summer of 2008 to document them ([http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/gabon-caves Expedition Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420132319/http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/gabon-caves/ |date=2009-04-20 }}). 
 
 ==Politics== 
 The first Gabonese president was Leon Mba. His successor was Omar Bongo, from 1967 until his death in 2009. Under his governance Gabon had just one political party between 1968 and 1990. It was called PDG. 
 
 ===Provinces and departments=== 
 Gabon is divided into nine [[province]]s. The provinces are divided into [[Departments of Gabon|departments]].

 # [[Moyen-Ogooué]] 
 # [[Ngounié]] 
 # [[Nyanga Province|Nyanga]] 
 # [[Ogooué-Ivindo]] 
 # [[Ogooué-Lolo]] 
 # [[Ogooué-Maritime]] 
 # [[Woleu-Ntem]]
