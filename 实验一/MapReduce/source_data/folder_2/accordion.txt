 An '''accordion''' is a [[musical instrument]] that has keys similar to a [[piano]], but is small enough for a person to hold. It makes [[sound]]s using [[air]] pushed and pulled through [[Reed (instrument)|reeds]] using a [[bellows]]. The accordion can also have buttons instead of keys. The [[6-plus-6-instruments|6-plus-6-system]] with three rows has the same fingering in all twelve scales.

 It was invented in Germany by Friedrich Buschmann in 1822. Since then, the instrument has made a significant impact on the world of modern and classical music. The accordion is similar to a portable piano. It is a wind instrument, comprising two reed organs that are connected by folding bellows.
