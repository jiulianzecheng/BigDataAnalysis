 The '''brain''' is the part of the body which lets living beings think. It does some bodily functions, such as telling the rest of the body what to do.  
 
 It gets input from [[sense organs]], and changes [[behavior]] in response to this information. In humans, the brain also controls our use of [[language]], and is capable of [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] [[thought]]. < ref name=Calvin > Calvin, William H. [1996] 1998. ''How brains think: evolving intelligence, then  &  now''. Phoenix, London. {{ISBN|0-75380-200-7}} < /ref >  The brain is the main control centre of the whole body. < ref > ''Encyclopedia of discovery: science''. Weldon Owen, 2001, 30{{ndash}}31. {{ISBN|1740893298}} < /ref >  The brain is made up of special [[cell]]s called [[Nerve|nerves]], which are connected with each other and with other nerves in our body.  
 
 In all animals, the brain is protected in some way. In ourselves, and all [[vertebrates]], it is protected by the [[bone]]s of the [[skull]]. In [[Woodpecker|woodpeckers]], the brain is protected by the [[tongue]], which wraps around the brain. 
 
 == Function == 
 The brain does the [[thinking]], learning, and feeling for the body. For humans, it is the source of [[consciousness]]. < ref > We do not know for sure whether other mammals have consciousness. < /ref >  The brain also controls basic [[autonomic]] body actions, like [[breathing]], [[digestion]], [[heartbeat]], that happen automatically. These activities, and much else, are governed by [[unconscious]] functions of the brain and [[nervous system]]. All the information about the world gathered by our [[senses]] is sent through nerves into the brain, allowing us to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel things. The brain processes this information, and we experience it as pictures, sounds, and so on. The brain also uses nerves to tell the body what to do, for example by telling muscles to move or our [[heart]] to beat faster. 
 
 This is generally true but some activity is caused by the [[spinal cord]] directly, for example, [[reflex]] actions do not involve the brain. In lower animals, a good deal is done without their brain being involved.  
 
 All [[vertebrates]] have brains and, over time, their brains have [[evolved]] to become more complex. < ref > Roth, Gerhard  2013. ''The long evolution of brains and minds''. Springer, Dordrecht. < /ref >  Some simple animals, however, like [[sponge]]s, do not have anything like a brain. [[Segmented]] [[invertebrates]] have [[ganglion]]s in each segment, and a ring of nervous tissue around the [[alimentary canal]] at the front. This acts to bring [[sense data]] from the front into play with the movement of the body. 
 
 == Parts == 
 In [[mammal]]s, the brain is made of three main parts: the [[cerebrum]], the [[cerebellum]], and the [[brainstem]]. The surface of the cerebrum is the [[cerebral cortex]], which all vertebrates have. Mammals also have an extra layer, the [[neocortex]]. This is the key to the behaviour which is typical of mammals, especially humans. < ref > Greenfield, Susan 1997. ''The human brain: a guided tour''. Phoenix, London. Author gave the 1994 [[Royal Institution]] Christmas Lectures, the first woman to do so since the series started in 1826. < /ref > 
 
 === Cerebral cortex === 
 The cortex has [[Sensory system|sensory]], [[Motor system|motor]], and association areas. The sensory areas are the areas that get and process information from the senses. The motor areas control voluntary movements, especially fine movements performed by the hand. The right half of the motor area controls the left side of the body, and vice versa. Association areas produce a meaningful experience of the world and supports abstract thinking and language. This enables us to interact effectively. Most connections are from one area of the cortex to another, rather than to subcortical areas; The figure may be as high as 99%. < ref > Braitenberg V. and Schüz A. 1991. ''Anatomy of the cortex: statistics and geometry''. NY: Springer-Verlag. < /ref > 
 
 === Thalamus === 
 The [[thalamus]] puts together the input from most of the [[senses]]. It is the place in the brain which makes the  " picture "  we have of the world outside us. The thalamus sits centrally under the [[cerebral cortex]]. 
 
 === Cerebellum === 
 The cerebellum coordinates [[muscle]]s so they work together. < ref name=igcse > {{cite book|title=Edexcel IGCSE Biology: Student Book|url=https://archive.org/details/edexceligcsebiol0000brad|page=[https://archive.org/details/edexceligcsebiol0000brad/page/n267 75]|date=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|first1=Phil|last1=Bradfield|first2=Steve|last2=Potter|isbn=9780435966881}} < /ref >  It is also the centre of keeping position and balance, and motor skills. It is one of the most ancient parts of the brain and sits at the back underneath the cerebral cortex. 
 
 === Brain stem === 
 The [[brain stem]] is at the back of the brain (actually underneath it in humans). It joins the rest of the brain with the [[spinal cord]]. It has lots of different parts that control different jobs in the body: for instance, the brain stem controls breathing, [[heart]]beat, sneezing, [[eye]] blinking, and swallowing. Body temperature and hunger are also controlled by parts of the brain stem. Roughly speaking, it deals with the more automated aspects of nervous function. 
 
 == Size == 
 The [[volume]] of the human brain (relative to the size of the whole body) is very large, compared to that of most other animals. The human brain also has a very large surface (called [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]) for its size, which is possible because it is very wrinkled. If the human cortex were flattened, it would be close to a square [[metre|meter]] in area. Some other animals also have very wrinkled brains, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[elephant]]s. Here is a [[rule of thumb]]: the larger an animal is, the larger its brain will be. < ref name=Calvin/ > < sup > p15 < /sup >  Even allowing for that, the human brain, and in particular the neocortex, is very large. We know it increased in size ''four-fold'' over the last several million years of [[evolution]]. < ref name=Calvin/ > < sup > p79 < /sup >  There are ideas about why this happened, but no-one is quite sure. Most theories suggest complex social activity and the evolution of [[language]] would make a larger brain advantageous. < ref name=Calvin/ > < sup > p80 < /sup > < ref > Pinker, Stephen 1994. ''The language instinct''. Morrow. p363 < /ref >  As an additional note, [[Einstein]]'s brain weighed only 1,230 grams, which is less than the average adult male brain (about 1,400 grams). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/ein.html|title=Neuroscience For Kids - Einstein's brain|website=faculty.washington.edu}} < /ref >  The detailed organisation of a brain obviously matters, but in ways which are not understood at present. 
 
 === Number of cells === 
 A human brain accounts for about 2% of the body's weight, but it uses about 20% of its energy. It has about 50–100 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] nerve [[cell]]s (also called [[neuron]]s), and roughly the same number of support cells, called ''[[glia]]''. The job of neurons is to receive and send [[information]] to and from the rest of the body, while glia provide [[nutrients]] and guide blood flow to the neurons, allowing them to do their job. Each nerve [[cell]] has contact with as many as 10,000 other [[nerve]] cells through connections called [[synapse]]s.
