 '''Isithembu''' means [[polygamy]] and is still a [[custom]] in many parts of [[Africa]]. Isithembu (also called Sethepu) is the [[Africa]]n custom of a man being able to have more than one [[wife]] at the same time. < ref name=Futhwa56 > Fezekile Futhwa, ''Setho: Afrikan Thought and Belief System'' (Alberton, South Africa: Nalane ka Fezekile Futhwa, 2011), p. 56 < /ref >  There were and are several situations that allow a man to have additional wives. A man may marry again if his current wife or wives cannot have children. He keeps his current wife or wives as divorce is not allowed. < ref name=Futhwa56/ >  She becomes the senior wife, a position of honor. A man may marry again if his current wife or wives have not produced male children. He can marry again if a wife does not want children. In some places, if a man dies, his wife or wives are married to his brother. < ref name=Futhwa56/ >  This way his family is cared for. The [[Swaziland|Swazi]] culture says a man should have many wives. Polygamy (Isithembu) is normal for men. < ref name=Brown89 > A. R. Radcliffe-Brown; Cyril Daryll Forde, ''African systems of kinship and marriage'' (London; New York: Oxford University Press, 1950), p. 89 < /ref >  Woman should have children, which is normal for them. < ref name=Brown89/ > 
 
 == Simple polygamy == 
 * Some African [[tribe]]s practice a simple form of polygamy. If a man marries one wife after another they have no rankings and are simply the number one wife, number two, and so on. Simple polygamy is one man (for example) married to two or more women. < ref > Diane J. Klein, 'Plural Marriage and Community Property Law', ''Golden Gate University Law Review'', Volume 41 | Issue 1 (27 January 2011), pp. 45â€“47 < /ref > 
 
 == Complex polygamy == 
 * Isithembu as practiced by the [[Xhosa people]] is a complex form of polygamy. < ref Name=GD > {{cite web |url=http://www.ghostdigest.co.za/articles/customary-marriages-and-estates/53226 |title=Customary marriages and estates |date=22 January 2009 |publisher=Ghost Digest |access-date=23 July 2015 |archive-date=1 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201110509/http://www.ghostdigest.co.za/articles/customary-marriages-and-estates/53226 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In this system a man's wives all have positions in the family. Where a man has two wives the family is divided into two branches called  " [[wikt:estate|estate]]s " . The [[wikt:household|household]] (wife, children, members of her family and servants) belonging to his first wife is called the  " great house "  (indlunkulu). < ref Name=GD/ >  His next wife's household is called the  " Right hand house "  (ukunene). < ref Name=GD/ >  If he takes a third wife, she and her children are [[wikt:affiliate|affiliate]]d to the great house. Hers is called a  " support house "  (iqadi). < ref Name=GD/ >  In some cases the third wife served the first wife as a servant before she was married. Should there be a fourth wife, she and her household are also iqadi and affiliated with the right hand house. 
 
 * The [[Zulu people]] also have a complex form of polygamy. A man's wives form a great house (indlunkulu), a right hand house (iqadi), and a left hand house (ikhohlwa). If there is a fourth or iqadi house, she does not have the same rights as the other three. < ref Name=GD/ >
