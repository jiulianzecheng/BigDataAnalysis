 '''Toner''' is a powder commonly used in [[photocopier]]s and [[Laser printer]]s to draw images and text onto [[paper]]. The early forms of toner were just [[carbon]] powder. Modern toners mix carbon with a [[thermoplastic]] and other materials. 
 
 In early machines, the user had to pour the toner into a [[reservoir]] on the machine itself. Current machines feed from a sealed [[Ink cartridge|cartridge]] which is normally a [[proprietary]] design. Although manufacturers try to make the process complicated, empty cartridges are sometimes refilled by third-party vendors. 
 Toner particles are melted by the heat of the [[fuser]], and bind to the [[paper]]. 
 
 == Health Risks == 
 Since toner is a fine dust, it can remain in the air for a long time, and is considered to have [[health effects]] similar to [[Chemically inert|inert]] [[dust]]. 
 It can be very painful to people with [[respiratory]] conditions such as [[asthma]] or [[bronchitis]]. 
 
 == Impact on the environment == 
 Many companies selling laser printers will also provide a way to return empty toner cartridges. These are commonly re-used, with new toner. Today, many toners have [[computer chip|chips]] which tell the printer how much toner is left. These chips also need to be re-programmed, when the toner is re-filled.
