 '''Seshat''' was the ancient [[Egypt]]ian idea of knowledge, shown as a [[deity|goddess]]. She became the goddess of [[writing]], [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]], [[architecture]], and [[mathematics]]. When [[Thoth]] became the god of wisdom, Seshat was seen as his daughter, or sometimes, as his wife. In [[art]], she was shown as a woman with a stylised papyrus plant above her head. This symbolised writing since the Egyptians wrote on a material that came from [[papyrus]].
