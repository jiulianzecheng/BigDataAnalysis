 ==Early life== 
 Kesha Rose Sebert was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], on March 1, 1987.  She was raised by her single mother, Pebe Sebert, and moved to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] in 1991.  She has one older brother and one younger brother.{{Cn}} 
 
 ==Career== 
 In 2005, Kesha was in an episode of ''[[The Simple Life]]'', which starred [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Nicole Richie]].{{Cn}} 
 
 Her first single  " [[Tik Tok]] "  reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada.   " Tik Tok "  became the best-performing song of 2010 in the United States.  She has sold 55 million records.{{Cn}} 
 
 In 2010, Kesha's first album ''Animal'' was released. Her first extended play ''Cannibal'' was released later that year.  Her third studio album, ''[[Warrior]]'', was released in 2012.{{Cn}} 
 
 In late 2013, Kesha was featured on rapper [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]'s single  " [[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]] " . The song reached number one in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US. 
 
 In July 2017, she released the single  " [[Praying (Kesha song)|Praying]] " , along with its music video, and announced a new studio album, ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]''.  The song reached the top 30 in Australia, the UK, US, and Canada.  It is notably different from her other singles because it does not use the dance-pop or electropop genres that she is known for. 
 
 Kesha released her fourth studio album, ''[[High Road (Kesha album)|High Road]]'', on January 31, 2020.  It entered the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart at number seven. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8XARX4gCgM/|title=Music Daily World on Instagram: ‚ÄúüîπMD: Chartsüîπ Kesha‚Äôs new studio album ‚ÄúHigh Road‚Äù has debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 with 45K units sold in its first week in the‚Ä¶‚Äù|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Personal life== 
 Kesha is a [[vegetarian]] and is openly [[bisexual]]. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Stichbury |first1=Thomas |title=EXCLUSIVE: KESHA ON BISEXUALITY AND BEING ABLE TO 'RUN FREE' IN HER RELATIONSHIP |url=https://www.attitude.co.uk/article/exclusive-kesha-on-bisexuality-and-being-able-to-run-free-in-her-relationship-1/22208/ |website=Attitude |date=November 7, 2019 |publisher=Attitude |access-date=31 October 2021 |archive-date=November 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108004407/https://www.attitude.co.uk/article/exclusive-kesha-on-bisexuality-and-being-able-to-run-free-in-her-relationship-1/22208/ |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 Early in her career, Kesha stated that the use of a [[dollar sign]] ('''$''') in her stage name was meant to be ironic, as she was not raised in a wealthy household. 
 
 In January 2014, Kesha entered rehab for treatment for an [[eating disorder]]. Her mother says that her disorder started when she was 18.  Later that year, she announced that her name would be styled back to ''Kesha'' instead of ''Ke$ha'', and her Twitter username was changed from @keshasuxx to simply @KeshaRose. 
 
 In February 2016, Kesha appeared in federal court in New York City to end her contract with Sony Music and the producer Dr. Luke‚Äîwho has produced many of her biggest hits‚Äîclaiming that he sexually and emotionally abused her.  The court ruled that Kesha is to remain under her contract with Sony but is able to work with other producers. However, Kesha's lawyers argued that remaining with the same label would not benefit her. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/02/24/kesha-thanks-freekesha-supporters-after-court-ruling/80844746/|title=Kesha thanks #FreeKesha supporters after court ruling|first=Jaleesa M.|last=Jones|date=February 24, 2016|website=Kesha thanks #FreeKesha supporters after court ruling|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=February 24, 2016}} < /ref >  Other recording artists, such as [[Lady Gaga]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Adele]], and [[Demi Lovato]], have shown support during Kesha's legal troubles.
