 A '''multivitamin''' is any of a group of [[vitamin]]s used often with [[mineral]]s needed by the [[human body]] to function properly. Multivitamins are available as tablets, capsules, pastilles, powders, liquids, and injections. Besides injections, multivitamins are recognized by the [[Codex Alimentarius Commission]] (the [[United Nations]]' authority on food standards) as a category of [[food]]. < ref > [http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/10206/cxg_055e.pdf Codex Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425084829/http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/10206/cxg_055e.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }} Accessed 27 December 2007 < /ref > 
 
 Multivitamins are often provided with minerals. A multivitamin or mineral set is approved in the United States as a (supplement) addition to a diet containing 3 or more vitamins and minerals that does not include [[herb]]s, [[hormone]]s, or [[drug]]s.  < ref > National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Panel. National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Conference Statement: multivitamin/mineral supplements and chronic disease prevention. Am J Clin Nutr 2007;85:257S-64S < /ref >  The terms multivitamin and multimineral are often used interchangeably. There is no scientific definition for either. < ref > [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/85/1/269S.pdf] Accessed 21 July 2009 < /ref >
