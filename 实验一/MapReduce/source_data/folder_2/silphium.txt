 '''Silphium''' was a plant that was used in [[classical antiquity]] as a seasoning and as a medicine. < ref name= " Tatman " / >  It is also known as '''''silphion''''', '''''laserwort''''', or '''''laser'''''. It was the essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of [[Cyrene]]. Most of the [[coin]]s from Cyrene show a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's [[resin]] (called ''laser'', '''''laserpicium''''', or '''''lasarpicium'''''). 
 
 Silphium was an important [[species]]. The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and the [[Minoan civilization]] of Knossos used a special [[glyph]] in their writing for the silphium plant. < ref > {{cite web |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes |title=Knossos fieldnotes |work=Modern Antiquarian |year=2007 |access-date=13 Feb 2009}} < /ref >  It was used by most ancient [[Mediterranean]] cultures. The [[Roman Kingdom|Romans]] considered it  " worth its weight in [[denarius|denarii]] "  (silver coins). Legend said that it was a gift from the god [[Apollo]]. 
 
 Which plant species silphium was is unclear. It is commonly believed to be a now-[[extinction|extinct]] plant of the [[genus]] ''[[Ferula]]''. < ref name= " Tatman " > J.L. Tatman,  " Silphium, Silver and Strife: A History of Kyrenaika and Its Coinage "  ''Celator'' '''14'''.10 (October 2000:6–24). < /ref >   The still-living plant species ''[[Ferula tingitana]]'' has been suggested as another possibility. < ref name = " Straight Dope " > [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/061013.html ''Did the ancient Romans use a natural herb for birth control?'',  Straight Dope,  13 October 2006] < /ref >  Another resin from different ''Ferula'' species, [[asafoetida]], was used as a cheaper substitute for silphium. < ref name=Dalby > {{cite book | last =Dalby | first = Andrew | title=Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices | publisher=University of California Press | year=2002 | isbn=0-520-23674-2 |page=18}} < /ref >  Asafoetida is still available.
