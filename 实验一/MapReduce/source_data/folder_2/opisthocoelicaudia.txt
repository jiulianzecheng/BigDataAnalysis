 '''Opisthocoelicaudia''' is a [[genus]] of [[titanosaur]] [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]. It is from [[Late Cretaceous]] rocks from [[Mongolia]]'s [[Nemegt Basin]]. In 1965 a well preserved skeleton was found, missing only a neck and head. 
 
 ==Possible synonymy with ''Nemegtosaurus''== 
 Scientists are arguing whether ''[[Nemegtosaurus]]'' is a synonym of ''Opisthocoelicaudia'' or its own genus, or vice versa.
