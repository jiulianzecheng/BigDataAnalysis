 '''Ikebana''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 生け花 or いけばな) is the [[Japan|Japanese]] art of making [[flower arrangement]]s.  The word  " Ikebana "  means  "  to make alive flowers " .  People who want to do Ikebana have to learn many things.  It is not just about putting flowers in a [[vase]].  Japanese flower arrangements often have special meanings. 
 
 There are many ways in which Ikebana can be taught.  These schools (ways of teaching) include [[Ikenobo]], [[Sogetsu]], [[Ohara]]. 
 
 Ikenobo is very well known.  Until the [[Mid-Edo]] Period it was only for [[upper class]] people.  Ikenobo was started by a [[Buddhist]] [[priest]] called Ikenobo Senkei in the [[15th century]].  It uses standing flowers (called  " rikka " ).  It is a Buddhist way of showing the beauty of [[nature]].  There are 7 branches.  Each branch represents something in nature, e.g. a [[hill]], [[valley]], [[waterfall]] etc.  Later, in the [[17th century]], it became simpler and was called  " shoka " .  Shoka uses just 3 branches called  " ten "  (heaven),  " chi "  (earth) and  " jin "  (man).   
 
 Another form of Ikebana is called [[cha-bana]].  It is used in [[tea ceremony]]. ikebana is used in homes too.  
 
 Today Ikebana is very popular among all classes of people in Japan.  15 million people in Japan practice Ikebana.
