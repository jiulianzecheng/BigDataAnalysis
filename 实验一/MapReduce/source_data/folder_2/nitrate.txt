 '''Nitrate''' (NO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > 1- < /sup > ) is a polyatomic [[ion]]. It is made up of one [[nitrogen]] and three [[oxygen]] atoms. It is part of many important [[molecule]]s. [[Potassium nitrate]] is a common type of nitrate. It is often used in [[fertilizer]]s because plants need both potassium and nitrates to live and grow. [[Sodium nitrate]] is also used in preserving foods. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The unhealthy preservative hiding in processed meats|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/sodium-nitrate/faq-20057848|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 Some nitrates are [[explosive]]. People make large amounts of nitrates from [[ammonia]]. Nitrates are similar to [[nitrite]]s. Many metal nitrates with thermal decomposition makes oxygen and metal nitrate. 
 
 [[Nitric acid]] has the formula HNO < sub > 3 < /sub >   and has no overall charge, because the hydrogen ion is positive.   
 
 Nitrate has a group [[valency]] of 1.
