 '''''Orthacanthus''''' was an ancient, fresh-water [[shark]] that had a long spine growing from the back of its skull. It had a very long dorsal fin, which ran all along the sharks back, giving it an [[eel]]-like appearance.  
 
 ''Orthacanthus'' was the terror of freshwater swamps and bayous in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Its body reached nearly 10 feet (3 meters) in length and its powerful jaws were lined with double-fanged teeth. 
 ''Orthacanthus'' lived from roughly 280 million years ago, from the Pennsylvanian period through the [[Permian]] period. They were around before the [[dinosaur]]s evolved.
