 The Sun appears to move against the background of stars because the Earth orbits the Sun. 
 
 The [[invariable plane]] is the average plane of the [[orbits]] of the [[planets]]. Properly, it is defined as the plane passing through its barycenter (center of [[mass]]). The present ecliptic plane is inclined to the invariable plane by about 1.5Â°.
