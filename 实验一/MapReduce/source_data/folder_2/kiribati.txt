 '''Kiribati''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɪr|ᵻ|ˈ|b|æ|s|,_|-|ˈ|b|ɑː|t|i}}) is an island [[country]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It has 33 [[atoll]]s, groups of tiny [[island]]s. The country is near the [[equator]]. Part of it is in [[Micronesia]] and part is in [[Polynesia]]. Its [[capital (city)|capital]] is [[South Tarawa]], on the [[Tarawa]] atoll. 
 
 Kiribati used to be called the '''Gilbert Islands'''. The name  " Kiribati "  comes from the way local people say  " Gilberts " . < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436752926|title=Traditional Micronesian societies : adaptation, integration, and political organization|last=Petersen|first=Glenn|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4416-1992-1|location=Honolulu|oclc=436752926}} < /ref >  In 1892, the Gilbert Islands became a [[Great Britain|British]] [[protectorate]] with the Ellice Islands (now known as [[Tuvalu]]), together called [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]]. Kiribati became an [[independence|independent]] [[republic]] in 1979. 
 
 [[Tourism]] is an important [[industry]]. Most food comes from farming and fishing. People grow [[breadfruit]], [[papaya]]s, [[coconut]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, and vegetables. The [[soil]] is not very good, but people use a special way of [[composting]] to make it better. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Find Agriculture expertise in Kiribati|url=https://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors-kiribati/business/agriculture/|access-date=13 February 2023|website=[[Commonwealth of Nations]]}} < /ref > 
 
 The official [[language]]s of Kiribati are [[English language|English]] and [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. 
 
 ==People== 
 As of 2020, about 119,000 people live in Kiribati. This is up from 103,000 in 2010, 84,000 in 2000, and 72,000 in 1990. Of these people, 90% live on the [[Gilbert Islands]], 10% live on the [[Phoenix Islands]], and only 41 people live on the [[Line Islands]]. The government says that 59% of people live in [[urban area]]s. 
 
 Almost all people in Kiribati have a religion. The largest religions are [[Catholicism]] (59%), [[Kiribati Uniting Church]] (21%), [[Kiribati Protestant Church]] (8%), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] (5%), [[Bahai]] (2%), and [[Seventh-day Adventist]] (2%). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Republic of Kiribati 2022 Census Report|url=https://nso.gov.ki/download/146/2020-census/1965/population-and-housing-census-report-2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220622095432/https://nso.gov.ki/download/146/2020-census/1965/population-and-housing-census-report-2020|archive-date=22 June 2022}} < /ref >   
 
 ==History== 
 The first people came to Kiribati sometime between 3000 BC < ref name=cind > Macdonald, Barrie (2001) ''Cinderellas of the Empire: towards a history of Kiribati and Tuvalu'', Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji, {{ISBN|982-02-0335-X}}, p. 1 < /ref >  and 1300 AD. < ref name=thomas > {{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Frank R. |year=2003 |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/AtollResearchBulletin/issues/00501.pdf |title=Kiribati: 'Some aspects of human ecology,' forty years later |journal=Atoll Research Bulletin |volume=501 |pages=1–40 |doi=10.5479/si.00775630.501.1 }} < /ref >  It is not known where they came from. Before this time, the islands may have been underwater. < ref name=thomas / > 
 
 European sailors saw the islands in the 1600s and 1700s. At this time, people only lived on the Gilbert Islands. (These islands were named after a British sailor, Thomas Gilbert.) In the 1800s, Europeans [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] many people and sold them as [[slave]]s. In 1886, the [[British Empire]] took the islands. The British tried to settle the Phoenix and Line Islands. < ref name=thomas / > 
 
 During [[World War II]], Japan took the islands. During the Cold War, the US tested [[nuclear weapon]]s there. In 1979, Kiribati became independent. Kiribati signed a  " Treaty of Friendship and Territorial Sovereignty "  (also called the  " Treaty of Tarawa " ) with the [[United States]] in 1979.  The USA gave up its claims to the islands of Canton, Enderbury, Hull, Birnie, Gardner, Phoenix, Sydney, McKean, Christmas, [[Caroline Island|Caroline]], [[Starbuck Island|Starbuck]], [[Malden Island|Malden]], Flint, and Vostok in that treaty. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.trussel.com/kir/treaty.htm | title=Treaty of Friendship Between the United States of America and the Republic of Kiribati }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Climate change== 
 [[Global warming]] and [[climate change]] are having big effects on Kiribati. The islands are very low above the water. The average height is 3 metres above [[sea level]]. Because of global warming, the sea level is rising. Land is sinking under the ocean. In the future, there may not be enough land to grow food. Salt water is also filling up [[aquifer]]s, where people store [[fresh water]]. Climate change causes unusual [[drought]]s and storms. These can make farming much harder. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Cauchi|first1=John P.|last2=Correa-Velez|first2=Ignacio|last3=Bambrick|first3=Hilary|date=2019|title=Climate change, food security and health in Kiribati: a narrative review of the literature|journal=Global Health Action|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1603683|doi=10.1080/16549716.2019.1603683|issn=1654-9716|pmc=6507958|pmid=31062666}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=McIver|first1=Lachlan|last2=Woodward|first2=Alistair|last3=Davies|first3=Seren|last4=Tibwe|first4=Tebikau|last5=Iddings|first5=Steven|date=14 May 2014|title=Assessment of the Health Impacts of Climate Change in Kiribati|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=11|issue=5|pages=5224–5240|doi=10.3390/ijerph110505224|issn=1660-4601|pmc=4053873|pmid=24830452|doi-access=free }} < /ref > 
 
 In 2012, the government purchased land on [[Fiji]]. This way, people from Kiribati could move there if needed. < ref > {{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/kiribati/9127576/Entire-nation-of-Kiribati-to-be-relocated-over-rising-sea-level-threat.html |location = London |work = The Daily Telegraph |first = Paul |last = Chapman |title = Entire nation of Kiribati to be relocated over rising sea level threat |date = 7 March 2012 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/kiribati-climate-change|title=Kiribati, the first country rising sea levels will swallow up as a result of climate change|accessdate=2023-10-10}} < /ref >
