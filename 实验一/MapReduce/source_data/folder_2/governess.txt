 A '''governess''' is a female person who works for a family, teaching the children in their home. She is not like a [[nanny]] who looks after them all day, dressing them etc. The governess's job is to be their teacher. She saw to their [[wikt:discipline|discipline]] and early education. Often girls received all their education from their governess (or sometimes a tutor), though boys usually went away to boarding school before their teen years, and then some went on to [[college]]. 
 
 Very few children nowadays have a governess, but it was quite common in the families of rich people until around the beginning of the [[20th century]]. In England quite a lot of young children who lived in the country, a long way from good schools, had a governess. When the boys were old enough they were sent away to a [[boarding school]]. 
 
 Governesses taught basic skills such as [[Reading]], [[Writing]] and [[Arithmetic]]. They may also have taught other skills such as [[French language|French]], [[piano]] playing and [[drawing]] or [[painting]]. Sometimes other teachers might be  
 
 A governess was not a [[domestic worker|household worker]], but she was not treated like a member of the family either. This meant that they were often quite lonely, and they usually ate their meals alone. For girls from a [[middle class]] background who were not married it was one of the only ways of earning a living. When the children she taught (her  " charges " ) grew up, she would have to find a new job. 
 
 [[Novel]]s of the time were usually about rich families, and a governess often comes into the story, e.g. in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' or [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[Agnes Grey]]''. Maria, the main character in ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', leaves the [[convent]] and becomes a governess to the children of the von Trapp family.
