 '''Ducks''' are [[bird]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Anatidae]]. Ducks are closely related to [[swan]]s and [[geese]], which are in the same family.  
 
 Ducks are not a [[monophyletic]] group. They are a '[[form taxon]]'. Swans and geese are in the same family but are not called ducks. The main difference is that ducks have shorter necks, and are smaller. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXJBBAAAQBAJ & dq=Females+of+most+dabbling+ducks+make+the+classic+%22quack%22+sound+but+most+ducks+don%27t+quack & pg=PA123|title=Bird Brains: inside the strange minds of our fine feathered friends | last=Titlow| first=Budd |date=2013|publisher=Rowman  &  Littlefield |isbn=9780762797707|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 Other [[swimming]] and [[diving]] birds, like [[grebe]]s and [[loon]]s, are not ducks. A baby duck is called a ''duckling'', and a male duck is called a ''drake''. Most ducks are [[water|aquatic]] birds. They can be found in both [[saltwater]] and [[fresh water]].  
 
 The [[subfamily]] [[Anatinae]] ( " dabbling ducks " ) feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. < ref name=Ogden/ >   
 
 Ducks lay eggs once a year and are [[omnivorous]], eating [[aquatic]] [[plant]]s and tiny [[animal]]s.  Along the edge of the beak there is a comb-like structure called a ''pecten''. This strains the water squirting from the side of the beak and traps any food. The pecten is also used to [[preen]] feathers. < ref name=Ogden > {{cite web  | last = Ogden   | first = Evans   | title = Dabbling ducks   | publisher = CWE   | url = https://www.sfu.ca/biology/wildberg/species/dabbducks.html   | accessdate = 2006-11-02  }} < /ref >  Diving ducks dive deep to get their food. 
 
 Many ducks are [[migratory]]. This means that they spend the [[summer]] months in a different place than the [[winter]] months. Ducks show a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], meaning they can be found all over the world, except for [[Antarctica]]. Some duck species live on the [[South Georgia]] and [[Auckland Islands]], which are [[subantarctic]]. Many species have established themselves on remote [[island]]s, such as [[Kerguelen]] or [[Hawaii]].  
 
 Ducks are sometimes kept as [[pet]]s. They are often kept by groups of people on public [[pond]]s for their beauty and calming nature. People commonly feed ducks in ponds stale [[bread]], thinking that the ducks will like to have something to eat. However, bread is not healthy for ducks and can kill them. In nature, ducks eat [[grass]]es, aquatic plants, [[fish]], [[insect]]s, small [[amphibian]]s, [[worm]]s, and small [[mollusc]]s.

 Some ducks are [[breed|bred]] and kept by [[human]]s. They are not wild ducks. They are kept to provide [[food]] ([[meat]] and [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]), or to use their [[feather]]s for [[pillow]]s and other items in the house. Especially in [[Asia]], many people like to eat duck. 
 
 Duck meat is high in [[fat]], which helps the bird float in the water. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Fat in Duck meat|url=https://fitaudit.com/food/102975/fat|access-date=2021-07-10|website=fitaudit.com}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Duck eggs|eggs from ducks]] are thought to have a richer taste than [[chicken]] eggs. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Mark|first=Jorie|date=2020-08-07|title=You should be using duck eggs for baking.
