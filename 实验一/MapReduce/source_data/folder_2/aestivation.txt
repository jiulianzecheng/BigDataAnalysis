 '''Aestivation''', < ref > from [[Latin]] ''aestas'',  " summer. " < /ref >  spelled '''estivation''' in the [[American English|US]], is one way an animal can go [[dormancy|dormant]], which is like being asleep. 
 
 Aestivation is similar to [[hibernation]], but the animal does it when it is hot instead of when it is cold. The animals stops moving and it slowly uses much less [[metabolism|energy (food)]]. The animal does this when the [[temperature]] is high and the [[weather]] is [[arid|dry]]. [[Lungfish]] have been doing this since the [[Devonian]] period millions of years ago. < ref > {{cite book|author=Miller, William Charles|title=Trace fossils: concepts, problems, prospects|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|isbn=9780444529497|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLDKUSoFmHMC & pg=PA206}} < /ref >  Many animals aestivate, including the [[Nile crocodile]], many [[snail]]s, and [[lady beetle]]s. < ref > Philip Withers, Scott Pedler  &  Michael Guppy. 1997.

 [[Invertebrate]] and [[vertebrate]] animals aestivate so they do not die from the heat or from [[desiccation|drying out]]. Both [[Land|land-]] and [[aquatic|water-living]] animals can do aestivation.
