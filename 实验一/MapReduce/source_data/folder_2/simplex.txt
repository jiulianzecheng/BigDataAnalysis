[[Image:tetrahedron.png|thumb|A 3-simplex or [[tetrahedron]]]] 
 In [[geometry]], a '''simplex''' (plural: ''simplices'' or ''simplexes''), sometimes called ''n-simplex'' is the ''n''-dimensional analogue [[wikt:figure|figure]] of the [[triangle]]. A triangle is a 2-simplex. The 0-simplex is the [[point (geometry)|point]], the 1-simplex is the line segment ([[line]] connecting two points). The 3-simplex is the [[tetrahedron]], and the 4-simplex is the [[pentachoron]]. 
 
 A '''regular simplex''' is a simplex that is also a [[regular polytope]]. A regular ''n''-simplex may be made from a regular (''n'' -  1)-simplex by connecting a new [[vertex]] to all the other vertices. All the vertices have the same length.
