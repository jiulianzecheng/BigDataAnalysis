 An '''oligosaccharide''' is a [[polymer]] of a few different simple [[sugar]]s. Oligosacchardides are [[carbohydrate]]s. When they are [[hydrolysis|hydrolized]], oligosaccharides give 3 to 10 monosaccharides. 
 
 Oligosacharides are formed when 3 to 10 monosaccharide units combine with each other by the loss of water molecules, resulting in the formation of a glycosidic linkage. Conversely hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields 3 to 10 monosaccharide units. Oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide. Oligosaccharides containing 3 monosaccharides are called trisaccharides.
