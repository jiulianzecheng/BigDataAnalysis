 '''Catalysis''' is the process of change in rate (speed) of a [[chemical reaction]] due to the help of a catalyst. Unlike other [[chemical]]s which take part in the reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself. A catalyst may participate in many chemical reactions. Catalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts. Catalysts that slow the reaction are called negative catalysts, or inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons.

 A '''catalyst''' is something which changes the rate of a [[chemical reaction]]. An example is when [[manganese oxide]] (MnO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) is added to [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 2 < /sub > ), and the hydrogen peroxide starts to break up into [[water]] and [[oxygen]]. Catalysts are either of natural or synthetic origin. Catalysts are useful because they leave no [[wikt:residue|residue]] in the [[solution]] they have sped up. A catalyst can also be used in a reaction again and again as it is not used up. There are many catalysts in our body which play an important part in many [[biochemical]] reactions. These are called [[enzymes]]. Most catalysts work by lowering the 'activation energy' of a reaction. This allows less energy to be used, thus speeding up the reaction. The opposite of a catalyst is an ''[[inhibitor]]''. Inhibitors slow down reactions. Some of them are found in snake [[Venom (poison)|venom]] and are dangerous for our nervous system or heart.
