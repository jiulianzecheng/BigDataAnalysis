 '''Thrice''' is an [[United States|American]] [[experimental rock]] [[band]] formed in 1998. They are always changing their sound from different [[album]]s. The four members in Thrice are the same four people as when they started 10 years ago. 
 
 In 2004, the band released a [[DVD]] about the band. In the DVD, it talks about the members. They talk about experiences with [[concert|touring]] and being in the band. They also talk about their ideas about the future direction of the music. 
 
 [[Dustin Kensrue]], the lead [[singer]] for the band, released a solo album in 2007. 
 
 Most recently, Thrice have released a four [[disc]] album titled ''The Alchemy Index'' (volumes ''Earth'', ''Fire'', ''Water'' and ''Air''). At the end of each disc, there is a song written in a similar [[poem]] style. The  last line in that song is always sung in the same way.
