 == Description== 
 The roadrunner is a large, slender, black-brown and white streaked ground bird which has an average weight of 8 to 15 ounces, and is about 18 inches (46 cm) to 22 inches (56 cm) from tail to beak. It has long legs, strong feet, and a big dark beak. The roadrunner is terrestrial (lives on land). Even though it can fly, it spends most of its time on the ground. When they fly their wings are short and rounded and have a white crescent on the feathers. Roadrunners and other members of the cuckoo family have [[zygodactyl]] feet (two toes on the front and two toes on the back). Roadrunners can run up to the speed of 20 miles per hour (32 km per hour). They fly to escape predators.Some Roadrunner run til 26 miles per hour. 
 
 == Habitat== 
 Roadrunners live in deserts of the southwestern U.S.A, Mexico and Central America.They also live in the sonoran desert 
 
 == Diet== 
 Roadrunners are [[omnivore]]s, meaning they eat both meat and plants. They eat [[insect]]s like [[grasshopper]]s, [[cricket]]s, [[beetle]]s, and [[caterpillar]]s, small [[reptile]]s like [[lizard]]s and [[snake]]s, [[rodent]]s and other small [[mammal]]s. They also eat [[tarantula]]s and other [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[snail]]s, small birds and [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. The plants they eat are [[fruit]]s and [[seed]]s like [[prickly pear]] [[cactus]] and [[sumac]]. Roadrunners search on the ground to find food. They usually run after their prey but also sometimes may leap to catch insects. Because of its fast speed, the roadrunner is one of the few animals that preys upon the [[rattlesnake]]. 
 The roadrunner is the only real predator of the [[tarantula hawk ]]. 
 
 == Nest and eggs== 
 The nest of roadrunner is made up of mainly sticks and sometimes leaves, and snake skin. A nest usually contains 2-6 eggs which are white colored. Roadrunners have bi-parental care. Both parents take care of the nest and feed the hatchlings, but males take care of the nest at night and females at day. For the first 1 to 2 weeks after the young hatch, one parent always remains at the nest. After the hatchlings are 2 to 3 weeks old they leave and never return to the nest.
