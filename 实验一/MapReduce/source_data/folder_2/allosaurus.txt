 '''''Allosaurus''''' was a large [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Jurassic]] period, a [[predator]]y [[carnivore]]. 
 
 ''Allosaurus'' averaged 8.5 [[metre]]s (28 & nbsp;ft) in length, though some remains suggest it could reach over 12 meters (39 & nbsp;ft). Its three-fingered forelimbs were smaller than its large hind legs, and the body was balanced by a long, heavy tail. < ref name=JM76 > Madsen, James H, Jr. 1993 [1976]. ''Allosaurus fragilis'': a revised osteology. 2nd ed, ''Utah Geological Survey Bulletin'' '''109'''. Salt Lake City: Utah Geological Survey. < /ref >  It weighed 2.3 tons. Allosaurus teeth were around 2.7-3.0 inches long this made it a scary ferocious pretator. 
 
 It is the most common large predator found in the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]]. This formation was laid down 155 to 145 million years ago, in the Jurassic. 
 
 ''Allosaurus'' was at the top of the [[food chain]]. It probably preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps even other predators (e.g. ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''). Potential prey included [[ornithopod]]s, [[stegosaur]]s, and [[sauropod]]s. 
 
 Some paleontologists think ''Allosaurus'' had cooperative  [[behavior]], and hunted in packs. Others believe they may have been aggressive toward each other. 
 
 Groups have been found together in the fossil record. This might be evidence of pack behavior, or just the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcass. 
 
 Remains of many individuals have been found, including some which are almost complete. Over sixty-nine individuals from one species have been found. < ref name=Holtz > Holtz, Thomas R., Jr.; Molnar, Ralph E.; and Currie, Philip J. 2004.

 [[Sauropod]]s, live or dead, seem to be likely candidates as prey. Sauropod bones with holes fitting allosaur teeth, and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones have been found. < ref name=FS04 > Fastovsky, David E.; and Smith, Joshua B. 2004.  " Dinosaur Paleoecology " , in ''The Dinosauria'', 2nd ed. 614–626. < /ref > 
 
 There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on ''[[Stegosaurus]]''. An ''Allosaurus'' tail vertebra has been found with a partially healed puncture which fits a ''Stegosaurus'' thagomizer. Also, there is a ''Stegosaurus'' neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an ''Allosaurus'' snout. < ref name=KSMW05 > {{cite book |author=Carpenter, Kenneth |title=The carnivorous dinosaurs|url=https://archive.org/details/carnivorousdinos00carp |year=2005 |chapter=Evidence for predator-prey relationships: examples for ''Allosaurus'' and ''Stegosaurus'' |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth |pages=[https://archive.org/details/carnivorousdinos00carp/page/325 325]–350 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |isbn= 0-253-34539-1 }} < /ref > 
 
 ''Allosaurus'' was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs. It had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by adult sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. 
 
 Researchers have made other suggestions. [[Robert T. Bakker]] compared the short teeth to serrations on a [[saw]]. This saw-like cutting edge runs the length of the upper jaw, and could have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim. < ref name=BB98 > {{cite journal |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |year=1998 |title=Brontosaur killers: Late Jurassic allosaurids as sabre-tooth cat analogues |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=145–158 |issn=0871-5424 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/10.pdf |access-date=2010-12-22 |archive-date=2007-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031040045/http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/10.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Another study showed the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. The authors suggested that ''Allosaurus'' used its skull like a [[hatchet]] against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without [[splinter]]ing bones but this is disputed by many scientists. 
 
 They suggested that different strategies could be used against different prey. The skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurs and sauropods. < ref name=ERetal01 > {{cite journal |last1=Rayfield |first1=Emily J. |year=2001 |title=Cranial design and function in a large theropod dinosaur |journal=Nature |volume=409 |pages=1033–1037 |doi=10.1038/35059070 |pmid=11234010 |last2=Norman |first2=DB |last3=Horner |first3=CC |last4=Horner |first4=JR |last5=Smith |first5=PM |last6=Thomason |first6=JJ |last7=Upchurch |first7=P |issue=6823|bibcode=2001Natur.409.1033R |s2cid=4396729 }} < /ref > 
 
 Their ideas were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern examples of a hatchet attack. They thought it more likely that the skull was strong to absorb stresses from struggling prey. < ref name=FK02 > {{cite journal |last1=Frazzetta |first1=T.H. |year=2002 |title=Prey attack by a large theropod dinosaur |journal=Nature |volume=416 |pages=387–388 |doi=10.1038/416387a |pmid=11919619 |last2=Kardong |first2=KV |issue=6879|s2cid=4388901 }} < /ref > 
 
 The original authors noted that ''Allosaurus'' itself has no modern equivalent, so the absence of a modern 'hatchet attacker' was not significant. They thought the tooth row was well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations (joints) in the skull helped to lessen stress. < ref name=ERetal02 > {{cite journal |last1=Rayfield |first1=Emily J. |year=2002 |title=Prey attack by a large theropod dinosaur: Response to Frazzetta and Kardong, 2002 |journal=Nature |volume=416 |page=388 |doi=10.1038/416388a |last2=Norman |first2=D. B. |last3=Upchurch |first3=P.|s2cid=4392259 }} < /ref > 
 
 Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like ''Allosaurus'' were 'flesh grazers' which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods, sufficient to sustain the predator so it did not need to kill the prey outright. This strategy might have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon again later. < ref name=Holtz/ >   
 [[File:Allosaurus skull front.jpg|thumb|right|''Allosaurus'' skull cast in front view at the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin]] 
 
 Another idea is that ornithopods, the most common available prey, could be subdued by ''Allosaurus'' grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making bites on the throat to crush the trachea. < ref > Foster, John 2007.  " Allosaurus fragilis " . ''Jurassic West: the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and their world''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press. pp. 170–176. {{ISBN|978-0-253-34870-8}} OCLC 77830875 < /ref >  The forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey, < ref name=KC02 > Carpenter, Kenneth 2002.

''Senckebergiana lethaea'' '''82''' (1): 59–76. doi:10.1007/BF03043773 < /ref >  and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. < ref > Gilmore, Charles W. 1920.

 The shape of the ''Allosaurus'' skull limited [[binocular vision]] to 20° of width, slightly less than that of modern [[crocodilia]]ns. As with crocodiles, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. < ref name=KAS06 > {{cite journal |last=Stevens |first=Kent A. |year=2006 |title=Binocular vision in theropod dinosaurs |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=321–330 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26[321:BVITD]2.0.CO;2 |s2cid=85694979 }} < /ref >  The similar width of their field of view suggests that allosaurs, like modern crocodiles, were [[ambush]] hunters. < ref name= " HistoryEvolveEyes " > {{cite episode |title=Evolve: Eyes |url=http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/tv_guide/full_details/World_history/programme_785.php |series=History channel Evolve |access-date=2010-12-22 |archive-date=2009-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628184336/http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/tv_guide/full_details/World_history/programme_785.php |url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Finally, the top speed of ''Allosaurus'' has been estimated at 30 to 55 & nbsp;kilometers per hour (19 to 34 & nbsp;miles per hour). < ref name=PC98 > {{cite journal |last=Christiansen |first=Per |year=1998 |title=Strength indicator values of theropod long bones, with comments on limb proportions and cursorial potential |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=241–255 |url=http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/19.pdf |issn=0871-5424 |access-date=2010-12-22 |archive-date=2008-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031093050/http://www.mnhn.ul.pt/geologia/gaia/19.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Cleveland-Lloyd discoveries == 
 The fossil site  known as the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Emery County, Utah|Emery County]], [[Utah]] was known in 1927, but major operations did not begin there until 1960. < ref name=WJS45 > {{cite journal |last=Stokes |first=William J. |year=1945 |title=A new quarry for Jurassic dinosaurs |journal=Science |volume=101 |issue=2614 |pages=115–117 |doi=10.1126/science.101.2614.115-a |pmid=17799203|bibcode = 1945Sci...101..115S |s2cid=13589884 }} < /ref >  An effort from nearly 40 & nbsp;institutions got thousands of bones between 1960 and 1965. < ref name=JM76/ >  The quarry is notable for the many ''Allosaurus'' remains, the condition of the specimens, and our ignorance of its ancient origin. It is estimated that the remains of at least 46 & nbsp;''A. fragilis'' have been found there, out of at least 73 & nbsp;dinosaurs. The fossils found there are disarticulated (separate) and well-mixed. 
 
 Suggestions as to how it arose include animals getting stuck in a [[bog]], to becoming trapped in deep [[mud]], to falling victim to [[drought]]-induced mortality around a [[waterhole]], to getting trapped in a spring-fed [[pond]] or [[seep]]. < ref name= " APHetal06 " > {{cite book|title=Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation|publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science|year=2006|editor=Foster, John R.|editor-first=|series=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, '''36'''|location=Albuquerque, New Mexico|pages=57–65|chapter=The taphonomy of the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]], Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, Utah: a re-evaluation|editor-last2=Lucas, Spencer G.|editor-last3=Hunt, Adrian P}} < /ref >  Regardless of the cause, the great quantity of well-preserved ''Allosaurus'' remains means the animal is one of the best-known theropods.

 ''Allosaurus'', like ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', has come to represent the quintessential large, carnivorous dinosaur in popular culture. 
 
 It is a common dinosaur in museums. A number of museums cooperated in excavations at the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry. By 1976, museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts. < ref name=JM76/ >  ''Allosaurus'' is the official 'state fossil' of [[Utah]]. < ref name=statefossil > {{cite web |url=http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/fossil.html |title=Utah Symbols & nbsp;– State Fossil |access-date=2010-06-16 |publisher=Pioneer: Utah's Online Library, State of Utah |archive-date=2010-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617044418/http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/fossil.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
