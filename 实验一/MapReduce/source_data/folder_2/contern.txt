 == History == 
 
 === Early History === 
 The Romans settled the country of [[Luxembourg]] in the BC era and at some point a road was constructed between [[Luxembourg City]] and [[Dalheim, Luxembourg|Dalheim]]. This road passed through what is today within the borders of the commune of Contern and also through the settlement of Faerschthaff. The Construction of this road saw a bridge of the [[Trudlerbaach]] River constructed, which still remains today. There is no proof that the settlement of Contern was founded during roman times, although it is widely believed so. The name Contern was first seen in a charter in 879/880/903/904 AD, although its first official listing was in 1128 and it is almost certain Contern dated back to the [[:en:Celts|Celtic]] Era.  In the 14th century it was wirtten as ''Guntrein.'' < ref > {{Cite book|title=Geschichte der Grundherrschaft Echternach im Frühmittelalter.|last=Wampach|first=Camille|publisher=Luxemburger Kunstdruckerei|year=1930|location=Luxembourg|pages=234–235|language=Luxembourgish}} < /ref >  Contern in the 13th century got a lot of influence from [[Christianity]] and [[Chivalry]]. At this time Contern became a parish and has its church built. From 1945 onwards, Contern's municipal structure was made up of Contern, Oetrange, Moutfort and Medingen. < ref name= " :5 " > {{cite web|title=Histoire de la commune|url=https://contern.lu/ma-commune/presentation/histoire-de-la-commune/|access-date=2022-02-26|website=Contern|language=fr-FR}} < /ref >  The Commune of Contern has existed since the 19th century 
 
 === Medieval History === 
 
 ==== Formation of the Commune ==== 
 Contern was formed as a parish in 1621. Later in 1684, neighbouring [[Oetrange]] became a parish and in 1707, [[Moutfort]] followed. At the time, the parish of Contern had no Lieu-dits although Oetrange was home to the settlement of [[Kackerterhaff]]. Moutfort was home to the setlements of [[Medingen]] and [[Millbech]] as well as the [[Moulin the Millbech]] and the farmstead of [[Pleitrange]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfrdjwEACAAJ|title=Map Guide to Luxembourg Parish Registers|last=Hansen|first=Kevin M.|publisher=Family Roots Publishing Company|year=2016|isbn=9781628590807|pages=138}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|title=Luxembourg Gazetteers|url=https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Luxembourg_Gazetteers|access-date=2023-03-31|website=www.familysearch.org}} < /ref >  By 1796 Contern was founded as an Arrondissement, this was home to several localities:

 Contern remained as an Arrondissement in the sense that it was formed in, in 1796 up until 1912, The exact time the commune as it is called today was formed is unknown, however the first census data from the commune dates back to 1821, so the commune is older than that. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite web|title=État de la population {{!}} Population structure - Portail Open Data|url=https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/etat-de-la-population-population-structure/|access-date=2023-03-31|website=data.public.lu|language=en}} < /ref >  The parish of Oetrange was absorbed into the parish of Moutfort in 1946, shortly after in 1948, the parishes of Contern and Moutfort were effectively dissolved. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 ==== Early mentions of Commune and settlements ====

 === Recent Growth and Expansion === 
 By 2001, the commune of Contern had a population of 3082, with the town itself having just 1065, the second largest in the commune. < ref name= " :2 "  / > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Population by canton and municipality|url=https://lustat.statec.lu/vis?pg=0 & df%5Bds%5D=ds-release & df%5Bid%5D=DF_X021 & df%5Bag%5D=LU1 & df%5Bvs%5D=1.0 & pd=, & dq=A. & vw=tb & lc=en|access-date=2023-04-24|website=lustat.statec.lu}} < /ref >  Also in 2001, Contern joined the Climate Alliance of European cities. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Strength in numbers|url=http://www.klimabuendnis.org/nc/kommunen/das-netzwerk.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806123507/http://www.klimabuendnis.org/nc/kommunen/das-netzwerk.html|archive-date=2018-08-06|access-date=2023-04-24}} < /ref > 
 
 === Archaeology === 
 Although no prominent archaeological sites or artifacts date back to the [[Celts|Celtic]] times, plenty has been left over since the Romans including some housing and remnants of an [[aqueduct]]. < ref name= " :5 "  / >  The most prominent thing from the Romans however is the Gallo-Roman villa, it stood on the current site of the town and there are still remains of it to this day. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Franziska Dövener - Academia.edu|url=https://independent.academia.edu/FranziskaD%C3%B6vener|access-date=2022-03-02|website=independent.academia.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 === Etymology === 
 Following [[World War II]], the Luxembourgers had strong distaste for their former German overseers. This was why almost every place in the country was renamed from its original Luxembourgish name of German origin, to that of [[French language|French]] origin without changing too much. Contern's name would have stayed Conter if it weren't for the French pronunciation of  " er "  being far too strong, thus an  " n "  was added on the end. It could have been possible to have followed what places like [[Hesperange]] did, but in the end it stuck to the name Contern. In the modern era, to encourage more Luxembougish in the commune, many documents and signs use  " Conter "  instead of Contern. 
 
 === Pilgrimages === 
 Conter has long been a target of many pilgrimages. In Contern, the sacred Walburga was offered to heal  " evil eyes "  or to do something against the  " evil gaze " . The Luxembourgish dialect poet Jakob Diedenhoven describes the course of these pilgrimages in an ironic way in 1830 in his ''prayer for Conter'': 
 
 : ''Zoo aalen Zeiten'' 
 : ''Vun alle Seiten,'' 
 : ''Zur Walburga,'' 
 : ''Der heel'ger Fra'' 
 : ''Gongen d'from Kreschten'' 
 : ''Den Aelter reschten'' 
 : ''Mat enger Kierz,'' 
 : ''Engem selv'ren Hierz'' 
 
 : ''Hier Aa'n ze g'nieren'' 
 : ''Ville' mam Schmieren'' 
 : ''Hoid se d'Gnood gin'' 
 : '' < nowiki/ > 'Rem ze gesin.'' 
 
 : ''Hei an der Scheier,'' 
 : ''D'Marre mam Freier,'' 
 : ''D'Ketche ma'm Franz'' 
 : ''Sti'schon am Danz'' 
 
 ... 
 
 : ''He'r we se sangen,'' 
 : ''Kuck we se sprangen,'' 
 : ''Daat weist de Kne,'' 
 : ''Daat eppes me.''
