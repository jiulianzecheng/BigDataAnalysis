 '''Luritja''' is the name of an [[Australia]]n [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] group of the [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]]. They speak the Luritja [[dialect]] of Wati, the language of the Western Desert people. The dialect itself has several varieties. The Luritja lands include areas to the west and south of [[Alice Springs]]. The region is centred on [[Kings Canyon (Australia)|Kings Canyon]]. Their neighbours are the [[Arrernte]] (east), the [[Warlpiri]] (north), the [[Pintupi]] (west), and the [[Pitjantjatjara]] (south). 
 
 In recent decades, many from this group have inter-married with [[Pintupi]]-speaking people. During the mid 20th-century, the Pintupi were [[Forced migration|forced to leave]] their lands and were settled into government-built stations. [[Papunya]] became a settlement for both Pintupi and Luritja. In the 1980s, many of these people moved back west to [[Kintore]]. Both communities now mainly speak a [[wikt:hybrid|hybridised]] dialect known as Pintupi-Luritja. 
 
 The name ''luritja'' is thought to come from the Arrernte word ''lurinya'', which means  " foreigner " . Over time younger generations have taken on the name as their [[ethnonym]]. < ref > {{cite book|author = Heffernan, John A.|year = 1984|title =Papunya Luritja Language Notes|location= Papunya | publisher=Papunya Literature Production Centre}} < /ref >  The total population of Luritja people (including those at Papunya) is probably in the thousands. This makes them the third largest of the [[Central Australia]]n Aboriginal populations, behind the Arrernte and Pitjantjatjara.
