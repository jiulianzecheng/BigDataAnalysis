{{Greek alphabet|letter=digamma}} 
 '''Digamma''' or '''Wau''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Ϝ ϝ ς''') was an old letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. It was used before the alphabet converted its classical standard form. It looked like a Latin  " F " , but it was pronounced like  " w " . In the 5th century BC, people stopped using it because they could no longer pronounce the sound  " w "  in Greek. However, they kept it as a sign for the number  " 6 "  in the system of [[Greek numerals]]. It was originally called  " Wau "  because of its sound. Later, when the sound was lost, it was called  " Digamma " , which means  " double [[Gamma]] " , because it looks like a Gamma (Γ) with two hooks. The Latin letter [[F]] was also taken over from Wau. 
 
 In [[mathematics]], the name  " digamma "  is used in [[digamma function]], which is the [[Derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of the [[logarithm]] of [[gamma function]] (that is,  < math > (\ln \Gamma (z) )' < /math > ). < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-20|title=Greek/Hebrew/Latin-based Symbols in Mathematics|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/greek-hebrew-latin-symbols/|access-date=2020-10-06|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Digamma Function|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DigammaFunction.html|access-date=2020-10-06|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Digamma Function {{!}} Brilliant Math  &  Science Wiki|url=https://brilliant.org/wiki/digamma-function/|access-date=2020-10-06|website=brilliant.org|language=en-us}} < /ref >
