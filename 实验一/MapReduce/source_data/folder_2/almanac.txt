Information about [[astronomy]] are also found in almanacs, such as the times of the rising and setting of the sun and moon, [[eclipse]]s, hours of full tide, stated festivals of churches, terms of courts, lists of all types, timelines, sports, and more. It can also be used to tell time, and is pocket sized. The first almanac was invented in 1457.
