 '''Tourism''' means people traveling for fun and adventure . It includes activities such as [[sightseeing]] and [[camping]]. People who [[travel]] for fun are called  " tourists " . Places where many [[tourists]] stay are sometimes called  " resorts " . Places that people go to for tourism are called tourist [[wikt:destination|destination]]s. 
 
 There are many reasons why people travel for fun: 
 * Some people travel to learn about the [[history]] or [[culture]] of a [[city]] or [[country]], or about the people who live there, or their ancestors. 
 * People from cold places sometimes like to relax in the sun. Many people from [[northern Europe]] or [[North America]] travel to warmer places and visit [[beach]]es. 
 * Some people travel to do an activity which they cannot do at home. There are many [[ski resort]]s in the [[Alps]] of [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]], and [[seaside resort]]s in [[Greece]] and other warm countries. 
 * People sometimes visit friends and family in another city or country. 
 * Finally, some people enjoy a change in [[landscape|scenery]]. City people go to [[forest]]s or [[desert]]s,  and vice versa. 
 
 == The tourism industry == 
 
 The tourism industry has different parts. Some of these are: 
 
 * Transport; such as [[airline]]s, [[railway]]s, [[boat]]s, and [[road]] transport. 
 * Places to stay; such as [[hotel]]s, [[camping]] grounds or parks, youth hostels, and [[bed and breakfast]]s. 
 * Food and drink; such as [[restaurant]]s, [[cafe]]s and [[Bar (business)|bars]]. 
 * [[Tour guide]]s know a place well, guide tourists to interesting places, and tell them about the place. 
 Package tour operators can offer all these services to a group who will go together. This can be cheaper than paying for them separately. 
 
 == Damage tourism can bring == 
 Tourism can bring damage to the local area, and/or the tourists. Litter, scuba-diving and [[deforestation]] are problems for popular places such as [[St. Lucia]], [[Hawaii]] and others. [[Scuba]]-diving can damage [[coral reef]]s which are home to hundreds of species of sea animals. Tourism can change [[culture]] when people learn each other's ways, and certain local [[custom|traditions]] are being put aside for tourists.
