A '''tachometer''' is a [[sensor]] that measures the [[rotation]] [[speed]] of an object, for example a wheel or shaft. There are different [[wiktionary:Method|method]]s to do so (for example, mechanical, optical, or magnetic). Most tachometers display the measurement in [[revolutions per minute]].
