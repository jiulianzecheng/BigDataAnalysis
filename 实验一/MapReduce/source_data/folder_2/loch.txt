 '''Loch''' is a [[Gaelic]] word for [[lake]]. It is commonly used in [[Scotland]]. < ref > In [[Ireland]] the word is '''lough''', and pronounced 'loc'. < /ref >  The 'ch' at the end is pronounced with a guttural (back of throat) sound which does not occur in modern [[English language|English]]. < ref > It is a voiceless velar fricative [[consonant]] with the [[Phonetics|phonetic]] [[symbol]] ''''x''''. < /ref >  There are also lochs in [[Ireland]], and the word is sometimes used in other countries. 
 
 The word is used both for [[lakes]], and for  " narrow or landlocked arms of the sea "  (OED). The word comes from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *l√≥kus ( " lake, pool " ). It is related to the [[Latin]] lacus ( " lake, pond " ) and English lay ( " lake " ). 
 
 Sometimes the term '''sea loch''' is used for saltwater lochs. Many other lochs are normal freshwater lakes, like [[Loch Lomond]]. 
 
 The spelling  " lough "  is often found in place names. In Lowland Scots and Scottish English, the spelling  " loch "  is always used.
