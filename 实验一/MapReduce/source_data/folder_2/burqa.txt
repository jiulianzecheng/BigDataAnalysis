 A '''Burqa''' is a piece of [[clothing]]. It is worn by some [[Muslim]] women. They can wear it as an outer garment. It only leaves a semi-transparent mesh in front of the woman's eyes, so she can see. The rest of the body is covered by it.  
 
 Other garments for Muslim women that cover less of their body are the [[hijab]] and the [[niqab]]. People often confuse the hijab and the niqab and call it burqa instead. 
 
 ==In Islamic texts== 
 The [[Quran]] does not say that women need to cover their faces with a veil, or cover their bodies with the full-body burqa. 
 
 ==Burqas around the world==
