 '''Virginia''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]]. Its [[Capital (city)|capital]] is [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and its largest city is [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]].  The official name of Virginia is the '''Commonwealth of Virginia'''. About 8.6 million people lived there in 2020. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Virginia is bordered (touching) by [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] (across the [[Potomac River]]) to the north, by [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, by [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] to the south, and by [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]] to the west. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Native American]]s were the first people to settle in Virginia. 
 
 Virginia became a state in 1788 after the [[American Revolution]]. Before it became a state of the United States, Virginia was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[Great Britain]]. Virginia was founded (started) in 1607 in [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. 
 
 The state of [[West Virginia]] was part of Virginia until the [[American Civil War]].  Virginia then left ([[secession|seceded]] from) the United States and joined the [[Confederate States of America]].  The western [[county|counties]] of Virginia seceded from Virginia to form a new state which was loyal to the Union.  After the end of the Civil War, Virginia became part of the United States again in 1870, but the counties that had left to start West Virginia did not join Virginia again. 
 
 Virginia is the state where eight United States [[president]]s were born. This is more than any other state. 
 
 The first [[African-American]] slaves were sent to Virginia. 
 
 == Economy == 
 Virginia has many [[Industry|industries]] like local and national government, military, farming, technology and business. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.farmflavor.com/virginia-agriculture/|title=Articles, facts  &  infographics about Virginia Agriculture|website=Farm Flavor|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.vedp.org/key-industries|title=Key Industries {{!}} Virginia Economic Development Partnership|website=www.vedp.org|access-date=2019-03-29}} < /ref >  Many Virginians work for the government because it is next to [[Washington, D.C.]]. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Department of Defense]], as well as the [[National Science Foundation]] are in Northern Virginia.  [[Farming]] is the largest industry in the state, making 334,000 jobs. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  [[Tomato]]es, [[peanut]]s, [[tobacco]], and [[hay]] are grown in Virginia. Technology is a fast growing industry. Virginia is 4th in technology workers after [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-10-04/business/35279112_1_tech-jobs-techamerica-foundation-jobs-in-software-services|title=Virginia loses tech jobs but maintains highest concentration in U.S. - Washington Post|date=2013-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117085622/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-10-04/business/35279112_1_tech-jobs-techamerica-foundation-jobs-in-software-services |access-date=2019-03-29|archive-date=2013-01-17 }} < /ref >
