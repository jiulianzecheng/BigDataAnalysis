 '''Permaculture''' is a way of managing [[land]] and designing communities by learning from [[nature]]. It copies natural patterns to get the most benefits with the least waste and energy. It promotes natural way of [[farming]] instead of modern [[Industry|industrial]] methods. The term 'Permaculture' was created by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in 1978. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Digital Library Of The Commons|url=https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/7956|access-date=2023-12-04|website=dlc.dlib.indiana.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 Critics say that permaculture doesn't have a clear definition and lacks a [[scientific]] basis and does not address real-world issues. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Accounts|date=2021-03-11|title=Permaculture for Sceptics|url=https://www.permaculturenews.org/2021/03/11/permaculture-for-sceptics/|access-date=2023-11-30|website=The Permaculture Research Institute|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Peter Harper.|date=2003|title=A Critique of Permaculture: Cleaning out the stables|url=http://academia-danubiana.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2.12.09.01_HARPER-A-critique-of-permaculture.pdf|access-date=30 November 2023|website=Academia-danubiana.net.}} < /ref > 
 
 == Foundational Ethics == 
 Permaculture is guided by three foundational ethics: < ref > {{Cite book|title=Permaculture: a designers' manual|last=Mollison|first=Bill|date=2004|publisher=Tagari|isbn=978-0-908228-01-0|edition=2.|location=Tyalgum}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|title=Permaculture: principles and pathways beyond sustainability|last=Holmgren|first=David|date=2002|publisher=Holmgren Design Services|isbn=978-0-646-41844-5|location=Hepburn, Victoria}} < /ref > 
 
 * Care of the Earth: Ensuring the continuation and multiplication of all life systems. 
 * Care of People: Providing access to resources necessary for people's existence. 
 * Setting Limits: Governing population and consumption to allocate resources for the above principles.

 Permaculture design copies natural patterns in [[ecosystem]]s to get the most benefits with the least waste and energy. The way permaculture is used can change depending on the Earth's region, and there's not much [[scientific]] literature about it. < ref > {{Cite web|title=A quote from Permaculture|url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10593799-the-tragic-reality-is-that-very-few-sustainable-systems-are|access-date=2023-11-30|website=www.goodreads.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Permaculture Zones == 
 [[File:Permaculture Zones.svg|thumb|Permaculture Zones 0-5.]] 
 Permaculture uses zones to organize elements in a human environment based on how often they're used and the needs of [[plant]]s or [[animal]]s. The zones are numbered from 0 to 5. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Permaculture: a Beginner's Guide|last=Burnett|first=Graham|publisher=UK: Spiralseed|year=2001|isbn=978-0-95534921-8}} < /ref > 
 
 * Zone 0: The home center, focuses on using natural resources like sunlight to reduce energy and water needs for a sustainable living environment. 
 * Zone 1: Closest to the house, includes often-used things like salad crops, herbs, and small fruits, as well as structures like greenhouses. 
 * Zone 2: A bit farther, has plants needing less regular care, beehives, and larger composting bins. 
 * Zone 3: The main crop area for home use and trade with less maintenance needed after setup. 
 * Zone 4: A partly wild space for foraging, collecting wild plants, and timber production. 
 * Zone 5: A wilderness area where humans don't interfere, acting as a natural reserve supporting the zones below it.
