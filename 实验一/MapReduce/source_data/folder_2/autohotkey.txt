 '''AutoHotkey''' is a [[free software|free]], [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[Scripting language|scripting]] [[programming language|language]] for [[Windows|Microsoft Windows]]. It allows users to create [[keyboard shortcut]]s or hotkeys, fast [[Macro (computer science)#Keyboard and mouse macros|macro]]-creation and [[software]] [[automation]]. It allows users to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application. User interfaces can be extended or modified by AutoHotkey. For example, replacing the Windows [[control key]] commands with their [[Emacs]] equivalents. < ref > {{cite web |author=Contact Erica Sadun: Comment |url=http://lifehacker.com/software/software/download-of-the-day-autohotkey-118270.php |title=Ericasadun 2005 Life Hacker |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date=2005-08-19 |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-date=2005-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024081723/http://lifehacker.com/software/software/download-of-the-day-autohotkey-118270.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The AutoHotkey installation includes a help file. Documentation is available on the internet. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm | title=Quick Reference  & #124; AutoHotkey }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Features== 
 AutoHotkey scripts can be used to load [[Computer program|programs]], open documents, and issue [[keystrokes]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] clicks. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm |title=AutoHotkey Tutorial: Macro and Hotkey Creation |publisher=Autohotkey.com |access-date=2011-12-02}} < /ref > 
 
 AutoHotkey scripts can also change [[Variable (programming)|variables]] and manipulate [[Window (computing)|windows]], [[Computer file|files]], and [[Directory (File system)|folders]]. 
 
 AutoHotkey scripts can be started by a [[Keyboard shortcut|hotkey]]. When the [[User (computing)|user]] presses a combination of keys, such as {{key press|Ctrl|Alt|I}} on the keyboard, a script could open a [[web browser]]. 
 
 Keyboard keys can be remapped, such that pressing {{key press|Ctrl|N}} might result in the [[active window]] receiving an [[Dash#En dash|en dash]] ( & ndash;). The same keys could be disabled, such that pressing {{key press|Ctrl|N}} might result in nothing happening at all. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/misc/Remap.htm |title=Remapping Keys and Buttons |publisher=Autohotkey.com |access-date=2011-12-02}} < /ref > 
 
 AutoHotkey also allows for 'hotstrings' that will automatically replace certain text as it is typed. A typical use for hotstrings is expanding abbreviations. Typing  " btw "  could be made to produce the text  " by the way " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm |title=Hotstrings and Auto-replace (similar to AutoText and AutoCorrect) |publisher=Autohotkey.com |date=2005-01-09 |access-date=2011-12-02}} < /ref > 
 
 Scripts can be started automatically when the computer starts. These could run in the background and could be used to write information to a logfile. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup |title=Hotkeys, Hotstrings, and Remapping |publisher=Autohotkey.com |access-date=2018-05-23}} < /ref > 
 
 More complex tasks can be making custom data entry forms ([[Graphical user interface|GUI windows]]), working with the [[Windows Registry|system registry]], or using the Windows [[Application programming interface|API]] by calling functions from [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]. The scripts can be [[Compiler|compiled]] into an [[executable]] file that can be run on other computers that do not have AutoHotkey installed. 
 
 The source code is in [[C++]] and can be compiled with [[Microsoft Visual Studio Express|Visual Studio Express]]. 
 
 Memory access through pointers is allowed just as in [[C (programming language)|C]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.autohotkey.com/changelog/ |title=AutoHotkey Changes and New Features, v1.0.47 - June 19, 2007 |publisher=Autohotkey.com |access-date=2011-12-02}} < /ref > 
 
 Some uses for AutoHotkey: 
 * Remapping the keyboard, such as from [[QWERTY]] to [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] or other alternative keyboard layouts. 
 * Using shortcuts to fill in frequently-used file names or other phrases. 
 * Typing punctuation not provided on the keyboard, such as [[Quotation mark#Curved quotes within and across applications|curved quotes]] ('''“'''…'''”'''). 
 * Controlling the mouse cursor with a keyboard or [[joystick]]. 
 * Opening programs, documents, and websites with simple keystrokes. 
 * Adding a [[signature block|signature]] to [[e-mail]] or [[Internet forum|message boards]]. 
 * Monitoring a system and automatically closing unwanted programs. 
 * Scheduling an automatic [[Reminder software|reminder]], system scan, or [[backup]]. 
 * Automating repetitive tasks. 
 * Filling out contest and freebie forms automatically (it could type in your name, address, and so on, automatically). 
 * [[Software prototyping|Prototyping]] before implementing in another, more time consuming, programming language. 
 
 ==History== 
 The first public [[beta version|beta]] of AutoHotkey was released on November 10, 2003. < ref name= " 2003to2004changelog "  / >  It was  based on the syntax on [[AutoIt]] v2. It used some AutoIt v3 commands and the AutoIt v3 compiler. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=19710#19710 |title=Author Chris Mallett's post on the AutoHotkey Forums |publisher=Autohotkey.com |access-date=2011-12-02}} < /ref >  AutoIt v3 changed its license from [[GPL]] to [[closed source]] because of  " other projects repeatedly taking AutoIt code "  and  " setting themselves up as competitors. " < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=7204 |title=Licensing Opinions - AutoIt Forums |publisher=Autoitscript.com |access-date=2011-12-02}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2010, AutoHotkey v1.1 (originally called AutoHotkey_L) became the platform for ongoing development of AutoHotkey. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=63474 |title=Forum post by Chris, announcing AutoHotkey_L now main platform |publisher=Autohotkey.com |access-date=2011-12-02}} < /ref >  In late 2012, it became the official branch. < ref name= " ourhistory " > {{cite web|url=http://autohotkey.com/foundation/history.html |title=The AutoHotkey Foundation : Our History |publisher=The AutoHotkey Foundation |date=2014-05-26 |access-date=2016-07-23}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Examples== 
 The following script will allow a user to search for a particular word or phrase using [[Google Search|Google]]. After copying text from any application to the [[Clipboard (computing)|clipboard]], pressing the configurable hotkey {{key press|Win|G}} will open the user's default [[web browser]] and perform the search. 
 
 < source lang= " autohotkey " > 
 #g::Run http://www.google.com/search?q=%clipboard% 
 < /source > 
 
 The following script defines a hotstring that enables the user to type  " afaik "  in any program and have it automatically replaced with  " as far as I know " : 
 
 < source lang= " autohotkey " > 
 ::afaik::as far as I know 
 < /source > 
 
 The example below makes {{key press|Ctrl|Shift|Q}} replace selected text in an editor with a quoted version of that text. It illustrates the use of functions, arguments and default argument values.  < syntaxhighlight lang= " autohotkey " > 
 ^+q::QuoteSelection()  ; Ctrl+Shift+Q 
 
 QuoteSelection() 
 { 
 	selection := GetSelection()  ; Get selected text. 
 	PasteText(Quote(selection))  ; Quote the text and paste it back. 
 } 
 
 GetSelection(timeoutSeconds := 0.5) 
 { 
 	Clipboard :=  " "   ; Clear clipboard for ClipWait to function. 
 	Send ^c  ; Send Ctrl+C to get selection on clipboard. 
 	ClipWait %timeoutSeconds% ; Wait for the copied text to arrive at the clipboard. 
 	return Clipboard 
 } 
 
 PasteText(s) 
 { 
 	Clipboard := s  ; Put the text on the clipboard. 
 	Send ^v  ; Paste the text with Ctrl+V. 
 } 
 
 Quote(s) 
 { 
 	return  " " " "  . s .  " " " " 
 }

 ==Malware== 
 Some [[malware]] has been written using AutoHotkey. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.cybereason.com/blog/fauxpersky-credstealer-malware-autohotkey-kaspersky-antivirus|title=Fauxpersky: CredStealer malware written in AutoHotKey masquerades as Kaspersky Antivirus, spreading through infecting USB drives|last=Research|first=Cybereason Nocturnus|access-date=2018-03-29}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Antivirus software|Anti-malware]] products sometimes falsely identify AutoHotkey scripts as malware.
