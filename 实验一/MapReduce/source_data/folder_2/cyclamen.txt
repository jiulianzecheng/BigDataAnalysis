 '''''Cyclamen''''' is a [[genus]] of 20 [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s. It is in the [[Myrsinaceae]] family. The genus is most widely known by its scientific name '''Cyclamen'''. It may also be called '''Persian violet''' (it is not related to the [[violet (plant)|violets]]), or '''primrose''' (neither is it a [[Primula vulgaris|primrose]]). This is because Cyclamen has been part of the Primulaceae families.  
 
 Cyclamen come from the [[Mediterranean]], from [[Spain]] to [[Iran]]. They are also found from northeast [[Africa]] to [[Somalia]]. They are [[perennial]] herbaceous [[aestivate|aestivating]] plants, with a surface or underground [[tuber]] (derived from the [[hypocotyl]]) 4-12 & nbsp;cm diameter, which produces [[leaf|leaves]] in late winter, and [[flower]]s in the autumn; the leaves die down during the hottest part of the Mediterranean summer [[drought]] to save water. Each leaf or flower grows on its own stem, which shoots up from the hypocotyl. The variegation is thought by some botanists to be a form of natural disruptive [[camouflage]] to reduce [[grazing]] damage by [[animal]]s.  
 
 The hypocotyl grows leaves and flowers on stems, either one flower or one leaf per stem. The stem for leaves and flowers appears identical except in height. The leaves grow on stems of around 6 & nbsp;cm height.
