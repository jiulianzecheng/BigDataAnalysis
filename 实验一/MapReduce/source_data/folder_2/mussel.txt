 '''Mussels''' are several [[family (biology)|families]] of [[bivalve]] [[molluscs]]. Mussels live in lakes, rivers, and creeks. They sometimes also live in [[intertidal area]]s along [[coastline]]s worldwide.  The [[freshwater mussel]]s (several allied families, the largest being the [[Unionidae]]) and [[saltwater mussel]]s (family [[Mytilidae]]) are not closely related, despite the fact that they may look similar. They are grouped in different [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]]es.  The freshwater [[Zebra mussels]] and their relatives (family [[Dreissenidae]]) live attached to rocks in a manner similar to marine mussels, but are classified with the Heterodonta, the taxonomic group including most bivalves referred to as  " [[clam]]s " . 
 
 From archeology, it is known that humans have been eating mussels for thousands of years. They can be cooked or eaten raw. Care must be taken however as mussels quickly become poisonous after they die.
