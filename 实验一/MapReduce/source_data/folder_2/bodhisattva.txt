{{Buddhism}} 
 A '''bodhisattva''' is a Buddhist who is on their way to become a [[Buddha]]. They have attained a certain level of [[enlightenment]], but decide not to enter [[Nirvana]] so that they can continue helping living beings in the world.  
 
 The word '''Bodhisattva''' can also refer to certain specific bodhisattvas such as [[Guan Yin|Avalokiteshvara]], [[Manjushri]] and [[Vajrapani]]. 
 
 Many bodhisattvas made a special [[vow]] that defines their personality or method of helping people. For example, Kshitigarbha vowed not to attain enlightenment until there were no more beings in hell. Some Buddhas, such as [[Amitabha]], made certain vows when they were bodhisattvas. He became a Buddha when these vows were fulfilled.
