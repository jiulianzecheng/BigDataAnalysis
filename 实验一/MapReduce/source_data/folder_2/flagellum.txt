 A '''flagellum''' (plural: ''flagella'') is a long, whip-like structure that helps some single celled organisms move. It is composed of [[microtubule]]s. They help [[propulsion|propel]] cells and [[organism]]s in a [[whip]]-like motion. The flagellum of [[eukaryote]]s usually moves with an “S” motion, and is surrounded by [[cell membrane]]. 
 
 Flagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller [[Cilia]]. So much so that it has been proposed [[protist]]s bearing either should be unified in the [[Phylum]] ''Undulipodia''. < ref > Margulis L  &  Dolan M.F. 2002. ''Early life: evolution on the Precambrian Earth''. 2nd ed, Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston. p89 < /ref >  Previously, Margulis had proposed that the [[Ciliate]]s alone should be placed in a Phylum ''Ciliophora''. < ref > Margulis L. Schwartz K.V.  &  Dolan M. 1999. ''Diversity of life: the illustrated guide to the five kingdoms''. Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston, p94. In this work the authors propose 19 phyla for the Protista, and call this 'Kingdom' the 'Protoctista', a term which is unfortunately almost unpronounceable. < /ref >  Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term. 
 
 Cilia and flagella are cell [[organelle]]s, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like [[mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s. It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]), and that the [[eukaryote]] cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'. < ref > Margulis L. and McMenamin 1990. Marriage of convenience. ''The Sciences'' '''30''', 31-36. < /ref > 
 
 == Types == 
 Three types of flagella have so far been distinguished; bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic. The main differences among these three types are summarized below: 
 
 * [[Bacterium|Bacteria]]l flagella are helical filaments that [[rotation|rotate]] like screws. < ref name=Silverman1 > {{cite journal |title = Flagellar rotation and the mechanism of bacterial motility |author=Silverman M.  &  Simon M  |journal=Nature |year=1974 |volume=249 |pages=73–74| pmid=4598030 | doi = 10.1038/249073a0 |issue = 452|bibcode=1974Natur.249...73S |s2cid=10370084 }} < /ref > < ref name=Meister1 > {{cite journal |title = Rapid rotation of flagellar bundles in swimming bacteria |author=Meister GLM, Berg HC  |journal=Nature |year=1987 |volume=325 |issue=6105 |pages=637–640|  doi = 10.1038/325637a0 |bibcode=1987Natur.325..637L |s2cid=4242129 }} < /ref > < ref name=Berg1 > {{cite journal |title = Bacteria swim by rotating their flagellar filaments |author=Berg HC, Anderson RA  |journal=Nature |year=1973 |volume=245 |pages=380–382|  pmid=4593496 | doi = 10.1038/245380a0 |issue = 5425|bibcode=1973Natur.245..380B |s2cid=4173914 }} < /ref >  They provide two of several kinds of bacterial motility. < ref name=Jahn1 > {{cite journal |title = Movement and locomotion of microorganisms |url = https://archive.org/details/sim_annual-review-of-microbiology_1965_19/page/21 |author=Jahn TL, Bovee EC  |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |year=1965 |volume=19 |pages=21–58 | pmid=5318439 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.19.100165.000321}} < /ref > < ref name=Harshey1 > {{cite journal |title = Bacterial motility on a surface: many ways to a common goal |url = https://archive.org/details/sim_annual-review-of-microbiology_2003_57/page/249 |author=Harshey RM |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |year=2003 |volume=57 |pages=249–273 |  pmid=14527279 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.57.030502.091014}} < /ref >

 * [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] flagella – those of animal, plant, and protist cells – are complex cellular projections that lash back and forth.  Eukaryotic flagella are classed along with eukaryotic [[Cilium#Motile cilia|''motile'' cilia]] as ''[[undulipodia]]'' < ref name=db2004 > [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O6-undulipodium.html A Dictionary of Biology], 2004, accessed 2011-01-01. < /ref >  to emphasize their distinctive wavy appendage role in cellular function or [[motility]].  [[Cilium#Primary.2Fimmotile cilium|''Primary'' cilia]] are immotile, and are not undulipodia; they have a [[Cilium#Structure.2C assembly and maintenance.2C and function|structurally different ''9+0 axoneme'']] rather than the ''9+2 axoneme'' found in both flagella and motile cilia undulopodia.
