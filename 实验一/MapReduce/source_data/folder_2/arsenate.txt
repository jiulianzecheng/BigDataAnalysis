'''Arsenate''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is AsO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 3- < /sup > . It has [[arsenic]] in its +5 [[oxidation state]].  
 
 Arsenates are [[salt]]s of [[arsenic acid]]. They are [[oxidizing agent]]s. Sometimes, not all of the [[deprotonation|protons are taken away]] from the arsenic acid and then hydrogen arsenate salts are formed. Their chemical formulas are HAsO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup >  or H < sub > 2 < /sub > AsO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > - < /sup > .  
 
 Arsenate can replace [[phosphate]] in the cells but it does not work like a phosphate does. The cell dies, and that is why arsenates are [[toxic]]. Some [[bacteria]] can use arsenate instead of phosphate, though. They are called [[arsenic bacteria]].  
 
 ==Occurrence== 
 Arsenates occur naturally in a variety of [[mineral]]s. Those minerals may contain [[hydrated]] or [[anhydrous]] arsenates. Unlike phosphates, arsenates are not lost from a mineral during [[weathering]]. Examples of arsenate-containing minerals include [[adamite]], [[alarsite]], [[annabergite]], [[erythrite]] and [[legrandite]].
