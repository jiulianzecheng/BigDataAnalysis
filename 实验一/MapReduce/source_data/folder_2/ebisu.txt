 ==Origins as Hiruko== 
 Ebisu was first named ''Hiruko'', meaning  " [[leech]] child " . He was the first child of [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]], born without bones (or, in some stories, without arms and legs) because of his mother's mistake in her marriage.  Hiruko tried hard to survive but he was thrown to the sea in a boat made out of reeds. < ref name= " Kojiki " > 
 {{cite web|year=1882|title=Kojiki|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/kojiki.htm|accessdate=2006-09-09|translator=B.H. Chamberlain}} < /ref >  He was eventually washed ashore and was cared for by the [[Ainu people]] ''Ebisu Saburo'' (戎三郎). 
 
 ==Life Story== 
 The weak child overcame many problems, grew legs, and became the god Ebisu. He remains slightly crippled and deaf, but is still joyful (which is why he has the title,  " The Laughing God " ). He is often shown wearing a tall hat — the ''Kazaori Eboshi'' (風折烏帽子) — holding a [[fishing rod]] and a large [[sea bass]]. 
 
 ==In Popular Culture==
