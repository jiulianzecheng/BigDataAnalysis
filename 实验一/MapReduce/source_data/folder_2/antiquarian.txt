 An '''antiquarian''' or '''antiquary''' (from the {{lang-la|antiquarius}}, meaning related to [[Ancient history|ancient]] times) is a [[student]] of [[wikt:antiquities|antiquities]] or things of the past. More [[wikt:specific|specific]]ally, the term is used for those who [[Research|study]] [[history]] with particular attention to ancient [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. This includes [[archaeological]] and [[History|historic]] [[Archaeological site|sites]], or historic [[archive]]s and [[manuscript]]s. The essence of antiquarianism is a focus on the [[wikt:empirical|empirical]] evidence of the past. It may be better explained by the motto adopted by the 18th-century antiquary, Sir Richard Colt Hoare,  " We speak from facts not theory " .  
 
 == Antiquarian societies == 
 In the [[18th century]] a new form of [[humanism]] emerged. [[wikt:Learned|Learned]] men and those interested in history formed new antiquarian [[wikt:society|societies]]. < ref name=Momigliano285 > Arnaldo Momigliano, 'Ancient History and the Antiquarian', ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 13, No. 3/4 (1950), p. 285 < /ref >  They were not associated with [[university|universities]]. They were formed by [[wikt:gentlemen|gentlemen]] of [[wikt:means|means]] and [[wikt:leisure|leisure]], < ref name=Brown77 > ''Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1988'', ed. R. Allen Brown (Woodbridge, Suffolk; Wolfeboro, NH: Boydell Press, 1989), p. 77 < /ref >  They had a growing interest in [[ancient Greece]]. A fortunate few, mainly [[England|Englishmen]] and [[France|Frenchmen]], could visit these sites. A lucky few could even afford [[book]]s illustrating these antiquities. < ref name=Momigliano285/ >  Many early antiquarians were self-taught. These gentlemen scholars prepared [[wikt:paper|paper]]s on their findings and [[debate]]d these in the society [[meeting]]s. At times they disagreed with the new [[wikt:academic|academic]] approach to history. By the end of the 19th century, antiquarianism had been replaced by a number of more specialized academic disciplines. These included [[archaeology]], [[art history]], [[numismatics]], [[sigillography]], [[philology]], [[Literary criticism|literary studies]] and [[diplomatics]]. Today the term is often used in a [[pejorative]] sense. It is used to refer to a very narrow [[wikt:focus|focus]] on historical [[wikt: |trivia]] instead of the actual history.  
 
 An antiquarian may also be someone who collect or study [[wikt:antique|antique]]s. < ref > [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/antiquarian English definition of “antiquarian”] < /ref >
