 '''Baboons''' are monkeys of the [[genus]] '''''Papio'''''. They are one of the largest kinds of monkey. It is an intelligent [[Old World]] [[monkey]]. It lives on the ground in groups called troops. Troops can be as small as a few baboons or as big as several hundred members. 
 
 == Distribution == 
 Baboons live in [[forests]] and on [[savannah]]s in [[Africa]] and on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. As they move into the open land, the family groups come together into groups several hundred strong, led by adult males that work together to protect the others from predators. 
 
 == Diet == 
 Baboons are omnivores (they eat both plants and meat). They eat grasses, roots, [[insect]]s and other small animals, like [[lizard]]s, small [[mammal]]s, fish, birds, and [[snake]]s. In some places, they steal food from humans. 
 
 == Predators == 
 [[Leopard]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[African wild dog]]s, [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s and people hunt the baboon. To scare the predator away, baboons can show their eyelids, show their teeth, chase the predator, and make noise. 
 
 To understand their lives, one must see them in their natural environment. < ref > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCTrrM_1vIc Lions eating baboons. Nature Conservancy Documentary on You Tube] < /ref >
