'''Haploid''' is the term used when a [[cell]] has half the usual number of [[chromosome]]s. A normal [[eukaryote]] organism is composed of [[diploid]] cells, one set of chromosomes from each parent. However, after [[meiosis]], the number of chromosomes in [[gamete]]s is halved. That is the haploid condition. 
 
 In [[human|humans]], the diploid number of chromosomes is 46 (2x23). The number in haploid cells ([[sperm]] and [[Ovum|eggs]]) is 23. Some types of animals are haploid, such as male [[Hymenoptera]] ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s). This is a special [[genetic]] system called [[haplodiploidy]]. 
 
 Some plants and animals are [[polyploid]], with more than two sets of chromosomes. For example, one species of [[wheat]] is hexaploid, with six sets of chromosomes, although other species of wheat have only two sets. Because so many organisms are diploid, it can become confusing whether haploid refers to one set of chromosomes or more than one. The special term '''monoploid''' can be used; it means one set of chromosomes.
