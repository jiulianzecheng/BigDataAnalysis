 '''Kivitoo''' was an [[Inuit]] community. It was also a [[whaling]] station. < ref name= " Dictionary o/ Canadian Bios "  / >  It was on the northeast [[shoreline|shore]] of [[Baffin Island]] in [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]]. The Inuit families that lived in Kivitoo moved to [[Qikiqtarjuaq]] in the 1950s. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.qia.ca/en/Qikiqtarjuaq|title=Qikiqtarjuaq|website=Qikiqtani Inuit Association|access-date=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330174727/http://www.qia.ca/en/Qikiqtarjuaq|archive-date=30 March 2017}} < /ref >  Qikiqtarjuaq is {{convert|31|mi|abbr=on}} south of Kivitoo. 
 
 ==History== 
 In the [[20th century]], the [[Sabellum Trading Company]] created a whaling post at Kivitoo. This was to help the whalers that would stop there. The post was [[wikt:abandon|abandon]]ed in 1926. < ref name= " Dictionary o/ Canadian Bios " > {{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=7846|title=Niaqutiaq|last=Grant|first=Shelagh D.|website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=4 November 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 Kivitoo was a [[Distant Early Warning Line]] site. It's code was FOX-D. Right now, it is a [[North Warning System]] site. A short [[airstrip]] was built near Kivitoo around the time it became a Distant Early Warning Line site. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://lswilson.dewlineadventures.com/foxd/|title=Site: FOX-D|website=The DEWLine|last=Allinson|first=Martin|access-date=4 November 2018}} < /ref >  The people that were living in Kivitoo were moved to Qikiqtarjuaq in the 1950s by the Canadian government. This was supposed to be for their safety because three people that lived in Kivitoo were killed when ice broke under their [[igloo]]s. < ref name= " CBCArts "  / >  The people never came back to Kivitoo. The government had already [[wikt:demolish|demolish]]ed most of the buildings in Kivitoo. < ref name= " CBCArts "  / > 
 
 A [[documentary]] that was made by [[Zacharias Kunuk]] talked about Kivitoo. It is called ''[[Kivitoo: What They Thought of Us]]''. < ref name= " CBCArts " > {{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/arts/over-50-years-ago-tragedy-struck-this-nunavut-community-zacharias-kunuk-s-new-film-wants-answers-1.4870317|title=Over 50 years ago, tragedy struck this Nunavut community.
