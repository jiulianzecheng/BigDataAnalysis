 == Description == 
 In ''Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race'', Cartwright points out that the [[Bible]] calls for a slave to obey his master, and that if he does, the slave won't want to run away. 
 
 He claimed that the disease happened when masters  " made themselves too familiar with [slaves], treating them as equals " . < ref > Baynton, Douglas C.
