 A bath is also a place where people can sit in water (or other [[liquid]]s, often hot) for their [[health]]. This is where the town name [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] comes from. Public baths for relaxing were built in all parts of the [[Roman Empire]]. The earliest known baths on record appeared somewhere around mid-2000 [[BC]] in [[Knossos]], [[Crete]]. Another society known for their love of public bathing were the Romans. They invented the ''Thermae'', which were grand in size, while ''Balineaes'' were smaller in stature. Similar to the Greeks, the Romans also used these places for socialising, while the rich and wealthy would build their own private bathhouses at home. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Immerse yourself in the history of baths|url=https://victoriaplum.com/blog/posts/history-of-baths|access-date=2022-04-27|website=VictoriaPlum.com|language=en}} < /ref >
