 ==Positive use== 
 The term bogan is nowadays used to display a pride in being rough around the edges. In 2002, Michelle Griffin discussed the fact that ‘bogan’ is no longer being used as an [[insult]]. It is in fact a way to identify with the ‘Aussie’ culture that many [[Anglo‐Saxon]] Australian citizens are so proud of. < ref > {{cite web |title='Bogan' Polite or not?
