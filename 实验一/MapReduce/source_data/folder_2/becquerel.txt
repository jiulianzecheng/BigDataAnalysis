The '''becquerel''' (symbol '''Bq''') is the [[International System of Units|SI derived unit]] of [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]], defined as the [[activity (radioactivity)|activity]] of a quantity of radioactive material in which one [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] decays per [[second]]. 
 A petabecquerel is  [[1 E15|10 < sup > 15 < /sup > ]] times a becquerel,  < math > \frac{-dN}{dt}=\lambda N < /math >  s < sup > -1 < /sup > , s for second, dimensionally is it second minus one, i.e. inverse seconds. 
 
 The unit is named in honor of [[Henri Becquerel]].
