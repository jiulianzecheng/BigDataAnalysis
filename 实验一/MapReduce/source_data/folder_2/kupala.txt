 '''Kupala''' is a fictional [[goddess]] from [[Slavs|Slavic]] stories. She symbolizes peace, water, magic, plants, and the ability to have babies, even though old Slavic folks didn't actually pray to her. She has a twin brother named Kupalo who stands for male ability to have babies. Together with other gods, they make up a god of [[fertility]]. There's a special celebration called {{Ill|Kupala Night|en}} that her name comes from. < ref name= " Dixon-Kennedy " > {{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Russian  &  Slavic Myth and Legend|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofru0000dixo|last=Dixon-Kennedy|first=Mike|year=1998|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofru0000dixo/page/159 159]}} < /ref >  The festival is [[Christian]] not pagan. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Jacob Grimm]] wrote a book called  " Deutsche Mythologie "  in 1835. In this book, he mentioned that Russians called their [[summer solstice]] bonfires  " kupala " . He also wrote that some people said  " kupala "  is the name of Kupulo. Kupulo is a god of harvest. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Teutonic Mythology|last=Grimm|first=Jacob|others=trans. James Steven Stallybras|year=1835|page=624}} < /ref >  Many experts say the word  " kupala "  means someone who takes a bath. The word comes from  " kupat(i) "  which means to take a bath. But not all experts agree. They say  " kupala "  is the name of a god. People believed in this god before Christianity came. They say it is not about [[John the Baptist]]. < ref name= " :0 " >    ''[[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]]''. Kupala./''В. В. Иванов, В. Н. Топоров''.

 [[Vyacheslav Vsevolodovich Ivanov|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and {{Ill|Vladimir Toporov|en}} are two of these experts. They think  " kupala "  comes from the same old [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word as  " [[Cupid]] " . Cupid is the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] god of love. This old word means 'passion' or 'desire'. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 == Etymology == 
 {{Main|Kupala Night}} 
 Scholars now believe that nobody worshipped Kupala. They believe the name is derived from Kupala Night. Kupala Is believed to derive from the [[past tense]] conjugation of {{Lang|sla-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/kǫpati|kǫpati]]}} meaning to bathe, possibly to [[Baptism|baptize]] in the name of [[John the Baptist]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=/culture_art/traditions|url=http://russia-ic.com/culture_art/traditions/775|access-date=31 October 2014|publisher=russia-ic.com/}} < /ref >   [[File:Иван_Купала.Гадание_на_венках.2008.Доска,масло150х85_см.jpeg|right|thumb|240x240px|Simon Kozhin.

 This special day marks the beginning of summer and the sun. People call it Kupalo. In the 4th century AD, it became a day to celebrate John the Baptist's birth. He lived before Jesus Christ. When people turned to Christianity, they connected the name  " Kupala "  with the Christian name  " Ivan " . < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ivan Kupala Day|url=https://authenticukraine.com.ua/en/blog/kupala|access-date=2022-05-19|website=authenticukraine.com.ua|language=en-US}} < /ref >  This special day is known as  " Ivan "  and  " Kupala "  in [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]].  " Ivan "  is another way to say John, like John the Baptist.   " Kupala "  may come from an older Slavic word,  " kump " .  " Kump "  means a group of people together. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|title=/culture_art/traditions|url=http://russia-ic.com/culture_art/traditions/775|access-date=31 October 2014|publisher=russia-ic.com/}} < /ref > 
 
 Some people think these two holidays are related. They think it's because John baptized people by putting them fully in water. But the Kupala celebration happened  before Christianity. When people became Christian, they changed the Kupala celebration a little. They made it part of the Christian traditions that also have local stories. < ref name= " :1 "  / >
