 '''Obscenity''' is a [[term]] that is used to describe words, images or actions that offend the sexual [[morality]] most people have or had at the time. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tThSc__tVA0C & dq=obscenity+meaning & pg=PA13|title=The reinvention of obscenity: sex, lies, and tabloids in early modern France| last1=DeJean|first1=Joan|last2=Dejean|first2=Professor Joan|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-14141-1|location=|pages=13|language=en}} < /ref >  The word is often used in a [[law|legal]] context. The word goes back to the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''obscenus'', which meant  " foul, repulsive, or detestable " . 
 
 Even though the word has been used with a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] [[connotation]] for a long time, it can still have the meaning of  " inspiring disgust " . This is true in expressions such as  " obscene [[profit]]s "  or  " the obscenity of [[war]] " . It can simply be used to mean [[profanity]], or it can mean anything that is [[taboo]], indecent, abhorrent, or disgusting. 
 
 The definition of what is thought of as obscene depends on the [[culture]]. Different [[community|communities]] and individuals may have different ideas of what is obscene and what is not. The definition of what is considered obscene also changes with time. Things that were obscene at one time no longer are at another. 
 
 Many cultures have made [[law]]s to define what is considered to be obscene. [[Censorship]] is often used to try to suppress or control materials that are obscene under these definitions. These usually include [[pornography|pornographic]] material.
