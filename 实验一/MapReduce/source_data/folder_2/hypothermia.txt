 '''Hypothermia''' is a condition when a person is so cold that the body temperature drops below normal. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Karakitsos D, Karabinis A |title=Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=11 |pages=1179–80 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18788094 }} < /ref >  Hypothermia is any body temperature lower than {{convert|35.0|C|F}}. Someone with hypothermia starts shivering and cannot stop. The person then becomes confused and acts strange. Their words don't make sense and they may be clumsy. Sometimes they become very tired. If someone gets hypothermia, wrap the person in blankets and take them to the [[hospital]]. If that's impossible, warm up the person slowly and give them a warm drink. < ref name=cream/ >

 When hypothermia begins, a person feels cold, starts shivering and cannot stop. < ref name=cream > {{cite book | last = Oard| first = Michael| title = The Weather Book| publisher = Master Books| date = 1997| location = P.O.

They are also unable to touch their thumb with their little finger, because their hand muscles don't work well. 
 
 Mild hypothermia is sometimes used on purpose by doctors for treating some medical problems. It takes blood away from the skin, hands and feet, and puts it to the brain and important internal organs. This helps when the person is bleeding from cuts or other wounds, and also helps when the patient goes into [[cardiac arrest]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=induced hypothermia|journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care  &  Pain |date=February 2006 |volume=6 |pages=23–27 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/1/23.full|publisher=Oxford Journals|doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mki064 |access-date=22 February 2014|last1=Luscombe |first1=Mark |last2=Andrzejowski |first2=John C. }} < /ref > 
 
 == Moderate (Middle) == 
 The person begins shivering very strongly. Their large muscles do not work well. < ref name=sterba/ > < ref name=cheung > {{cite journal |author=Cheung SS, Montie DL, White MD, Behm D |title=Changes in manual dexterity following short-term hand and forearm immersion in 10 degrees C water |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=990–3 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14503680 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000009/art00013 |access-date=2008-06-11}} < /ref >  They move slowly and with [[wikt:difficulty|difficulty]], growing a little confused and walking [[wikt:unsteady|unsteadily]]. < ref name=cream/ >  The person becomes pale, and lips, ears, fingers, and toes might become [[blue]]. This is because the body is trying to keep the most important [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] warm. The person might feel sick in their stomach and very tired, wanting to go to sleep, anywhere. < ref name=cream/ > 
 
 == Severe == 
 Body temperature drops even more, but the person usually stops shivering. < ref name=sterba/ >  They cannot talk clearly; they think slowly, and they cannot move their hands. Sometimes a person will feel suddenly warm, as if they are getting better, but this just means they are getting worse. They may take off warm clothes or lay down to go to sleep. If this continues, they cannot walk or answer questions. Their [[pulse]] becomes weaker, but the heart may beat faster. Finally, the person dies.
