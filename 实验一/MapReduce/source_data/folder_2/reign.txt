A '''reign''' is the period of time that a [[monarch]] (a [[king]], [[queen]], [[emperor]], etc.) rules over a [[country]]. < ref name=MW > {{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reign |title=reign |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |access-date=30 December 2015}} < /ref >  It can also be the period of time that a spiritual leader rules in a particular office. For example, the reign of a [[pope]], [[Dalai Lama|dalai lama]], [[patriarch]] etc. A reign can also be used for an office or championship. < ref name=MW/ >  In many cases a reign lasts until the monarch (or leader) resigns, dies, or is removed. A monarch's reign was sometimes used to mark time officially. In [[Anglo-Saxon England]] for example, many royal documents were dated by the [[regnal year]] of the king. < ref name=Jones21 > Michael Jones, ''A Handbook of Dates: For Students of British History'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 21 < /ref >  This lasted until about the [[10th century]]. < ref name=Jones21/ >
