 The '''curlew''' is '''''Numenius''''', a bird with a long downcurved bill (beak). With its beak the bird probes [[mud]]flats for food.  
 
 In pre-modern times the world had many more mudflats than it does today. Many have been eliminated by draining so as to give more land for [[farming]]. So, in [[England]], the places suitable for the bird were in river [[estuaries]] and low-lying land. Originally, southern England had wide areas of mudflats suitable for the bird. 
 
 What changed was the draining of the  " levels "  to make for better farming. In England areas in [[East Anglia]], [[Kent]] and [[Somerset]] were all drained and made productive farmland. A similar process happened in many countries. The consequence is that the curlews' numbers have dropped and the bird has become rare in places where it was once common. < ref > Bodsworth, Fred 1987.

 Broadly speaking, curlews are [[wader]]s, as are the [[godwit]]s which look similar but have straight bills. < ref name=Thomas > {{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Gavin H. | last2 = Wills | first2 = Matthew A. | last3 = Székely | first3 = Tamás | year = 2004 | title = A supertree approach to shorebird phylogeny | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.org/picrender.fcgi?artid=515296 & blobtype=pdf | journal = [[BMC Evolutionary Biology|BMC Evol.

 Most curlews migrate and so one or more species occur at different times of the year in Europe, [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Iberia]], [[Iceland]], [[Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Siberia]], [[North America]], [[South America]] and [[Australasia]]. There are nine [[species]] of curlew.
