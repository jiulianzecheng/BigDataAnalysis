 The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until [[Cyrus the Great]] established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and [[Persian people|Persians]], often referred to as the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

 Modern scholars question whether a Median empire even existed. It is argued that even if it existed, it must have been just a ''political alliance'' among highland neighbors of the [[Assyria]]ns.{{fact|date=September 2020}} The alliance might include [[Urartu|Armenia]] in southeastern Anatolia, [[Sagartians]] in modern northern Iraq, and the actual Medians in the area between what is today Hamadan-Kirmanshah in cental Zagros. Neither cuneiform sources, archaeological evidence, or biblical accounts, < ref > Liverani, Mario,  " The rise and fall of Media " , in : G. B. Lanfranchi, M. Roaf, R. Rollinger, eds., Continuity of Empire: Assyria, Media, Persia. Padova, Editrice e Libreria, 2003, pp. 1-12 < /ref >  support Herodotus, who claimed there really was a Median empire. 
 
 == Median language == 
 [[Strabo]] mentions the affinity of Mede with other [[Iranian languages]]  in his  " Geography " : 
 
 {{quotation|The name of ''[[Ariana]]'' is farther extended to a part of [[Persia]] and of Media, as also to the [[Bactrians]] and Sogdians on the north; for these speak approximately the same language, with but slight variations.|Geography, 15.8}} 
 
 Herodotus, mentions the word  " Spaka "  ( " Dog " , < ref > P. Lecoq, Les inscriptions de La Perse achémenide, Paris, 1997, pp. 46-49 < /ref >  still present in current Iranian languages such  as tat and  talysh, and different from Persian)
