An '''enthronement''' is a [[ceremony]] of [[inauguration]], [[wikt:involving|involving]] a person —usually a [[monarch]] or [[religious]] leader — who is [[wikt:formally|formally]] seated for the first time upon a [[throne]].  
 
 The throne is seen as a [[symbol]] of [[authority]]. 
 
 This [[ritual]] is different from a [[coronation]] because there is no crown. However, the term  " coronation "  and the term  " enthronement "  are often used to mean the same thing.
