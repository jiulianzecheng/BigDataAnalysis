 The '''lautenwerck''' is a [[keyboard instrument]]. It is also called the '''lute-harpsichord'''. Like the [[harpsichord]], it makes sound by plucking the strings with a [[plectrum]]. It uses [[gut string]]s instead of metal strings. The gut strings make the instrument sound like a [[lute]]. There are no lautenwercks from the 18th century which survive today.  < ref > {{cite web |last1=Ripin |first1=Edwin M. |last2=Wraight |first2=Denzil |title=Lute-harpsichord (Fr. clavecin-luth; Ger.

 [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] had two lute-harpsichords. It is thought that some of the music that he wrote for the lute is actually for the lautenwerck. < ref >
