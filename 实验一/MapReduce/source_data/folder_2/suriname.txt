 '''Suriname''' or '''Surinam''' is a [[country]] in [[South America]]. The official name of the country is '''Republiek Suriname''' (this is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and translates to ''[[Republic]] of Suriname''). It used to be known as ''Nederlands Guyana'', ''Netherlands Guiana'' or ''Dutch Guiana''. It is between [[Guyana]] and [[French Guiana]]. [[Paramaribo]] is the [[capital city]], in which resides almost half of the country's population. About half a million people live in the country. Suriname became independent from the [[Netherlands]] in [[1975]]. Before that, it was a part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. 
 
 [[File:Suriname with disputed territories.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Suriname, with the disputed territories shown]] 
 There are border disputes with [[French Guiana]] and [[Guyana]] all to the south of the country. 
 
 The [[industry]] of the country is centered on the [[mining]] and processing of [[bauxite]]. This makes up 15 percent of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] and more than 70% of the [[export]]s. Other exports are [[sugar]], [[crude oil|oil]] and [[gold]]. About 25% of the working people are employed in [[agriculture]]. The main trade partners are the [[Netherlands]], the [[United States]] and countries in the [[Caribbean]]. 
 
 Dutch, French, Spanish and English explorers discovered the area in the early 16th century. A century later, sugar [[plantation]] colonies were established by the Dutch and English along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains. After the second [[Anglo-Dutch War]] England traded any claims to the territory for [[New Amsterdam]] which became New York.
