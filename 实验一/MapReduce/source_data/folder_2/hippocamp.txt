 The '''hippocamp''' (also: hippocampe, hippokamp, or hippocampus, pl: hippocampi or hippokampoi) is a sea monster in [[Greek mythology]]. The creature has a horse's body and a fish's tail. It was not commonly pictured in Classical Greek art but when it is, it is sometimes ridden by the sea god [[Nereus]] or sea [[nymph]]s. The hippocamp plays no part in any known mythological tale. < ref > {{citation |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/130007869?img=1 |title=Terracotta bell-krater (mixing bowl) with lid |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=July 29, 2012}} < /ref >  The ancients believed it was the adult form of the [[seahorse]].
