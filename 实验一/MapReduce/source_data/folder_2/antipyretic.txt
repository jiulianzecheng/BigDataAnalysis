 '''Antipyretics''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|t|i|.|p|aɪ|ˈ|r|ɛ|.|t|ɪ|k|s}}, from the words ''anti-'' meaning 'against' and ''{{linktext|pyretic}}'' meaning 'feverish') are substances that reduce [[fever]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antipyretic |title=Definition of antipyretic|access-date=2007-12-19 |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}} < /ref >  Antipyretics cause the [[hypothalamus]] to ignore increases in [[Thermoregulation|temperature]] caused by [[prostaglandin]]. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever. 
 
 Most antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the [[United States]] are [[ibuprofen]] and [[aspirin]]. These are [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) used mainly as [[analgesics]] to relieve pain, but which also have antipyretic properties. [[Acetaminophen]] or ([[paracetamol]]), is an analgesic with weak anti-inflammatory properties. < ref > " [https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acetaminophen#section=Top Acetaminophen], "  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine].

 There is some debate over using medication to control fever. Fever is part of the body's [[immune system|immune response]] to infection. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fever/ID00052 |title=Mayo Clinic}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003090.htm |title=Medline Plus}} < /ref >  A study by the [[Royal Society]] found controlling fever causes at least 1% more [[influenza]] cases of death in the United States, which results in at least 700 extra deaths per year. < ref > {{cite news|last=Kupferschmidt|first=Kai|title=Fight the Flu, Hurt Society?|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/01/fight-flu-hurt-society|newspaper=ScienceNow|date=2014-01-21}} < /ref >
