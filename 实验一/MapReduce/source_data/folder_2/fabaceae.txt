 '''Fabaceae''' is the systematic name of the plant family that is commonly known as the [[Pea]] family. It consists of three subgroups: Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae and Papilionoideae (or better Faboideae). In modern systems like [[APG II]] this family Fabaceae is closely related to [[Quillajaceae]], Polygalaceae or milkworts (including the families Diclidantheraceae, Moutabeaceae, and Xanthophyllaceae), and Surianaceae. 
 
 == Description == 
 The [[Leaf|leaves]] are usually alternate and compound, in the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate (e.g. ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Mimosa]]''). In many species the leaves have structures evolved to attract [[ant]]s, that, being [[predator]]y, protect the plant from [[herbivore]] insects. Extrafloral nectaries -a gland secreting [[nectar]] -are common among the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae and are also found in some Faboideae (e.g. vetches ''Vicia sativa''). Fabaceae are typically entomophilous plants (i.e. they are [[Pollination|pollinated]] by [[insect]]s) and the flower are usually showy to attract the [[pollinator]]s. 
 
 In the [[Mimosoideae]] the flowers are radial symmetric or actinomorphic. In the [[Caesalpinioideae]] and Faboideae (see diagram) are most often zygomorphic or bilateral in simmetry.
