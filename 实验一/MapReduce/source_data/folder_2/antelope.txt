 '''Antelope''' is a term for many [[even-toed ungulate]] [[species]]. ''Antelope is not a strict [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] term'' because they are not a [[clade]]. Antelope is a '[[wastebasket taxon]]' in the family [[Bovidae]]. It includes the old-world species which are not [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[buffalo]], [[bison]], or [[goat]]s.  
 
 Antelopes occupy the [[ecological niche]] which [[deer]] occupy north of the [[Sahara]]. Both deer and antelopes are grass-eating mammals which have replaced [[browsers]] as the dominant vegetarian animals as [[forests]] gave way to [[grasslands]]. < ref > Vrba, Elisabeth S. 1995. ''Paleoclimate and evolution, with emphasis on human origins''. Yale University Press. < /ref > 
 
 Antelope are found mostly in [[Africa]] below the [[Sahara]], and parts of [[Asia]]. No antelope are native to [[North America]]: the [[pronghorn]] is a member of the family [[Antilocapridae]], another family. True antelope have [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] which are unbranched and never shed, while pronghorns have branching horns, and shed annually.  
 
 There are 91 species of antelope, most of which are native to Africa, in about 30 [[genera]]. < ref > Spinage C.A. 1986. ''The natural history of antelopes''. Facts on File Publications, New York. < /ref >  A group of antelope is called a [[herd]]. < ref > [http://www.hintsandthings.co.uk/kennel/collectives.htm Hints and things] < /ref > 
 
 Species of [[forest]], [[woodland]], or [[Shrub|bush]] tend to be [[wikt:sedentary|sedentary]], but many of the plains species undertake huge [[migration]]s. These migrations enable [[grass]]-eating species to follow the rains and therefore their food supply. The [[wildebeest|gnus]] and [[gazelle]]s of [[East Africa]] perform some of the most impressive mass migratory circuits of all mammals. < ref > Estes, Richard D. 1992. ''The behavior guide to African mammals''. University of California Press. < /ref >   
 
 All bovids have even-toed [[hoof|hooves]], horizontal [[Pupil (eye)|pupil]]s, [[Ruminant|ruminating]] guts, and (in at least the males) bony horns. 
 Many antelope are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. In most species, both sexes have horns, but those of males tend to be larger. There is a tendency for males to be larger than the females 
 
 Horns are not shed and are not made of bone, which distinguishes them from antlers. < ref > Prothero D.R.  &  Schoch R.M. 2002. ''Horns, tusks, and flippers: the evolution of hoofed mammals''. JHU Press. < /ref > 
 [[Gazelle]]s and [[springbok]] are known for their speed and leaping abilities. Even larger antelope, such as [[eland]]s, and [[kudu]]s, are capable of jumping 8 feet (2.4 m) or greater, although their running speed is restricted by their greater mass.
