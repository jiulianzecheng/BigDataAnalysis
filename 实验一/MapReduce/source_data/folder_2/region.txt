'''Region''' is a [[Geography|geographic]] term used in many ways in the different types of geography. In general, a region is a medium-scale area of land or water. It is smaller than the whole area of something (which could be, for example, the [[earth|world]], a [[nation]], a mountain range, and so on). A [[climate]] zone is one kind of region.  
 
 A region is larger than a specific [[wikt:location|location]]. It may be seen as a [[wikt:collect|collection]] of smaller things (as in  " the [[New England]] [[U.S. state|states]] " ) or as one part of a larger whole (as in  " the New England region of the [[United States]] " ). In some countries a region is a unit of [[local government]].
