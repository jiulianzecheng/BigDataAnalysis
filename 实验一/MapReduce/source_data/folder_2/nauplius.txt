 A '''nauplius''' (plural: ''nauplii'') is the first [[larva]]l form of most [[crustacea]]. It develops from the [[ovum|egg]], and may be followed by later stages before the adult form is reached. In some groups there can be as many as nine larval stages. < ref name= " Gurney " > {{cite book |author=Robert Gurney |year=1942 |title=Larvae of decapod crustacea |location=London |publisher=Ray Society |pages=1–306 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/12852/12852.pdf }} < /ref >  Sometimes the nauplius stage is passed through in the egg, and then a later stage emerges from the egg. < ref name=Gurney/ >
