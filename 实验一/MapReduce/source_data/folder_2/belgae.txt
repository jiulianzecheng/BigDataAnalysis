The '''Belgae''' were a group of tribes living in northern [[Gaul]].  They were on the west bank of the [[Rhine]], in the 3rd century BC.  Later they were also in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], and possibly even [[Ireland]]. They gave their name to the Roman province of [[Gallia Belgica]], and very much later, to the modern country of [[Belgium]]. 
 
 The Belgae came to Britain as raiders and settled in southern Britain shortly before the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] came. < ref > John Rhys, ''Celtic Britain'' (London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; New York: E.S.
