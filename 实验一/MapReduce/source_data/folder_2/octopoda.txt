 '''Octopoda''' is one of the largest [[order (biology)|orders]] which contain the common [[octopus]] and some other types. < ref > William Elford Leach, 1818. {{cite web|url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN & search_value=82589 |title=ITIS Report: Octopoda Leach, 1818 |publisher=Itis.gov |date=2013-04-10 |accessdate=2014-02-04}} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.helsinki.fi/~mhaaramo/metazoa/protostoma/mollusca/cephalopoda/coleoidea.html Helsinki.fi], Mikko's Phylogeny Archive: Coleoidea & nbsp;– Recent cephalopods < /ref >  Fossils are rare, but they do have a fossil record starting in the later [[Carboniferous]]. 
 
 Octopods are put into two suborders. One, the [[Incirrina]], is composed of the well-known ''[[Octopus]]'' of rocky [[shore]]s and [[coral reefs]] and its relatives. The other suborder, the [[Cirrina]], contains octopods whose tentacles are linked by an umbrella-like mantle, so their activity is rather different from the common octopus.
