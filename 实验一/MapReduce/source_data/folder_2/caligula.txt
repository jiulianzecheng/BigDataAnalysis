 '''Caligula''' (Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, 31 August 12 – 24 January 41) was the third [[Roman Empire|Roman Emperor]]. He reigned from AD 37. After only four years, he was [[assassination|assassinated]] by members of his [[bodyguard]] and the [[Roman Senate]]. During his [[reign]], many innocent people were killed without fair [[trial]]s. < ref > Barrett, Anthony A. 1989. ''Caligula: the corruption of power''. Batsford, London. {{ISBN|0-7134-5487-3}} < /ref >  Even with all that, he was popular with the Roman public in his time. 
 
 == Life == 
 Caligula's father [[Germanicus]] was the nephew and adoptive son of emperor [[Tiberius]]. He was a very successful general. He was one of Rome's most beloved public figures. 
 
 When Germanicus died at [[Antioch]] in 19 AD, his mother [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Elder Agrippina the Elder] returned to Rome with her six children. She had a bitter feud with Tiberius. That eventually led to the destruction of her family. Caligula was the only male survivor. In 31, he joined the emperor on the island of [[Capri]]. Tiberius had gone there five years earlier. When Tiberius died in 37, Caligula became emperor. 
 
 There are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign. He is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane [[tyrant]]. 
 
 Caligula worked to give more authority to the emperor. He put a lot of his effort into ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself. He started the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome: the ''Aqua Claudia'' and the ''Anio Novus''. During his reign, the empire took over the Kingdom of [[Mauretania]] and made it into a [[province]]. 
 
 In early 41, Caligula was assassinated. There was a conspiracy involving officers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], members of the [[Roman Senate]] and members of the imperial court. After Caligula's death, the conspirators' tried to bring back the [[Roman Republic]], but they were unsuccessful. The Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle [[Claudius]] emperor in his place.

 == Insanity? == 
 There are stories about Caligula that show cruelty and [[insane|insanity]]. He was accused of killing just for amusement. < ref > Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' III.xviii.1. < /ref >  He was accused of committing [[incest]] with his sisters and prostituting them with other men. < ref > Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#11 LIX.11], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#22 LIX.22]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#24 24]. < /ref >  He was accused of turning the palace into a [[brothel]]. < ref name =  " gjxxsj " > Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#41 41] < /ref > 
 
 Caligula appeared in public dressed as various gods. He demanded to be worshipped as a god. < ref > Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#26 LIX.26-28]. < /ref >  There was a legend that he appointed [[Incitatus|a horse]] to the priesthood. < ref name= " Guardian " > {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/caligula-with-mary-beard-review|accessdate=June 30, 2020|date=June 30, 2013|title=Caligula with Mary Beard – TV review|author=Tom Meltzner}} < /ref > < ref > Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 55; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28 LIX.28]. < /ref > 
 
 It is difficult to know anything for certain about Caligula. Only two sources from his time still exist. Those are the works of [[Philo]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. They give mostly [[wikt:anecdote|anecdotes]]. At one time, there were detailed histories on Caligula. Now they are lost. Caligula's sister, Agrippina the Younger, wrote an [[autobiography]] which certainly had a lot of information about Caligula's reign. It is also lost. No surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light. It is not known whether Caligula was insane.
