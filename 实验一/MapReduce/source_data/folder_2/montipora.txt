 '''''Montipora''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Scleractinia]]n corals in the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]]. There are 85 known species. < ref name= " ReferenceA " / > 
 
 ''Montipora'' corals are common on reefs and lagoons of the [[Red Sea]], the western [[Indian Ocean]] and the southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. They are entirely absent in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. 
 
 This coral grows in plates. It can cover huge portions of a reef. The coral is attached permanently to the ocean floor. It spreads out into thin, wide, leaf-like colonies. Larger colonies can grow out in multiple layers. Its surface is covered with many bumpy protrusions.
