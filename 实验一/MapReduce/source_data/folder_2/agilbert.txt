 === Wessex === 
 Agilbert studied in Ireland for several years. < ref name=Farmer6 > David Farmer, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', Fifth Edition Revised (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 6 < /ref >  In 650 he came to Wessex as a [[:en:wikt:missionary|missionary]]. < ref > Charles Dodd, ''Church History of England'', Vol. I (London: Charles Dolman, 1840), p. 44 < /ref >  Cenwalh, the king, was impressed by his background he offered Agilbert the [[:en:wikt:bishopric|bishopric]] of [[Dorchester]]. < ref > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 154 < /ref >  This was the seat originally given to Bishop Birinus who founded a church at Dorchester on Thames. < ref > Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 118 < /ref >  Birinus had died in 650 and Cenwalh was looking for a replacement. < ref name=Ashley304 > Mike Ashley, ''The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens'' (New york: Carroll  &  Graf, 1999), p. 304 < /ref >  But after some time Cenwalh grew tired of not being able to understand the bishop, who apparently did not speak the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon language]]. < ref > Peter Hunter Blair, ''The World of Bede'' (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990). p. 111 < /ref >  Cenwalh created a new [[diocese]] at Winchester in 660 and made [[Wine (bishop)|Wine]] the first bishop.{{efn|Wine was the third bishop in Wessex. Birinus was the first and Agilbert the second. < ref > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E.

 === Northumbria === 
 
 Agilbert did not leave England immediately but visited Northumbria. < ref > N. J. Higham, ''The Convert Kings: Power and Religious Affiliation in Early Anglo-Saxon England'' (New York: Manchester University Press, 1997), p. 255 < /ref >   
 A controversy had occurred in the Northumbrian church over the date of Easter. < ref name=Stenton122/ >  The king [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] and his son Eahlfrith each backed a different church position. Why Agilbert came to Northumbria at this time or who sent him is not recorded. But kings Osiwu and Cenwalh were friends. They both supported the Roman position that Easter should be celebrated the same throughout the [[Christian]] world. A synod was called at Whitby to settle the issue. < ref name=Farmer6/ >  Bishop Agilbert was the senior [[:en:wikt:ecclesiastic|ecclesiastic]] there who supported the Roman position. As he did not speak the language well, he asked [[Wilfrid]]{{efn|Wilfrid had been ordained a priest by Agilbert. < ref name=Farmer6/ > }} to speak for him. Their argument was why did only the remote parts of Britain celebrate Easter differently than the remainder of the Christian world? Osiwu made a decision to celebrate Easter with the rest of the Christian churches. < ref name=Farmer6/ > 
 
 === France === 
 
 Agilbert wandered in [[Gaul]] (later France) for a time before accepting the position of Bishop of Paris. He held that position from {{circa|667}} for about 12 years. He consecrated Wilfrid as a bishop at [[Compiègne]] < ref name=Farmer6/ >  along with several others. Later Bishop Wine was expelled from Wessex by Cenwalh. < ref > D. P. Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', Second Edition (London; New York: Routledge, 2000),p. 49 < /ref >  This left Wessex without a bishop. Cenwalh sent appeals to Agilbert to return to Wessex. < ref name=Ashley304/ >  Agilbert turned Cenwalh down saying his current duties as bishop of Paris prevented his return. < ref name=Bede155 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 155 < /ref >  But he sent his nephew Leutherius in his place. < ref name=Bede155/ >  Leutherius was welcomed in Wessex as the new bishop of Winchester. Agilbert died sometime after 679. He was buried at the monastery of Jouarre. < ref name=Farmer6/ >
