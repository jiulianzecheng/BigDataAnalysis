 '''Suffrage''' is the [[civil and political rights|right]] to [[Voting|vote]]. Most countries allow [[citizen]]s to vote once they are legally an adult. In the past not all people were allowed to vote. In general, most countries today do not stop people of a different race or sex from voting.  
 
 Suffrage can also apply to states themselves. [[United_States_Constitution#Process_of_amendment|Article V. of the U. S. Constitution]] does not allow any [[amendment]] to take away the [[State]]s' equal suffrage in the [[Senate]]. 
 
 Suffrage can also mean the right to be a public [[official]]. Some people call the right to run for office '''candidate eligibility.'''  '''Full suffrage''' means both the right to vote and the right to seek office.
