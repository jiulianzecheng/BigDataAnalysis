 '''Emberizidae''' is a large [[family (biology)|family]] of [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, which are typically known as '''buntings''' in the Old World and '''American sparrows''' in the New World. They are seed-eating birds with a finch-like bill. 
 
 These birds are not closely related to the (Old World) [[sparrow]]s, the family Passeridae. The family also includes the North American birds known as [[junco]]s and [[towhee]]s. 
 
 The Emberizidae family probably originated in [[South America]] and spread first into [[North America]] before crossing into eastern [[Asia]] and continuing to move west. This explains the comparative paucity of emberizid species in [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] when compared to the [[Americas]]. 
 
 Like wih several other [[passerine]] families, this family's [[taxonomy]] is in a state of flux. Many [[genera]] in South and Central America are more closely related to [[tanager]] [[clades]], < ref > Burns K.J; Hackett S.J.  &  Klein N.K. 2002.
