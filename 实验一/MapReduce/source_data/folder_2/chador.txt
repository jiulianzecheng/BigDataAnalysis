 A '''chador''' ([[Persian language|Persian]] چادر) is a piece of [[clothing]]. It is for Muslim women. In [[Iran]], women wear  a chador in public. The Chador covers all the body except the face. However some religious women, cover their faces with their chador too. 
 
 A chador is a full-length semi-circle of [[Textile|fabric]] open down the front.  It is thrown over the head and held shut in front. A chador has no hand openings or closures but is held shut by the hands or by wrapping the ends around the [[waist]].
