 The '''pancreas''' is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that makes [[hormone]]s and [[enzymes]] to help [[digestion]]. The pancreas helps break down [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[protein]]s. The pancreas is behind the [[stomach]] and is on the left side of the [[human body]]. 
 
 The part of the pancreas that makes hormones is called the [[Islets of Langerhans]]. The Islets of Langerhans are a small part (2%) of the total [[cell]]s in the pancreas.  The Islets of Langerhans change which [[chemical]] they make depending on how much of other chemicals are already in the [[blood]].  So, the pancreas works to keep the level of chemicals in balance in the body.  If the Islets of Langerhans stop working, a person will suffer from a [[disease]] called [[diabetes]]. Doctors are [[experiment]]ing with taking the Islets of Langerhans cells from a donor body and putting them into the pancreas of a person with diabetes to make that person well. < ref name= " pmid18081223 " > {{Cite journal

 The pancreas belongs to two systems of the body: the [[digestive system]] for its role in breaking down nutrients, and the [[endocrine system]] for producing hormones. 
 
 == Hormones == 
 The pancreas releases these [[hormones]]: 
 * [[Insulin]] (''which decreases the amount of [[glucose]] or sugar in the blood'') 
 * [[Glucagon]] (''which increases the amount of glucose in the blood'') 
 * [[Somatostatin]] (''which reduces production of insulin and glucagon'') 
 
 == Digestive enzymes == 
 The pancreas releases many different [[enzymes]] to help digestion: 
 * [[Lipase]] (''which breaks down fats'') 
 * [[Amylase]] (''which breaks down carbohydrates'') 
 * [[Trypsinogen]] and [[Chymotrypsin]] (''which break down [[proteins]]'') 
 * [[Erepsin]], which digests [[peptones]] into [[amino acid]]s.
