 A '''Stradivarius''' is a [[string instrument]] (such as a [[violin]]) built by the [[17th century]]  [[Italy|Italian]] [[luthier]] Stradivari family (especially by [[Antonio Stradivari]]) that was famous for making them. Stradivarii are known for their high quality sound and ability to last a long time without tuning. Most of these instruments survive to this day, though few have been stolen. They are some of the best and most expensive instruments, and even each string instrument created has a name. So many people have wanted Stradivarii, and some have sold for more than a million dollars. Famous violinists, such as [[Midori Goto]] or [[Joshua Bell]] have Stradivarii.
