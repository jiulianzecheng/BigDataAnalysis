 '''Gera''' is a city in the east of [[Germany]], in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Thuringia]]. 
 
 It has about 100,000 [[inhabitant]]s. 
 
 == History == 
 In the beginning,  " Gera "  was not the name of a village or city, but of a region or district. This district was mentioned in a document for the first time in the year 995. Four years later, in 999, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] gave this district to his sister Adelheid, who was an [[abbess]] in [[Quedlinburg]]. 
 
 In the center of this area, the  " provincia Gera " , a town with the same name was established. Another document, which is from the year 1237, said for the first time that there was a town called Gera. In this town, the abbesses of Quedlinburg had some officials which were called the ''[[Vogt|Vögte]]'' of Gera. These officials were the ancestors of the [[count]]s and [[prince]]s of [[Reuß]], which reigned in Gera for many years, until the year 1918. 
 
 In the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], Gera was famous for making [[textile]]s. There were some fires in which a lot of the town was destroyed, for example in 1686 and in 1780. In 1806, [[Napoleon]] was in Gera before the [[Battle of Jena]]. 
 
 In the [[19th century]], Gera became an important city of [[industry]]. Before that, Gera was a quite small town, but in the year 1900, it had already about 45,000 inhabitants. 
 
 In 1920, Thuringia was founded as a state of the [[Weimar Republic]]. Gera was the biggest city of the state, because [[Erfurt]] was not yet a part of Thuringia. At the end of [[World War II]], some parts of Gera were destroyed by [[bombs]], for example the Osterstein Castle. 
 
 After World War II, Gera was in the [[Soviet Occupation Zone]] and then in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). From 1952 to 1990, it was the capital of the Gera District (''Bezirk Gera'') of the GDR. 
 
 Since the [[German Reunification]] in 1990, Gera belongs to the Free State of Thuringia in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
 
 == Population == 
 Since 1959, Gera has had more than 100,000 inhabitants. The highest number of inhabitants of Gera was 134,834 in the year 1988. Since the German Reunification, the number of inhabitants becomes smaller and smaller. Now there are fewer people who live in Gera than in [[Jena]], so Gera is only the third-biggest city in Thuringia. On 31 December 2008, there were only 100,643 people living in Gera.
