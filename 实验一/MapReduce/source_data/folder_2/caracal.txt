 The '''caracal''' (''Caracal caracal''), also called '''Persian lynx''' or '''African lynx''', is a [[Felidae|wild cat]]. Caracals are similar to [[lynx]]es, but are more related to the [[serval]]. Caracals are the fastest of the small cats. 
 
 == Look == 
 The Caracal is 65 [[centimetre|cm]] in length (about 2 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]]), plus 30 & nbsp;cm [[tail]] (about 1 foot). It has longer [[leg]]s and a look very similar to a lynx. The colour of its [[fur]] may be [[wine]]-[[red]], [[grey]], [[black]], or [[sand]]-coloured (a type of [[yellow]]). Young caracals have red spots on the fur, but the only markings adults have are black spots above the [[eye]]s. A special part of the caracal body are its long black [[ear]]s - the word  " caracal "  come from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''karakulak'' ( " black ear " ). Their ears are controlled by 20 different [[muscle]]s, to help them find the animals they hunt. 
 
 == Life == 
 [[File:Lightmatter caracal.jpg|thumb|A caracal in the [[San Diego]] [[Zoo]]]] 
 
 Caracals live in [[Africa]] and [[Western Asia]]. Their [[habitat]] is dry steppes (areas without [[tree]]s, covered with [[grass]] or [[shrub]]s) and semi-[[desert]]s, but also can live in places similar to [[woodland]]s, [[savanna]]s, and [[scrub]] [[forest]]s. They live alone or with a mate in a [[territory]]. 
 
 A caracal may live without drinking for a long time - they get the [[water]] from the body of the animals they eat. It hunts at night (but in [[winter]] they also hunt in the daytime) for [[rodent]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[hare]]s. It is not usual, but sometimes they hunt small [[antelope]]s or young [[ostrich]]es. They prefer to eat only the external [[meat]] of the mammals they hunt, and do not eat the internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and they also do not like eating fur. But they eat the [[feather]]s of small birds and rotten [[meat]]. 
 
 They can hunt birds very well; a caracal is able to snatch a bird in [[flight]], sometimes more than one at a time. Caracals can jump and climb every well, which enables them to catch [[hyrax]]es better than any other [[carnivore]]. 
 
 == Caracals and humans == 
 Because they can learn tricks and get accustomed to live with humans, caracals are sometimes kept as pets (especially in the [[United States]] and some [[Europe]]an countries). Farmers in Africa do not like them, because sometimes they enter in [[farm]]s and eat [[chicken]]s and other animals. So they make their dog chase the caracal. 
 
 It is not easy to see caracals in nature because they hide very well. Drivers in [[country|countries]] where caracals live, for example, [[Kenya]] and [[Botswana]], see many [[animal]]s next to [[road]]s, but it is very rare a sighting of a caracal.
