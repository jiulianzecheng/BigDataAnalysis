 '''Crucifixion''' is a way to [[Execution|execute]] (kill) someone, usually because they have committed a [[crime]]. It was used as a [[capital punishment]] by the [[government]] of [[Rome]]. A [[prisoner]] was beaten with whips, and made to carry their own [[cross]]. They were either tied or nailed to the cross. The Romans used different types of crosses: T-shaped, X-shaped, and sometimes just trees. It killed people by making them bleed, go into shock, and making it hard for them to breathe, eventually dying of [[suffocation]]. Some of the people would live for several days before dying. The Roman [[soldier]]s (which were like the [[police]] of that time) would often break the legs of the [[criminal]] to speed it up.

 The most [[famous]] person to have been crucified was [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Son of God]] according to the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion. He was crucified along with two thieves. < ref > {{bibleverse||Luke|23:32}} < /ref > < ref name=ABF > {{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=978-1603207782|pages=50, 73}} < /ref >  The cross later became a symbol of Christianity. Six of the [[twelve apostles]] of Jesus were also crucified later on, but most of them asked to be crucified in a different way from Jesus. For example, [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] (who later became the [[patron saint]] of [[Scotland]]) was crucified on an X-shaped cross. In the year 337 AD, Emperor [[Constantine|Constantine I]] abolished crucifixion in the [[Roman Empire]].
