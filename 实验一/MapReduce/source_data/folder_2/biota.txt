A '''biota''' is a term used for all the living things at a certain time at a certain place. Examples of biota include [[Cambrian]] biota and [[Madagascar|Madagascan]] biota. Because it includes all the living members of a given [[environment]], the term is used especially in [[ecology]]. A similar term is [[biome]], which is used to refer to [[geographical]] regions and [[environment]]s. [[Tundra]], for example, is a biome. 
 
 Flora, fauna and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively called biota.
