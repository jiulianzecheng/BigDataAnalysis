 [[File:Masterpadlock.jpg|thumb|right|A keyless combination padlock. The dial is rotated to three numbers to open the lock.]] 
 A '''padlock''' is a type of portable [[lock]] that has a U-shaped [[shackle]] that will not come apart from the body of the lock unless the correct [[key]] is inserted or the correct combination is dialed. The U-shape of the lock allows for a wide variety of uses. Typically the padlock is used to lock two things together, for example, a [[door]] and its frame, two or more [[chain]]s, or a chain and a fixed object. Padlocks are not recommended for high-security applications because the shackle is easily cut with a [[bolt cutter]] or [[hacksaw]]. Some newer padlocks have hardened [[boron]] [[alloy]] shackles or shrouded (hidden or covered) shackles to make them more difficult to cut. 
 
 ==Construction== 
 The combination padlock is usually made with a metal  " can "  with three tumblers inside connected to a dial on the front. The mechanism is very similar to [[combination lock]] < nowiki/ > s used in [[safe (container)|safes]]. When the correct combination is entered, the notches on the tumblers line up and allow a [[latch]] to fall into the notches, releasing the shackle. Combination locks of this type are not recommended for outdoor use because they can fill up with [[rain]] water which causes them to [[rust]].   
 
 Some padlocks have a laminated body, constructed from a series of metal plates that are riveted together.  
 
 The shackle of most padlocks is made from [[Heat treating|hardened]] steel, although more expensive padlocks may have boron alloy steels to make them more difficult to cut. Inexpensive padlocks usually have a shackle made of ordinary [[steel]]. Corrosion-resistant padlocks usually have a [[brass]] or [[stainless steel]] shackle although these materials have low hardness and are easily cut with bolt-cutters. The material that the shackle is made of is usually stamped in the center of the shackle. For example, a hardened steel shackle will be stamped  " HARDENED "  or a boron alloy shackle will be stamped  " BORON ALLOY " . Alloy steels with appropriate heat treating provide much higher cutting resistance to bolt-cutters.  Alloy steel shackles are plated with another metal such as [[nickel]] or [[Chromium|chrome]] to protect them from [[rust]]. The body of the padlock is usually also plated. Brass and stainless steel padlocks do not need plating, although they are sometimes plated anyway for appearance. 
 
 ==Stamp on shackle== 
 The stamp on the shackle indicates what material it is made of. The most common are: 
 * Hardened - Hardened steel, most common 
 * Case hard - Also hardened steel, found on older padlocks 
 * Stainless - [[Stainless steel]] 
 * Boron alloy - [[Boron]] alloy steel 
 * [[Boron carbide]] - Found on Master Lock Magnum. 
 * Special alloy - Found on some Abus padlocks 
 * [[Molybdenum]] - Molybdenum alloy steel 
 * Unstamped - Normal steel (when silver) or [[brass]] (when gold)
