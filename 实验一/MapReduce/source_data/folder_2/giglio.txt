 '''Giglio Island''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Isola del Giglio'') is an [[island]] and [[Italy|Italian]] ''[[commune]]'' located in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], off the coast of [[Tuscany]], part of the [[Province of Grosseto]], and part of [[Tuscan Archipelago]] 
 
 == Geography == 
 The island is separated by a 16 & nbsp;km stretch of sea from the [[Argentario]] promontory: mainly mountainous, it is almost all [[granite]] with the highest point the Poggio della Pagana (496 m). 90% of its surface is covered by Mediterranean vegetation alternating with large pine forests and numerous vineyards which enable the production of the famous  " Ansonaco "  wine. The coast is 27 & nbsp;km long, made up of rocks, of smooth cliffs and several bays: Arenella, Cannelle, Caldane and Campese, the biggest one with its little village of the same name.

 == History == 
 The modern island was probably born 4.5 - 5 millions years ago, and people have lived there since the [[Iron Age]]. Later it was probably an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] military stronghold. Under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] it was an important base in the Tyrrhenian Sea, written about, for example, by [[Julius Caesar]] in his ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' and by the poet [[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus]]. 
 
 In 805 it was given by [[Charlemagne]] to the [[abbey]] of the Tre Fontane in Rome, and was later a possession of [[Aldobrandeschi]], [[Pannocchieschi]], [[Caetani]], [[Orsini]] families and the town of [[Perugia]]. In [[1241]] the Sicilian fleet of Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] destroyed a Genoese fleet. From 1264 Giglio was a [[Pisa]]ne dominion, from which it passed to the Medici. It suffered several Saracen attacks, which ended only in 1799. 
 
 Alongside its history the island was always renowned for its mineral resources: many columns and edifices in Rome were built with the Gigliese [[granite]]. 
 
 == How the island was == 
 The island has the remains of a Roman villa of Domitius [[Ahenobarbus]] (1st-2nd centuries), in the area of Giglio Porto. No traces of the Temple of [[Diana]] once existing now can be seen. The church of San Pietro Apostolo in Giglio Castello has an ivory crucifix believed to be by [[Giambologna]] 
 
 It is also site of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[shipwreck]], dating to the early [[Iron Age]], ''c.'' 600 BC. The cargo of the ship included [[copper]] and [[lead]] ingots, [[iron]] spits, [[amphora]]e and a [[Corinth]]ian helmet. Even a wooden writing tablet with stylus was preserved. The finds are almost completely lost now. 
 
 == Transportation == 
 Isola del Giglio is connected to Tuscany by ferries starting from [[Porto Santo Stefano]] and [[Orbetello|Orbetello Scalo]].
