 A '''criterium''', or '''crit''', is a type of [[Road bicycle racing|bicycle race]] held on a short course (usually less than 5 & nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]), often run on closed-off city centre streets. 
 
 Race length can be either a time or a number of laps. Often a criterium lasts about one hour, which is shorter than that of a traditional road race – which can last many hours, sometimes of several days or even weeks, as in a [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]]. However, the average speed and is much higher. The winner is the first rider to cross the finish line without having been  " lapped "  (overtaken). 
 
 Events often have prizes (called ''primes'', usually cash) for winning specific intermediate laps (for instance, every 10th lap). 
 
 Winning criteriums needs a mix of good technical skills – especially the ability to corner rapidly and sharply – and riding safely with a large group on a short circuit and exceptional fitness to attack other riders and repeatedly accelerate hard from corners. 
 
 Criteriums are relatively easy to organize and do not require a large amount of space. They are the most common type of bicycle racing in the continental United States. 
 
 ==Equipment== 
 
 [[Racing bicycle]]s used for criteriums are typically no different than those used in other mass-start road events. However, some racers use shorter bicycles to help keep control when turning  and slightly shorter [[crankset|cranks]] (pedal levers) to help pedalling through sharp turns.
