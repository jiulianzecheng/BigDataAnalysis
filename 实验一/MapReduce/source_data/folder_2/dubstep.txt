 '''Dubstep''' (also known as '''dubstep remix''' or '''remix dubstep''') is a [[genre]] of music that started in South [[London]], it drew influence from 2-step garage, dub, [[drum and bass]], grime and reggae. A popular [[dubstep]] producer Skrillex changed the genre into something much heavier with more growls, gritty basslines and fat sub-basses.  
 
 Since then, the dubstep scene has changed a lot with dubstep going from the underground genre that it was to a mainstream one. It has been played on big festivals, like Ultra Music Festival and Lost Lands. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 
 Dubstep is usually [[instrumental]]. Its [[tempo]] usually ranges between 138 to 150 beats per minute. Many songs have two bass drops, where a switch of rhythm and/or bass line occurs and usually follows a recognizable build section and break. 
 
 A style of Americanized, heavier and aggressive form of dubstep is referred to as brostep, which has become very popular. It was started by Skrillex..
