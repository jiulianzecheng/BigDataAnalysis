 '''Parthia''' was an ancient [[Iranian people|Parthian]] empire in [[Asia]]. It included what is now [[Iran]], part of [[Armenia]], [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], eastern [[Turkey]], eastern [[Syria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kuwait]], the [[Persian Gulf]] coast of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. 
 
 Parthians were excellent horsemen and [[Archery|archers]]. In battle, mounted Parthians often discharged their arrows back towards the enemy and pretended to flee. 
 
 In 250 BC, the Parthians succeeded in founding an independent kingdom, which in the 1st century BC grew into an empire extending from the [[Euphrates]] to the [[Indus River|Indus]] and from the [[Amu Darya]] to the [[Indian Ocean]]. They expanded by successfully expelling the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] from [[Iran|Persia]] and establishing the second freat Persian Empire.
