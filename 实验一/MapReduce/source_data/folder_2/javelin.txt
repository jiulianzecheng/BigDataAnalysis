 A '''javelin''' is a light [[spear]] designed to be thrown. Historically it was a weapon, but from the Ancient Greeks to today it is used for sport. The javelin is almost always thrown by hand. 
 
 The javelin throw is a [[sport]]s event, one of the [[field event]]s which survive from the original Olympic Games. The [[Sportsperson|athlete]] holds the javelin in one hand and, while running, throws it as far as possible. It is an official [[Olympic]] sport. < ref > The Ancient Olympic Games by Judith Swaddling < /ref > 
 
 Unlike other throwing events, javelin allows the competitor to build speed over a considerable distance.
