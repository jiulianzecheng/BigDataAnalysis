In [[law enforcement]] and criminology '''booking''' refers to the intake process of admitting an arrestee or convict into a [[prison]] or [[police station]]. In the [[United States]] and United Kingdom, this process involves being [[fingerprint]]ed, [[photograph]]ed (having a [[mugshot]] taken), and having one's possessions confiscated. What an arrestee is allowed to keep in their possession varies depending on the exact facility, [[county]], etc, inmates are usually allowed to keep prescription [[glasses]] with no [[tint]] on the lenses, [[hearing aid]]s and other approved medical devices, their legal papers and a few other things. In the United States, if an arrestee can't [[bail]] out of jail, or they're beginning a prison term, they're issued a [[prison uniform]] and other jail issued items and informed of the facility's rules and regulations. 
 
 Booking also means making an [[appointment]] of some kind.
