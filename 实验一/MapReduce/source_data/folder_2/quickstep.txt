The '''Quickstep''' is an International Style [[ballroom dance]] that follows a 4/4  time beat, at about 50 bars per minute. < ref name=VS > Silvester, Victor 1982. ''Modern ballroom dancing: history and practice''. Paul, London. < /ref > < sup > p62 < /sup >  From its early beginning as a faster [[Foxtrot]], the Quickstep has become quite different. It is danced to the fastest tempo of the ballroom dances. 
 
 The Quickstep developed in the 1920s from a combination of the Foxtrot, the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]], and other dances. The dance is English in origin, and was [[standard]]ized in 1927. Although it came from the Foxtrot, the Quickstep now is quite separate. Unlike the modern Foxtrot, the feet often close and [[Syncopation|syncopated]] (split-beat) steps occur often. Three characteristic dance figures of the Quickstep are the ''chass√©s'', where the feet come together, the ''quarter turns'', and the ''lock step''. < ref name=VS/ > < sup > p126 < /sup > 
 
 This dance became a very dynamic one with a lot of movement on the dance floor, with many advanced patterns including [[hop]]s, runs, quick steps with a lot of [[momentum]], and [[rotation]]. The tempo of Quickstep dance is rather brisk as it was developed to [[ragtime]] era [[jazz]] music which was fast-paced compared to other dance music. 
 
 Today the complexity of Quickstep as done by [[competition]] dancers has increased. They use more syncopated steps. While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with  " quick "  (one beat) and  " slow "  (two beats) steps, many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats, such as  " quick-and-quick-and-quick, quick, slow " , with there being further steps on the 'and's.
