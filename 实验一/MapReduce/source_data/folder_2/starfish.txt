 '''Starfish''', or '''sea stars''', are [[Echinoderm]]s of the [[Class (biology)|Class]] [[Asteroidea]]. < ref name= " Nichols " / > < sup > p35 < /sup > 
 
 All live in the [[ocean]], on the sea floor. Many starfish live in deep water, others in shallow water. Some live in the [[intertidal zone]], between [[low tide|low]] and [[high tide]]. < ref > At low tide they would be in [[rock pool]]s. < /ref >  They have five or more [[arm]]s and can be quite large. The Sunflower sea star (''Pycnopodia helianthoides'') is the largest: fully grown, its arm-span is about a metre. This is a bit larger than the famous [[Crown-of-thorns starfish]], which lives on [[coral]] [[polyp]]s. 
 
 Although starfish are [[invertebrate]]s, they do have a kind of [[skeleton]]. The bodies of starfish are composed of [[calcium carbonate]] plates, known as 'ossicles'. These form the [[endoskeleton]], which takes on a variety of forms such as spines and granules. 
 
 They have a primitive [[nervous system]], but not a [[brain]]. They also do not have [[blood]], instead they use [[salt water|sea water]] to pump things around their bodies. 
 
 There are over 1500 different species of sea star. Most sea stars are [[predator]]s. They eat [[mussel]]s, [[clam]]s, and other [[bivalve]]s. Occasionally, they catch small [[fish]]. < ref name= " sweet2005 " > {{cite web |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Fossilgroups/asteroz2/index_f/mod_fm.html |title=Asterozoa: Fossil groups: SciComms 05-06: Earth Sciences |accessdate=2008-05-07 |last=Sweet |first=Elizabeth |date=2005-11-22 |archive-date=2007-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073619/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Fossilgroups/asteroz2/index_f/mod_fm.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " Nichols " / > 
 
 == Symmetry == 
 Most starfish have five arms, called ''rays'' that come out from a center circle (disk). If a starfish has more than five rays, it will often have rays in [[wikt:multiple|multiples]] of five; there could be 10, 15, 20, or even 30 rays on one starfish. This is called pentameral (five-fold) [[symmetry]]. 
 
 == Skeleton == 
 The degree of protection offered by the skeleton differs between species. If the skeleton becomes more rigid, it offers better protection against [[predator]]s. However, this will tend to limit its feeding alternatives. Great flexibility is required for the process of external digestion used by many species to eat [[bivalve]]s. The less well [[armour]]ed species may adopt a life in places where they are not so open to predation. The heavily armoured ones can tough it out in the most competitive [[habitat]]s: 
 : " A heavily calcified sturdy skeleton capable of resisting both large and small predators has evolved in many tropical sea stars... a very firm body wall... still permits a degree of flexibility of the body and arms " . < ref > Blake D.B. 1984. Constructional morphology and life habits of the Jurassic sea star ''Sphaeroaster'' Quenstadt. ''Neues Jb. Geol. Palãont. Abb''. '''169''', 74–101. < /ref > 
 
 == Feeding == 
 [[File:Asterias rubens (eating).jpg|thumb|right|240px|Eating a [[mussel]]: note the tube feet]] 
 
 === Senses === 
 The movement of starfish is guided by their senses of touch and sight. There are five 'eyes', light-sensitive cushions, one at the end of each arm. These and the tube feet are connected to nerve fibres, so these animals are more complex than might appear. 
 
 === Tube feet === 
 Although starfish started off as filter-feeders, they evolved to become major predators of shell-fish (the [[brachiopod]]s and [[bivalve]]s). They can also eat small [[crustacea]] and fish. Their [[tube feet]] developed suckers, perhaps originally to improve movement. Later, they were used to open shell-fish. 
 : " Suckered tube feet may not have been present in any [[Palaeozoic]] sea star " . < ref > Blake D.B. 1981. The new [[Jurassic]] sea star ''Eokainaster'' and comments on life habit and the origins of modern Asteroidea. ''J. Paleont.'' '''55''', 33–46. < /ref > 
 
 === Feeding methods === 
 The shells of [[brachiopod]]s and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and [[hydraulic]] system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit. Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell. The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm. < ref > Vermeij G.J. 1987. ''Evolution and escalation: an ecological history of life''. Princeton N.J. p153 < /ref >  The starfish then dissolves the [[mollusc]] where it lives, absorbing the [[nutrient]]s. This digestion process takes much longer than opening the shell, perhaps a couple of days. < ref > Jangoux M. and Lawrence J.M. (eds) 1982. ''Echinoderm nutrition''. Balkema, Rotterdam. < /ref > 
 
 Some species swallow the shell whole, and dissolve the contents inside their stomach, then push out the shell afterwards. < ref > Nicholson F.C. ''How a sea star gets its clam''.

 The ability of starfish to eat brachipods and bivalves developed in the [[Mesozoic]], especially in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]]. This was part of the ''Mesozoic marine revolution'', which transformed the sea-floor [[fauna]]. Weakly defended and static shellfish disappeared, and more heavily armoured or more mobile shellfish flourished. < ref name= " Vermeij1977 " > {{cite journal

 == Regeneration == 
 Starfish, like many sea creatures, are able to ''regenerate'' (grow back) parts of their bodies. Starfish are better at [[regeneration]] than most other creatures. Not only can a new ray grow when a ray is torn off, but if the torn off ray has even a small piece of the central disk still attached, a whole new starfish can grow from the one ray. < ref name= " Nichols " / > < sup > p35 < /sup > 
 
 Because starfish like to eat clams and [[oyster]]s, fishermen who gather [[shellfish]] have tried for years to get rid of them. To kill the starfish, fishermen would catch them, slice them right in half, and throw them back in the ocean. However, because starfish can grow back parts of their bodies, they were actually [[wikt:increase|increasing]] the number of starfish.
