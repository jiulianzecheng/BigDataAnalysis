'''Kidsongs''' is an American children's media franchise. It includes Kidsongs Music Video Stories on DVD and video, The Kidsongs TV Show, CDs of favorite children's songs, song books, sheet music, toys and an e-commerce [[website]].  
 
 It was created by producer/writer Carol Rosenstein and director Bruce Gowers of Together Again Video Productions (TAVP), both of whom are music video and television production veterans. They had produced and directed over 100 music videos for Warner Records (WBR) and took their idea of music videos for children to the record label.
