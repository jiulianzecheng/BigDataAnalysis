 An '''aviary''' is a place where [[bird]]s are kept. It is larger than a [[birdcage]]. Some aviaries are large enough for birds to fly some distance. Many [[zoo]]s have aviaries. People who [[breed]] birds to sell also have aviaries. Many aviaries have [[plants]] and other things to imitate [[nature]].
