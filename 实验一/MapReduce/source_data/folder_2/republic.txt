A '''republic''' is a form of [[government]] that has no [[monarchy]] and no hereditary [[aristocracy]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/civ/6a.asp|title=The Roman Republic [ushistory.org]

 National [[sovereignty]] lies in the authority of the government, not in an emperor or monarch. The word ''republic'' comes from the [[Latin]] words '''res publica''',  meaning a  " public thing " . For example, the [[United States]] and [[India]] are republics. However, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]] are not republics since they have a monarch (King Charles III in both cases)  
 
 Countries with a king or other [[monarch]] and free elections is called a [[constitutional monarchy]], not republics. A constitutional monarchy resembles a republic because the constitution has been amended to remove power from the monarch and install institutions conforming to a philosophy of republicanism. That includes the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the [[Netherlands]], [[Thailand]], and countries in [[Scandinavia]] and elsewhere. What makes a republic different is that its laws are made and enforced without royal authority. 
 
 The [[head of state]] in a republic is generally a person who has been chosen by the [[citizen]]s by [[direct election]] or by a group of elected representatives to act as the top representative of the people. In most republics, the head of state is called the [[president]]. In some countries, the president is elected and has a lot of political power. In others, the president does not hold much direct power but is important in the legal system for other reasons. 
 
 Sometimes, state is called a  " republic "  when its head is not called a  " king " . For example, the [[Roman Empire]] had an  " emperor "  and the [[Dutch Republic]] had a  " stadholder " , but they worked as [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchs]]. 
 
 [[Licchavi]], in [[India]], was an aristocratic state in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and is nowadays sometimes called the first republic. The earliest republics that were much imitated later were [[Classical Greece|Greek]] cities, for example [[democracy in Athens]]. The biggest difference from the other [[polis|city-states]] was that people chose their leaders by [[voting]] or by [[lottery]]. Several Italian city-states during the [[Renaissance]] were ruled by a small group of aristocrats, and were called republics.
