 '''Astrocytes'''  < ref > Astro from Greek ''astron'' = star and ''cyte'' from Greek  " kyttaron "  = cell < /ref >  are characteristic star-shaped [[neuroglia|glial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. They are also known collectively as '''astroglia'''. 
 
 The proportion of astrocytes in the brain varies. Studies have found that the astrocyte proportion varies by region from 20% to 40% of all [[glia]]. < ref > {{cite book | author = Verkhratsky A.  &  Butt A.M. 2013. | title=Glial physiology and pathophysiology | date=15 April 2013 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons |section=Numbers: how many glial cells are in the brain? |pages= 93–96| isbn= 978-0-470-97853-5}} < /ref >   
 
 Astrocytes do many things. They help the [[endothelium|endothelial cell]]s of the [[blood–brain barrier]], provide [[nutrients]] to the nervous tissue, keep extracellular [[ion]]s in balance. They also help repair the brain and [[spinal cord]] after traumatic injuries. 
 
 Research since the mid-1990s has shown that astrocytes release [[calcium|Ca < sup > 2+ < /sup > ]] ions, and adjust brain functions. < ref name= " pmid18834310 " > {{cite journal |author=Fiacco TA, Agulhon C, McCarthy KD |title=Sorting out astrocyte physiology from pharmacology |journal=Ann.
