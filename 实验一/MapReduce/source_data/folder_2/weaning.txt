'''Weaning''' means changing the [[diet]] of a [[baby]] little by little, from its [[Breastfeeding|mother's milk]] to the food it will eat as an [[adult]].  Since only female [[mammal]]s make milk, weaning is only a necessary process for mammals.  When a baby does not drink any more breast milk (or milk substitute), the baby has been weaned. 
 
 ==Human weaning== 
 Babies are able to eat small amounts of solid food, along with breast milk or formula, when they are about six months old.  Before this time, a child's [[digestion|digestive system]] and [[kidney]]s are still forming, so the child is not ready for solid food. 
 
 Babies do not have [[tooth|teeth]] and cannot chew their food, so they are usually fed soft, runny food such as cooked mashed [[fruit]] or [[vegetable]]s.  Babies cannot digest some foods which adults can eat, including food with [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s or with large amounts of [[gluten]], [[salt]] or [[sugar]].  Also, babies' digestive systems are very sensitive to [[bacteria]], so they should not eat any foods with [[honey]], [[egg (food)|egg]]s or [[shellfish]] in them because these foods sometimes contain bacteria. < ref > [http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/birthtofive/Pages/Weaningfirststeps.aspx  " Solids: the first steps, " ] NHS Choices website, 29 July 2009. < /ref > 
 
 ==Weaning== 
 Weaning conflict happens when the mother wants to wean her baby, but the baby wants to keep [[breastfeeding]]. < ref name=salmon > Salmon, C.  &  Shackelford, T.K. (2008). ''Family Relationships: An Evolutionary Perspective''. Oxford University Press. pp. 148–149. {{ISBN|9780195320510}}. < /ref >  The mother tries to force the baby to stop breastfeeding, and the baby tries to force the mother to continue.  Some [[Evolution|evolutionary scientists]] think mammal mothers need to wean their babies as soon as possible, so they will have a greater chance of having more babies and spreading their [[gene]]s.  But mammal babies want to breastfeed as long as they can so they will have a chance to grow strong, and also to enjoy the full care of their mothers. < ref name=salmon / > < ref > [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~phyl/anthro/conflict.html  " Parent-Offspring Conflict in Primates, " ] Anthropology 368 course, University of Michigan, April 1997. < /ref >   Weaning conflict happens in several mammal [[species]], including [[primate]]s and [[canine]]s. < ref > Trivers, Robert (2002).
