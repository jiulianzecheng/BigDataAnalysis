 '''Polychaetes''', or '''bristle worms''', are a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[annelid]] worms. 
 
 They are generally found in a [[Ocean|marine]] [[environment]]. There are more than 10,000 known [[species]] in this class. They are ancient animals, dating back to 518 million years ago. They are first found in the early [[Cambrian]] fossil beds of [[Sirius Passet]] in [[Greenland]]. < ref > Morris S.C.  &  Peel J. S. 2008. The earliest annelids: Lower Cambrian polychaetes from the Sirius Passet lagerstätte, Peary Land, North Greenland. ''Acta Palaeontologica Polonica'' '''53''': 137. [http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app53-137.html] < /ref > 
 
 Each of their body [[segment]]s has some fleshy protrusions that stand out. These 'parapodia' have many [[bristle]]s, which are made of [[chitin]]. This is different from the [[Oligochaeta]], which are similar in form, but only have a few bristles. 
 
 Common species are the [[lugworm]], and the [[clam worm]] ''[[Nereis]]'' (which is sometimes also called a 'sandworm'). < ref name=Barnes > Barnes, Robert D. 1982. ''Invertebrate zoology''. Philadelphia, PA: Holt-Saunders International. pp. 469–525. {{ISBN|0-03-056747-5}}. < /ref > 
 
 == Description == 
 Polychaetes are segmented worms, generally less than {{convert|10|cm|in}} in length, although ranging at the extremes from {{convert|1|mm|in}} to {{convert|3|m|ft}}. They are often brightly coloured, and may be [[Iridescence|iridescent]] or even [[Bioluminescence|luminescent]]. 
 
 Each segment bears a pair of paddle-like parapodia, which are used for movement. In many species, the parapodia, well supplied with blood vessels, act as the worm's primary [[respiration|respiratory]] surfaces. Bundles of bristles  stick out from the parapodia. < ref name=Barnes/ > 
 
 Some bristle worms have poison bristles. The bristles will break off in the skin of a predator that tries to pick up the animal and sting the predator painfully. < ref > James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. 2006.

 The head, or [[prostomium]], is relatively well developed, compared with other annelids. It is forward over the mouth, which lies on the animal's underside. The head normally includes two to four pair of eyes, although there are some blind species. These eyes are fairly simple structures, capable of distinguishing between light and dark. Some species have large eyes with lenses that may be capable of real vision. < ref name=Barnes/ > 
 
 The head also includes a pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], tentacle-like [[palp]]s, and a pair of pits lined with [[cilia]], known as  " nuchal organs " . These latter appear to be [[chemoreceptor]]s which help the worm seek out food. < ref name=Barnes/ > 
 
 == Ecology == 
 Polychaetes vary in form and [[lifestyle]]. Most [[burrow]] or build tubes in the [[sediment]], some swim among the [[plankton]], and some live as [[commensalism|commensals]]. A few are [[parasitism|parasitic]]. 
 
 The mobile forms tend to have well-developed sense organs and jaws, while the stationary forms lack them, but may have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration and deposit or filter feeding, e.g., [[fanworm]]s. 
 
 A few groups have evolved to live in terrestrial environments, but are restricted to humid areas. Some have even evolved tubes that open inwards from the skin which work like simple lungs, absorbing oxygen from the air and allowing release of waste gases. 
 
 ;Notable polychaetes 
 * One notable polychaete, the [[Pompeii worm]] (''Alvinella pompejana'') is endemic to the [[hydrothermal vent]]s of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Pompeii worms are among the most heat-tolerant [[metazoa]]n animals known. 
 * A recently discovered genus, ''[[Osedax]]'', includes a species nicknamed the  " bone-eating snot flower " . < ref name= " BBCNews_Science & Environment_18Oct2005_Osedaxspp " > {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4354286.stm|title='Zombie worms' found off Sweden |date=18 October 2005|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 February 2010}} < /ref > 
 * Another remarkable polychaete is ''[[Hesiocaeca methanicola]]'', which lives on [[methane clathrate]] deposits. 
 * ''[[Lamellibrachia]] luymesi'' is a cold seep tube worm which reaches lengths of over 3 meters, and may be the most long-lived animal at over 250 years old. 
 * A still unclassified multi-legged predatory polychaete worm was identified only by observation from the underwater vehicle ''Nereus'' at the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]], the greatest depth in the oceans, near 10,902 m (35,768 & nbsp;ft) depth. It was about an inch long visually, but the probe failed to capture it, so it could not be studied in detail. < ref > [http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html Accessed Oct. 8, 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961027163532/http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html |date=1996-10-27 }} Geography of the ocean floor near Guam with some notes on exploration of the Challenger Deep. < /ref > 
 * [[Eunice aphroditois]] is a [[sea-floor]] [[predator]] which catches and eats fish bigger than itself. 
 
 == Bristle worm diet == 
 Most bristle worms are [[scavenger]]s, but some are good [[predator]]s, eating [[fish]]es and [[coral]]. Others like to eat [[algae]]. They are usually found hiding in [[reef]]s and rocky places. They crawl along the sea floor or the bottom of a tide pool, looking for something to eat. < ref name=Barnes/ >
