 '''Autobahn''' (German, word translation ''car [rail] way'') is the [[controlled-access highway]] system in [[Germany]]. < ref name= " iamexpat " / > 
 They are famous because if there is no [[speed limit]] shown with [[Traffic sign|road signs]], drivers can drive as fast as they want to if following the general [[w: duty of care|rule of due care]]. About 30 % of all autobahn sections have a speed limit. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Infografik: 70 Prozent der deutschen Autobahnen ohne Tempolimit|url=https://de.statista.com/infografik/16725/tempolimitregelungen-auf-bundesautobahnen/|access-date=2023-01-09|website=Statista Infografiken|language=de}} < /ref > 
 
 == Design == 
 An autobahn is designed for fast [[travel]]. 
 Curves are very large. 
 Slopes are not too steep. 
 There are many [[tunnel]]s and [[bridge]]s to avoid curves and big slopes. 
 The street surface is solid. 
 There are no [[traffic light]]s or (same-height) [[Intersection (road)|intersections]]. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > 
 
 === Main road === 
 Except for ramps, an autobahn has at least [[Dual carriageway|two]] [[lane]]s in each direction. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 Each direction is separated by a median strip. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 The median strip usually has a metal barrier. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 There are small plants like bushes. 
 This blocks lights of cars driving in opposite direction. 
 Sometimes there is a {{lang-de|Blendschutzzaun|lit=dazzle protection [[fence]]|label=none}}, instead. 
 
 Near cities or in other high-traffic areas, there may be more than two lanes for one direction. < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 Except for very few low-traffic areas, an autobahn has one additional lane that is not for moving traffic, but for vehicles having mechanical failures ({{lang-de|Standstreifen|lit=stand strip}}). < ref name= " simplegermany " / > < ref name= " handbook " / > < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 Except for some city autobahns, there are no [[streetlight]]s. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > 
 
 [[File:Hectoreflecto D 26k346.jpg|thumb|Triangle with phone symbol on reflector post shows emergency telephone is less than 1 & nbsp;km to the left.]] 
 === Other things === 
 At a German autobahn, every {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}} there is an [[emergency telephone]]. < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 The direction of the closest emergency phone is shown by a triangle on the reflector posts. < ref name= " usembassy " / > < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 
 Junctions between two autobahns are called 
 * {{lang-de|Dreieck|lit=Triangle|label=none}} if one autobahn ends there or 
 * {{lang-de|Kreuz|lit=Cross|label=none}}, an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]]. 
 Junctions with normal [[road]]s are called {{lang-de|Anschlußstelle|lit=connection point|label=none}}. 
 On the autobahn the traffic sign reads {{lang-de|Ausfahrt|lit=exit|label=none}}. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > 
 All junctions of an autobahn are numbered sequentially. 
 Junctions that were build after the autobahn was completed may have one letter, too. 
 This prevents giving all other junctions new numbers. 
 
 All autobahns have rest stops. < ref name= " iamexpat " / > 
 These are [[parking lot]]s. 
 Most parking lots also have big space for [[truck]]s. 
 Occasionally the rest stop has a [[toilet]], too. 
 There are also [[gas station]]s. 
 Frequently, gas station and rest stop are combined, some have a (fast-food) restaurant or even a hotel or church. 
 Both, rest stops and gas stations, can usually ''only'' be accessed from the autobahn, so the area cannot be used as an unofficial {{lang|de|Anschlußstelle}}. 
 
 === Law enforcement === 
 The German autobahn has its own police, the {{lang-de|Autobahnpolizei|lit=highway patrol|label=none}}. < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 They have very fast police cars. 
 There are police stations on the autobahn. 
 
 There are no active border checkpoints anymore. 
 Since the [[Reunification of Germany|reunification of the Germanies]], the [[German Democratic Republic]] and [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the Helmstedt–Marienborn border crossing on the A2 has lost its function. 
 Since the Schengen Agreement there are also no checkpoints to neighboring countries. 
 
 == Rules == 
 === Order === 
 Germany has [[Left- and right-hand traffic|right-hand traffic]]. 
 All drivers are supposed to drive in the outer-most lane. < ref name= " handbook " / > < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 This is the right-most lane. < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 Only for moving past other cars or trucks that are going slower the right-most lane may be left. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 
 === Speed === 
 It is forbidden to stop on an autobahn, unless there is a situation asking for it (for example a [[car crash]]). < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 It is forbidden to [[Parking|park]] on an autobahn. < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 It is forbidden to reverse or turn around, except if the police asks for it. < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 
 Pedestrians < ref name= " handbook " / >  or bicyclists are not allowed on an autobahn. 
 All vehicles must ''by design'' be able to go ''faster than'' {{convert|60|kph|mph|1|abbr=on|lk=on|sp=us}}. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > < ref name= " handbook " / > 
 This is not a minimum speed. 
 If the situation asks for it, for example a traffic jam or whiteout (very strong snow) condition, a slower speed can be driven. 
 
 During the [[1973 oil crisis]] there was a general speed limit of {{convert|100|kph|mph|1|abbr=on|lk=on|sp=us}} in [[West Germany]]. < ref name= " nyt " / > 
 Because of criticism, four months later the speed limit was removed. < ref name= " nyt " / > 
 Today, about 50 to 70% of autobahns in Germany have no speed limit shown by a traffic sign. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > < ref name= " nyt " / > < ref name= " iamexpat " / > 
 There is only a speed ''recommendation'' of {{convert|130|kph|mph|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} per hour. < ref name= " iamexpat " / > < ref name= " simplegermany " / > 
 The traffic law says, drivers must adjust their speed to the road condition and go only as fast as they can safely stop within the area they can see. 
 However, if you are involved in an accident while driving faster 130 km/h, you are automatically attributed contributory [[negligence]] of about 30%. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > 
 
 === Fee === 
 Driving on a German autobahn is free for cars. < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 Since 2005, trucks (12.5 [[ton]]s and above) do have to pay a toll < ref name= " cnntravel " / >  of about a twelve [[Cent (currency)|cents]] (€0.12) per [[kilometer]]. 
 
 [[File:Ampel Sondierungen and FridaysForFuture protest 2021-10-15 165.jpg|thumb|Protest asking for general speed limit.]] 
 == Discussion about general maximum speed == 
 There have been many discussions about introducing a general speed limit on all German roads. < ref name= " cnntravel " / > 
 Some people say it will improve traffic safety. < ref name= " simplegermany " / > 
 The German Road Safety Council (DVR) has found that on average there are 25% more deaths on sections of the autobahn without speed limits compared to those with a limit. 
 Data analysis performed by [[Der Spiegel]] has found that a speed limit applied across all German motorways would save 140 lives a year. < ref name= " etsc " / > 
 
 In Germany, many cars and trucks use an [[internal combustion engine]]. 
 Some people say a maximum speed was necessary because of the environmental pollution.
