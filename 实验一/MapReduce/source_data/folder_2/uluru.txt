 '''Uluru''', also called '''Ayers Rock''', is a name given to a huge rock near [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] in the Australian [[Outback]] and located in [[Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park]]. This is a holy place for some [[Aboriginal Australians]]. It is in the [[Western Desert]], in the middle of Australia. It was listed as a [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage site]] in 1987 because of its geology. < ref name= " whis " > {{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/heritage/index.html|title=World Heritage and International Significance|date=October 2009|work=Uluru and Kata Tjuta National Park|publisher=Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|accessdate=2009-11-06}} < /ref >  In 1997 it was again listed as a World Heritage site, this time because of its importance to the [[Anangu|A < u > n < /u > angu]] people. < ref name= whis/ >  It was the second place in the world to be listed as culturally significant, and it is one of the few places in the world to have two listings. < ref name=whis/ >

 Modern science shows that they have lived around Uluru for more than 40,000 years They continued to live their traditional life until the 1930s. < ref name=hist/ >  This was a [[nomad]]ic life, moving around to hunt and gather food according to the seasons.
