A '''mahasiddha''' (Sanskrit: ''maha'' - great, ''[[siddha]]'' - achiever) is type of [[yogi]] important in [[Tantra]]. They are found in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. They are connected with unusual ways of thinking and with the highest levels of spiritual [[bodhi|enlightenment]].  They are very different from [[arhat]]s, the saints who gave up the world to achieve [[buddhahood]]. 
 
 The Mahasiddhas are actual people who acquired magical powers from their spiritual practice. A mahasiddha is a [[bodhisattva]], someone who can enter ''[[nirvana]]'' whenever they want, but instead choose to stay in ''[[samsara]]'' to help others. 
 
 In both Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions there are '''85 Mahasiddhas'''. The lists are not all the same, but there are many Mahasiddhas who appear on most lists. In [[Tibetan art|Tibetan Buddhist art]], they are often shown in paintings together, for example around the border of a ''[[thanka]]''. 
 
 ==Important Mahasiddhas== 
 Each Mahasiddha has come to be known for certain things.  One of the most loved Mahasiddhas is [[Virupa]], who is a saint of the [[Sakyapa]] sect.  He lived in [[9th century]] [[India]] and was known for his great attainments. Other important Mahasiddhas include: 
 
 *[[Marpa]], the great translator and first native-born [[guru]] in [[Tibet]] who brought [[Buddhist teachings]] from India. 
 *[[Milarepa]], Marpa's student . In Buddhist pictures and statues, Milarepa is shown with his right hand cupped against his ear. He does this to better listen to the teachings ''([[dharma]])''.  
 *[[Karmapa]], the first consciously incarnating [[lama]] of Tibet. 
 *[[Gorakhnath]] 
 *[[Matsyendranath]] 
 *[[Nagarjuna]] 
 *[[Naropa]] 
 *[[Saraha]] 
 *[[Shantideva]] 
 *[[Tilopa]]
