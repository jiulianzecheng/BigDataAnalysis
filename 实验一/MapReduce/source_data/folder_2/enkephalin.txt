An '''enkephalin''' is one of the first [[endorphin]]s that were discovered in the brain. They are found in many parts of the brain, specially in the [[basal ganglia]]. They act as  " natural pain killers " . 
 
 Enkephalins are small [[protein]]s. They consist of five [[amino acid]]s in each of their [[molecule]]s. The last amino acid is either [[leucine]] (leu) or [[methionine]] (met). 
 
 Enkephalin is a brain [[neurotransmitter]] that is formed when tyrocine, glycine, glycine, phenylalanine, and methionine through a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis.
