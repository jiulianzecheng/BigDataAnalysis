[[Image:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|thumb|The vexilloid of the [[Roman Empire]] was emblazoned with initials [[SPQR|S·P·Q·R]] (''senātus populusque Rōmānus''), which in [[Latin]] means  " the senate and the people of Rome " .]] 
 
 A '''vexilloid''' has the same functions as a [[flag]] but it looks different. Vexilloids are characteristic of traditional societies and ancient [[empire]]s (Flags did not come into general use until [[medieval]] times.).  A ''vexilloid'' consists of a staff held upright with a cloth banner that hangs down vertically on the staff and on top of the staff is an [[emblem]], such as a carved animal.
