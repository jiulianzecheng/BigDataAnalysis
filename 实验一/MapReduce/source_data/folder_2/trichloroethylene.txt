'''Trichloroethylene''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the formula {{chem2|C2HCl3}}. It is known as '''TCE''' for short. TCE is pleasant-smelling colourless liquid. TCE is used as a [[solvent]] to dissolve oils. It was previously used in [[anaesthesia]] after [[chloroform]], TCE for use in anaesthesia was dyed blue so it would not be confused with chloroform which smells, weighs and looks the same. It was sold under the name ''Trilene''.

 TCE was a very common [[dry cleaning]] solvent but it was way too strong and caused damage to clothes. Dry cleaners today use the safer [[perchloroethylene]] (PCE). TCE is still sometimes used as a stain remover. 
 
 TCE is used as a solvent to clean oils from metals but it can break down in presence of metals so producers add various chemicals into commercial TCE to prevent any unwanted reactions. 
 
 Breathing trichloroethylene vapours can cause unconsciousness. It should be used in well-ventilated places. Its effects are similar to being drunk with alcohol. It can harm the liver in long time.
