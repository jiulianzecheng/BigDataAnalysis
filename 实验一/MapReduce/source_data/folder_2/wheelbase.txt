 In both road and rail [[vehicle]]s, the '''wheelbase''' is the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels. 
 
 == Vehicles == 
 Because of the effect the wheelbase has on the [[weight distribution]] of the vehicle, wheelbase [[wikt:dimension|dimension]]s are very important to the [[wikt:balance|balance]] and [[steering]]. In [[Auto racing|high performance vehicles]] a longer wheelbase is more [[Stability|stable]] at higher [[speed]]s. < ref name=F1 > {{cite web |url=http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/wheel_base.html |title=Wheelbase |author= |date= |website= |publisher=formula1-dictionary.net |accessdate=25 May 2015}} < /ref >  A short wheelbase vehicle is usually able to corner faster but may be less [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]]. < ref name=F1/ >  The wheelbase, along with the track, affects a vehicle's steering angle (how sharply it can turn). < ref > Victor Albert Walter Hillier; Peter Coombes, ''Hillier's Fundamentals of Motor Vehicle Technology'', Book 1 (Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes, 2004), p. 363 < /ref > 
 
 Wheelbase has an effect on a vehicle's [[turning radius]] (or turning circle). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.carbibles.com/steering_bible.html |title=The Steering Bible |author= |date= |website=The Car Bible |publisher=Chris Longhurst |accessdate=24 May 2015 |archive-date=25 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425061750/http://www.carbibles.com/steering_bible.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This is the smallest [[circle]] an automobile can turn or [[U-turn (maneuver)|U-turn]] within. A long wheelbase automobile or truck cannot turn as sharply as a short wheelbase vehicle. 
 
 == Towing and wheelbase == 
 If the vehicle is [[wikt:tow|tow]]ing a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] (in [[British English]] a caravan) the weight distribution of the trailer is [[wikt:critical|critical]]. < ref name=GMTT > {{cite web |url=http://www.gmc.com/trailering-towing/tongue-weight.html |title=Tongue Weight and Its Role in Safe Trailering or Towing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=General Motors |accessdate=24 May 2015}} < /ref >  If too much of the trailer's weight, called  " tongue weight " , presses down on the vehicle's [[tow hitch]] (more than 15 percent) it can cause the vehicle to go out of control. < ref name=GMTT/ >  Too little tongue weight (less than 10 percent) can cause the trailer to [[wikt:sway|sway]] from side to side. < ref name=GMTT/ >  this in turn can make the vehicle difficult or even impossible to control. The shorter the wheelbase the more quickly these forces can cause a loss of control. A longer wheelbase vehicle is generally more desirable for towing. Each vehicle has a tow rating showing how much weight it can tow safely. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.trailerlife.com/trailer-towing-guides/ |title=Trailer Towing Guides |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Trailer Life Magazine |accessdate=24 May 2015 |archive-date=24 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524001238/http://www.trailerlife.com/trailer-towing-guides/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 A vehicle's wheelbase is also important to the overall [[wikt:aesthetic|aesthetic]] [[wikt:appeal|appeal]] of a automobile [[design]]. Wheelbase is part of the [[wikt:balance|balance]] and [[wikt:proportion|proportion]] of an automobile. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/display/store4/item78132/ |title=Starting Out: Car Design Glossary - Part 1 |author=David Browne |date=3 July 2007 |website= |publisher=Car Design News, Ltd. |accessdate=24 May 2015 |archive-date=30 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130121243/http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/display/store4/item78132/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   Some [[Luxury vehicle]]s are offered with long wheelbases to increase the [[wikt:spaciousness|spaciousness]] and [[luxury]] of the vehicle. This is found most often on [[full-size car]]s. In contrast, [[coup√©]] varieties of the some vehicles such as the [[Honda Accord]] are usually built on shorter wheelbases than the [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]s they are based on.
