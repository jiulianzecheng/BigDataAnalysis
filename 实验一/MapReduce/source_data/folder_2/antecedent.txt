In grammar, an '''antecedent''' is a word or [[phrase]] that is repeated by another word or phrase. An antecedent is most often used with relative pronouns, words like  " what " ,  " that " , and  " who " . The [[pronoun]] usually begins the relative [[clause]] and the antecedent is in the main clause.  
 
 == Examples == 
 ''I want a '''book''' '''that''' I can read''. 
 
 In the [[Wikt:above#adjective|above]] example, the relative pronoun 'that' refers back to the antecedent, the word 'book'. [[Wikt:therefore|Therefore]], the main clause is  " I want a book "  and the relative clause is  " that I can read " .  
 
 Some more examples:  
 *  < u > Willy < /u >  said '''he''' likes chocolate.  < small > - [[wikt:noun|Noun]] as antecedent < /small > 
 *  < u > My eccentric uncle < /u >  likes chocolate. '''He''' tells everyone to buy him chocolate.  < small > - Noun phrase as antecedent < /small > 
 * Larry was  < u > helpful < /u > , and '''so''' was Kim.  < small > - [[wikt:adjective|Adjective]] as antecedent < /small > 
 * He arrived  < u > in the afternoon < /u > , '''when''' nobody was home.  < small > - [[:en:Adpositional_phrase#Prepositional_phrases|Prepositional phrase]] as antecedent < /small > 
 The relative pronouns are: [[Wikt:who|who]], [[Wikt:whom|whom]], [[Wikt:whose|whose]], [[Wikt:which|which]], [[Wikt:that#Subordinator|that]].
