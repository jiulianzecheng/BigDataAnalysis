 '''Aquincum''' ({{IPA-la|aˈkᶣɪŋkũː|lang}}) was an ancient city, situated on the North East of [[Pannonia]] in [[Roman Empire]]. The ruins of the city can be found today in [[Budapest]], the capital of [[Hungary]]. It is believed that [[Marcus Aurelius]] lived there some time. Aquincum was settled by a Celtic tribe and was a military base at that time (1 century AD). After AD 106, Aquincum became the capital city of the Pannon province. < ref > {{Cite news|date=2015-10-17|title=Pannonia – Province by the Danube|language=en-US|work=Rome Across Europe|url=http://www.romeacrosseurope.com/?p=3001#sthash.DVZx2ZQ0.dpbs|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-date=2018-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110040429/http://www.romeacrosseurope.com/?p=3001#sthash.DVZx2ZQ0.dpbs|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
