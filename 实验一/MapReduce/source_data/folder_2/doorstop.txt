 A '''doorstop''' (or '''door stop''' or '''doorstopper''') is a [[tool]]. 
 
 There are two types. One holds a [[door]] open (or ''stops'' it from closing), and the other stops the door from hitting a [[wall]]. 
 
 Doorstops that keep the door from hitting a wall can be put on the door, or on the wall, or on the [[floor]] in front of the wall. 
 
 Doorstops that are used to keep a door open come in two varieties: 
 *Attached to the door they are supposed to stop 
 *[[Wedge (mechanics)|Wedges]] that can be put under the door they should stop, or anything heavy put in front of the door
