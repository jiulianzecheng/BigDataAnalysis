An '''icosidodecahedron''' is a [[polyhedron]] (a three-dimensional shape) with 20 (''icosi'') [[triangular]] faces and 12 (''dodeca'') [[Pentagon|pentagonal]] faces. An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]], with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon. As such it is one of the [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean solids]] and more especially, a [[quasiregular polyhedron]].
