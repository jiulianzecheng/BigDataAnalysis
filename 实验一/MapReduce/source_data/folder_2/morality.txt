'''Morality ''' is the concept of doing the right thing. [[Moral]]s are basic guidelines for living. 
 
 Many people have written about ways of choosing what the right thing is. Some believe that there is an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] (true even if you do not agree with it) morality, often thinking it was set by [[God]] or another similar being; others think that morality is [[subjective]] (that what is good or bad is a [[community]] choice). 
 
 People can learn morals from [[religion]], [[parent]]s, [[friends]], [[school]], [[book]]s, or from [[ethical tradition]]s. People that teach or follow morals are called moralists. 
 
 It can also be a lesson that someone learns in a book or story. It is usually one line at the end of the story ( " The moral of this story is..... " ). [[Fable]]s are stories with a moral.  
 
 The opposite of  " moral "  is  " immoral " , meaning the wrong thing to do.  " Amoral "  means something that is not related to morality, or has no morally good or bad aspect to it. It is the same as  " morally neutral " . Morality means that you can tell between a right and a wrong thing. 
 
 Some morally correct things to do are 
 
 •Eat healthy 
 
 •Sleep well 
 
 •be polite 
 
 •use your brain 
 
 •use [[common sense]] 
 
 •Don't [[Smoking|smoke]] 
 
 •Don't drink alcohol 
 
 •Don't [[murder]]
