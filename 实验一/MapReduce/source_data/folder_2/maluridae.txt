 '''Maluridae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of small, [[insectivorous]] [[passerine]] [[bird]]s [[endemic]] to [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]].  
 
 Commonly known as 'wrens', they are unrelated to the [[wren|true wrens]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The family includes 15 [[species]] of fairywren, 3 emu-wrens, and 11 grasswrens. There are six [[genera]]. 
 
 The Maluridae are one of the many bird families to have evolved from a great [[adaptive radiation]] of what were [[crows]] to new ecological opportunities in [[Australasia]]. Their closest relatives are the Meliphagidae ([[honeyeater]]s), and the [[Pardalotidae]]. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Barker |first=FK |author2=Barrowclough GF |author3=Groth JG  |year=2002 |title=A phylogenetic hypothesis for passerine birds: taxonomic and biogeographic implications of an analysis of nuclear DNA sequence data |journal=Proc.

 Their obvious similarity to the [[wren]]s of [[Europe]] and America is not [[genetic]], but simply the consequence of [[convergent evolution]] between more-or-less unrelated species that share the same [[ecological niche]]. 
 
 Their behaviour is similar to many other passerine families. The males defend [[territory (animal)|territory]] and attract females by song and bright coloured plumage.   Females are a dowdy brownish colour, better for [[camouflage]]. The males' colour is much less bright out of season. They are [[insectivorous]], and [[nest]] in dense undergrowth. The parallels with [[Eurasian]] wrens are quite striking.
