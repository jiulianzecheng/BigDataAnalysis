 ''The '''Einsatzgruppen''''' were a [[paramilitary]] group in [[Nazi Germany]] created by the notorious [[SS|Nazi SS-Gestapo Officer]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] . They were part of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' ([[SS]]).  They helped make [[The Holocaust]] happen by [[Mass murder|murdering]] about 12 million people throughout [[Europe]].  Almost all of the people they killed were [[civilian]]s. 
 
 Sometimes, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' would kill only a few people at once.  Other times, they would [[mass murder|kill thousands]] of people in a few days.  For example, at [[Babi Yar]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' killed 33,771 [[Jew]]ish people in two days. 
 
 Most of the people the ''Einsatzgruppen'' killed were Jews.  They killed between 5 and 6 million Jews. < ref name=rhodes > {{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Richard | title = Masters of Death: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust | url = https://archive.org/details/mastersofdeathss0000rich | location = New York | publisher = Vintage Books | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-375-70822-7}} < /ref > < sup > p. & nbsp;257 < /sup >    However, they also killed hundreds of thousands of [[Poles|Polish people]], [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], and [[Roma people]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. 
 
 After Nazi Germany lost [[World War II]], 24 leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were put on [[trial]] for [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].  Sixteen were [[convicted]].  Fourteen were [[sentenced to death]], and two were [[sentenced]] to life in prison.  Other countries later tried four other ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders, convicted them, and sentenced them to death. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > pp=274–275 < /sup > 
 
 ==Creation and Action T4== 
 SS leader [[Reinhard Heydrich]] created the ''Einsatzgruppen'' around 1938. < ref > {{cite web | last = Edeiken | first = Yale F. | publisher = Holocaust History Project | title = Introduction to the Einsatzgruppen | date = August 22, 2000 | url = http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430170251/http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |accessdate= March 11, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 At first, in October 1938, Heydrich sent the ''Einsatzgruppen'' to the [[Sudetenland]].  [[Adolf Hitler]], the leader of Nazi Germany, wanted to take over the Sudetenland.  He was ready to use the Nazi [[military]] to [[invasion|invade]] the area.  However, in the [[Munich Agreement]], world powers agreed that Hitler could have the Sudetenland.  The ''Einsatzgruppen'' helped take over government buildings, and took all the government papers they could find.  They also arrested about 10,000 [[Czech people|Czech]] [[communist]]s and German citizens. < ref > {{cite book | last = Streim | first = Alfred | chapter = The Tasks of the SS Einsatzgruppen, pages 436–454 | title = The Nazi Holocaust, Part 3, The  " Final Solution " : The Implementation of Mass Murder, Volume 2 | editor1-last = Marrus | editor1-first = Michael| publisher = Meckler | location = Westpoint, CT | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-88736-266-4 | page=436 }} < /ref > < ref name=long12 > {{cite book | last = Longerich | first = Peter | year = 2012 | title = Heinrich Himmler: A Life | url = https://archive.org/details/heinrichhimmler0000long | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-959232-6}} < /ref > < sup > pp. & nbsp;405, 412 < /sup > 
 
 From September to December 1939, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' took part in the Nazis' [[Action T4]] program.  The Nazis believed that people with [[physical disability|physical]], [[intellectual disability|intellectual]], and [[mental illness|mental]] disabilities [[Nazi eugenics|did not deserve to live]].  Action T4 was a plan to kill them all.  At first, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and other Nazis shot these people.  However, by spring of 1940, the Nazis started using [[gas chamber]]s so they could kill people with disabilities more quickly. < ref name=long10 > {{cite book | last = Longerich | first = Peter | title = Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews | url = https://archive.org/details/holocaustnaziper0000long | year = 2010 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-280436-5}} < /ref > < sup > pp. & nbsp;138–141 < /sup > 
 
 ==Invasion of Poland== 
 {{See also|Invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland}} 
 In 1939, Hitler decided to [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invade Poland]].  Heydrich decided the ''Einsatzgruppen'' would follow the [[Wehrmacht|regular German Army]]. < ref name=long12/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;425 < /sup >   Their job would be to kill the most important people in Polish [[society]], like [[clergy]], teachers, and members of the [[academia]].

 Finally, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' forced the surviving Jews in Poland to move to [[ghetto]]s in big Polish citiies. The Nazis planned to get rid of all the Jews in Poland, but they had not yet decided where to send them. < ref name=weale12 > {{cite book | last = Weale | first = Adrian | title = Army of Evil: A History of the SS | url = https://archive.org/details/armyofevilhistor0000weal | year = 2012 | publisher = Penguin Group | location = New York; Toronto | isbn = 978-0-451-23791-0}} < /ref > < sup > pp. & nbsp;227–228, 242-245 < /sup >   With the help of the German Army, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' also forced tens of thousands of Jews eastward into the part of Poland that the Soviet Union had taken over. < ref name=long12/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;429 < /sup >

 In 1941, Hitler decided to invade the Soviet Union.  He called this plan [[Operation Barbarossa]].  Hitler hated [[communism]].  He wanted to take over the communist Soviet Union, and kill communism for good. < ref name=hill89 > {{cite book | last = Hillgruber | first = Andreas | chapter = War in the East and the Extermination of the Jews | pages = 85–114 | series = The Nazi Holocaust | title = Part 3, The  " Final Solution " : The Implementation of Mass Murder, Volume 1 | editor1-first = Michael | editor1-last = Marrus | publisher = Meckler | location = Westpoint, CT | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-88736-266-4}} < /ref > < sup > pp. & nbsp;95–96 < /sup > 
 
 In May 1941, Heydrich gave the ''Einsatzgruppen'' an order to kill the Jews in the Soviet Union. < ref name=hill89/ > < sup > pp. & nbsp;94–95 < /sup > 
 
 In June 1941, [[Heinrich Himmler]], the leader of the SS, told other SS leaders that the Nazis planned to kill up to 30 million people in the Soviet Union.  The ''Einsatzgruppen'' would play an important part in this by murdering people who [[Nazi eugenics|the Nazis thought were inferior]].  However, the Nazis would also use other strategies, like [[starvation]], to kill other Soviets. < ref name=long10/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;181 < /sup >

 # To kill all of the top leaders of the Soviet Union; and

 The ''Einsatzgruppen'' did these jobs in many ways.  Sometimes, they would make lists of people who they thought were enemies, and would then murder them.  Other times, they would perform [[massacre]]s of thousands of people over a few days.  For example, at Babi Yar, one ''Einsatzgruppen'' battalion killed 33,771 Jews in two days; in the [[Rumbula massacre]], another killed about 25,000 people in two days. < ref > {{cite web | last = Browning | first = Christopher R. | title = Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland | publisher = Penguin | location = London; New York | orig-year = 1992 | year = 1998 | url=http://hampshirehigh.com/exchange2012/docs/BROWNING-Ordinary%20Men.%20Reserve%20Police%20Battalion%20101%20and%20the%20Final%20Solution%20in%20Poland%20(1992).pdf | accessdate = March 11, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019043400/http://hampshirehigh.com/exchange2012/docs/BROWNING-Ordinary%20Men.%20Reserve%20Police%20Battalion%20101%20and%20the%20Final%20Solution%20in%20Poland%20(1992).pdf | archivedate = October 19, 2013 | url-status = live |pages=135-136, 141-142}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | last = Robertson | first = Struan | title = The genocidal missions of Reserve Police Battalion 101 in the General Government (Poland) 1942–1943 | work = Hamburg Police Battalions during the Second World War | publisher = Regionalen Rechenzentrum der Universität Hamburg | url = http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/rz3a035//police101.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080222023331/http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/rz3a035//police101.html | archivedate = February 22, 2008 | accessdate = March 11, 2016}} < /ref >

 ==Killings in the Soviet Union== 
 ===Orders to kill=== 
 After the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, the ''Einsatzgruppen''{{'}}s main job was still to kill civilians, like they did in Poland.  However, this time, Heydrich ordered the ''Einsatzgruppen'' to kill: 
 [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-A0706-0018-030, Ukraine, ermordete Familie.jpg|thumb|300px|A teenage boy stands beside his murdered family just before he is shot. Ukraine, July 1941]]

 ==Killings in the Baltic States== 
 ''Einsatzgruppe A'' worked in the [[Baltic States]] of [[Estonia]], Latvia, and Lithuania.  These countries had been occupied by the Soviet Union before the Nazis took them over.

 The head of ''Einsatzgruppe A'' let a [[violent]] [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] man named [[Viktors Arājs]] start a smaller ''Einsatzgruppe'' called the Arājs Kommando.  Together, the two groups killed 2,300 Jews in Riga, Lithuania.  Within six months, the Arājs Kommando killed about half of the Jews in Latvia. < ref name = Klee_18 > Klee, Ernst (2005) (in German).

 ===Rumbula massacre===

 The Nazis moved people towards a nearby [[forest]] a thousand at a time.  They shot people who tried to run away or could not walk fast enough.  They took the things the Jews had brought with them, and made them take off their clothes.  Then, fifty at a time, they made the victims lie down in a mass grave and shot them. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > pp. & nbsp;208–210 < /sup >

 After a while, Himmler realized that the ''Einsatzgruppen''{{'}}s [[wikt:method|methods]] were not the best way to kill people as quickly and cheaply as possible. < ref name=rees97/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;197 < /sup >   He also found that many ''Einsatzgruppen'' had trouble killing so many people.  Some had physical and [[mental health]] problems, and others became [[alcoholic]]s. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > pp. & nbsp;52, 124, 168 < /sup >   Himmler made a final decision after watching a mass [[execution]] in August 1941.  He decided that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men. < ref name=long12/ > < sup > pp. & nbsp;547–548 < /sup > 
 
 Himmler decided that the answer to this problem was to kill Jews (and others) with [[poison gas]]. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;167 < /sup >   Starting in 1942, all of the main ''Einsatzgruppen'' began killing people using [[gas van]]s, which had been used to kill people with disabilities early on in Action T4.  In these vans, [[carbon monoxide]] [[exhaust]] fumes from the vans' [[engine]]s were pumped into the back of the truck, killing the victims inside.  However, by September 1941, Nazis at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] had begun [[experiment]]ing with [[Zyklon B]], a [[cyanide]]-like [[pesticide]]. < ref name=long10/ > < sup > pp. & nbsp;280–281 < /sup > 
 
 At the [[Wannsee Conference]] on January 20, 1942, the Nazis officially decided to kill all of the Jews in Europe (11 million people).  Some would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]].  Others would be killed in [[extermination camp]]s (death camps).({{lang-de|link=no|Die Endlösung der Judenfrage}}). < ref name=long12/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;555-556 < /sup >   The Nazis created death camps like [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] and [[Bełżec extermination camp]]s with the goal of killing as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.  These death camps replaced the ''Einsatzgruppen'' as the Nazis' main strategy of mass murder and [[genocide]]. < ref name=long10/ > < sup > pp. & nbsp;279–280 < /sup > 
 
 At first, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were sent to fight [[partisan]]s {{ndash}} people in Nazi-occupied territories who continued to fight back against the Nazis. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;248 < /sup >   However, by 1944, most ''Einsatzgruppen'' had become part of [[Waffen-SS]] fighting units or sent to guard death camps.

 ==Jäger Report== 
 [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0716-0005-007, Oberstes Gericht, Globke-Prozess, Beweisstück.jpg|thumb|170px|The Jäger Report]] 
 The ''Einsatzgruppen'' kept careful records of their mass murders so they could write reports to their supervisors.  The Commander of ''Einsatzgruppe A'' filed the Jäger Report on December 1, 1941.  it talks about ''Einsatzgruppen A''{{'}}s actions in Lithuania. 
 
 The report says that ''Einsatzgruppen A'' killed 137,346 people. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;215 < /sup >   Most were Jews, but others were communists, criminals, and other Nazi  " enemies. " < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;126 < /sup >   Starting in mid-August, when 3,207 people were murdered, the victims included children. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;126 < /sup > 
 
 In February 1942, Jäger changed his [[estimate]]s of how many people the ''Einsatzgruppen'' killed. He said there were 138,272 victims, including: < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;126 < /sup > 
 * 48,252 men (35%) 
 * 55,556 women (40%) 
 * 34,464 children (25%) 
 
 Jäger also said that only 1,851 of the victims (1.3%) were not Jewish. < ref name=rhodes/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;126 < /sup > 
 
 ==Other reports== 
 Many other papers and reports written by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' talk about how many people the different units killed.  For example, one [[researcher]] looked at over 200 Operational Situation Reports (reports from the ''Einsatzgruppen'' to their bosses about what they were doing).  He also looked at letters and reports written by ''Einsatzgruppen'' bosses.  He found that as of 1942, ''Einsatzgruppen A, B, C'', and ''D'' had killed almost a million people: < ref name= " tables " > {{cite book |title=Messages of Murder: A Study of the Reports of the Einsatzgruppen of the Security Police and the Security Service, 1941-1943 |author=Ronald Headland |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |year=1992 |pages=98–101 |isbn=0838634184 |chapter=Tables of Killing Statistics: ''Einsatzgruppe'' A, B, C, and D |url=}} < /ref >
