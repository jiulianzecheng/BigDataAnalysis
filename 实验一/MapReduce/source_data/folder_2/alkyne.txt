An '''alkyne''' is a [[molecule]] that has a [[triple bond]] between two [[carbon]] atoms. They have general formula C < sub > n < /sub > H < sub > 2n-2 < /sub > . They are also called acetylenes. The smallest alkyne is [[acetylene]], also called ethyne. Alkynes are [[hydrophobic]]: this means they dissolve well in organic [[solvent]]s but not in [[water]]. 
 
 Alkynes are more reactive than usual [[hydrocarbon]]s. For example, they are more reactive than [[alkene]]s in many reactions. If the alkyne is at the end of a molecule, it is easy to remove the [[proton]] with a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]]. Then, the alkyne can be used in [[addition reaction]]s. For example, it can be added to a [[ketone]]. Alkynes are also easy to [[redox|reduce]] to [[double bond]]s. They can be made into both ''trans'' and ''cis'' double bonds. Alkynes are also used a lot in [[pericyclic reaction]]s. 
 
 == Structure == 
 Alkynes have a 180 [[degree (angle)|degrees angle]] between the two carbon atoms. For this reason, they do not like to be in a [[cyclic compound]]. Some examples of alkynes are shown below.
