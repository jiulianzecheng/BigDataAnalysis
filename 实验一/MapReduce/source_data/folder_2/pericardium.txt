 '''Pericardium''' is a thin, conical, fibroelastic sac or a membrane surrounding hearts and its great vessels. < ref > Definition of PERICARDIUM " . merriam-webster.com. Retrieved 2021-08-10. < /ref > 
 
 Various functions of pericardium include preventing dislocation of heart by maintaining its original position, providing mechanical support to the heart and its great vessels and act as a lubrication, to lessen friction between the heart and the neighboring structures. 
 
 ==Gross anatomy== 
 Anatomically It has two main parts fibrous pericardium and serous pericardium. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == Histology == 
 Histologically, pericardium consists of three layers: the serosa, the fibrosa, and an outer layer of epipericardial [[connective tissue]]. 
 Pericardial fluid is present in between these two layers. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Jaworska-Wilczynska|first1=Maria|last2=Trzaskoma|first2=Pawel|last3=Szczepankiewicz|first3=Andrzej A.|last4=Hryniewiecki|first4=Tomasz|date=2016|title=Pericardium: structure and function in health and disease|url=|journal=Folia Histochemica et Cytobiologica|volume=54|issue=3|pages=121–125|doi=10.5603/FHC.a2016.0014|issn=|pmid=27654013}} < /ref > 
 The parietal pericardium (thickness 0.8–1 & nbsp;mm) consists of an outer fibrous connective tissue sac lined by serosa. The serosa comprises unilayer mesothelium (which is responsible for the formation and reabsorption of pericardial fluid) . It is surrounded by variable amount of fatty [[Tissue|tissues]], particularly in the cardiophrenic angles. < ref name= " :0 " > Structure of the Human Pericardium and Responses to Pathologic Processes " .

 The pericardial sac consists of two pericardial sinuses namely oblique sinus and transverse sinus. < ref name= " :0 "  / >

 Pericardial effusion is clinical conditions characterized by excessive pericardial fluids in between the parietal and visceral layers. < ref > {{Cite book|url=|title=Pericardial Effusion|last1=Willner|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Goyal|first2=Amandeep|last3=Grigorova|first3=Yulia|last4=Kiel|first4=John|date=2021|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|location=Treasure Island (FL)|pmid=28613741}} < /ref >  Pericardiocentesis is a clinical procedure  carried out to remove excessive fluid that has built up in a  pericardium. < ref > " Pericardiocentesis " . hopkinsmedicine.org.
