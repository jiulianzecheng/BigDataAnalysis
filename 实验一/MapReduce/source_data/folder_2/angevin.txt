'''Angevin''' is the name of the residents of [[Anjou]], a former province of the Kingdom of [[France]], as well as to the residents of [[Angers]]. It is also used for three different [[Middle Ages|medieval]] dynasties which go back to [[count]]s (from [[1360]], dukes) of the western [[France|French]] [[province]] of [[Anjou]] (of which ''angevin'' is the adjectival form), but later came to rule far greater areas including [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Ireland]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], ''Kingdom of Naples and Sicily'', and [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (''see [[Angevin Empire]]'').   
 
 The first of these Angevin dynasties, the [[House of Plantagenet]], ruled England in some form or another from the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], beginning in 1154, until the [[House of Tudor]] came to power when [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] fell at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485.
