A '''hydrocarbon''' is a type of [[chemical compound]]. It is made of only [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] [[atom]]s. 
 They can be found in crude oil and are separated by [[fractional distillation]] (which means they are separated into different groups). The hydrogen and carbon are bonded with non-polar covalent bonds. Because of its lack of '''polar covalent bonds''', hydrocarbons cannot create hydrogen bonds with water and are '''hydrophobic'''. 
 
 == Hydrocarbon  " families "  == 
 Hydrocarbons are grouped into  " families "  or  " [[homologous series]] " . There are five main families. The hydrocarbons in each family have a general formula and similar chemical properties, and similar trends in physical properties. This system was approved in 1892 by the International Congress of Chemists, meeting in [[Geneva]]. 
 
 ===Alkanes=== 
 {{main|Alkane}} 
 Alkanes are the simplest hydrocarbons. Their general formula is C < sub > n < /sub > H < sub > 2n+2 < /sub > .

 |} 
 
 ===Alkenes=== 
 {{main|Alkene}} 
 [[Alkene|Alkenes]] are similar to [[alkane]]s. The main difference between them is that alkenes have a carbon to carbon double bond. The general formula for the alkenes is C < sub > n < /sub > H < sub > 2n < /sub > .

 |- 
 | Decene 
 | C < sub > 10 < /sub > H < sub > 20 < /sub > 
 |} 
 
 Note that there is no  " Methene " . Methene is not possible as alkenes require a carbon-carbon double bond and methane only has one carbon atom. 
 
 ===Alkynes=== 
 {{main|Alkyne}} 
 [[Alkyne]]s have a carbon to carbon triple bond. C < sub > n < /sub > H < sub > 2n-2 < /sub >  is their general formula. 
 {| class= " wikitable "

 |} 
 
 " Methyne "  does not exist because of methane's one carbon atom. 
 
 ===Cycloalkanes=== 
 {{main|Cycloalkane}} 
 [[Cycloalkane]]s are [[isomer]]s of [[alkene]]s. They have the same general formula (C < sub > n < /sub > H < sub > 2n < /sub > ), the only difference is that they do not have a carbon to carbon double bond. 
 {| class= " wikitable " 
 |-

 | C < sub > 3 < /sub > H < sub > 6 < /sub >

 |- 
 | Cyclodecane 
 | C < sub > 10 < /sub > H < sub > 20 < /sub > 
 |} 
 Note that the alkene Ethene does not have a cycloalkane as it can only form a straight line. 
 
 ===Alkadiene=== 
 {{main|Alkadiene}} 
 Alkadienes have two carbon to carbon double bonds. Their general formula is C < sub > n < /sub > H < sub > 2n-2 < /sub > . They are isomers of [[Alkyne]]s. 
 
 In a similar manner, there can also exist alkatriene (three carbon to carbon bonds) and other forms. The versatile nature of Carbon's chemistry allows for a nearly infinite number of configurations and compounds. 
 
 == Aromatic hydrocarbons == 
 {{main|Aromatic hydrocarbons}} 
 Aromatic hydrocarbons are aromatic organic molecules that form flat ring-shaped bonds. The most simplest of aromatic hydrocarbons are [[benzene]] and indole. They can have one ring, ''heterocyclic'', like [[benzene]] or 2 rings, ''bicyclic'' like napthalene (primary ingredient in mothballs) or many rings, ''polycyclic'' like anthracene (red dye colourant). 
 Their general formula is C < sub > n < /sub > H < sub > 2n-6 < /sub > , where n is a number greater than or equal to 6.
