 Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) is an inherited condition that causes short stature, round face, and short hand bones.[3223][10875] PPHP causes joints and other soft tissues in the body to harden. It also affects how bones are formed. 
 
 PPHP is genetically related to pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP-1a). Signs and symptoms are similar, however people with PPHP do not show resistance to parathyroid hormone while people with PHP-1a do. Obesity is characteristic for PHP-1a and may be severe, while obesity is less prominent and may be absent among people with PPHP. Both PHP-1a and PPHP are caused by mutations that affect the function of the ''GNAS'' gene. But people who inherit the mutation from their ''mother'' develop PHP-1a; whereas those who inherit the mutation from their ''father'' develop PPHP.[3223]
