A '''principality''' (sometimes also called '''princedom''') is a [[country]] or territory which is ruled by a [[prince|sovereign prince]] or [[princess]]. Principalities were common in the [[Middle Ages]]. Principalities tend to have quite a small territory.  
 
 == Current principalities == 
 There are currently three countries which are principalities: [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. 
 
 * {{Flagicon|Andorra}} The '''Principality of [[Andorra]]''' is a small country in [[Western Europe]] which borders [[Spain]] and [[France]]. Andorra has two heads of state known as  " Co-Princes " . The two Co-Princes are [[Emmanuel Macron]] (also [[President of the French Republic|President of France]]) and [[Joan Enric Vives Sicília]] (who is also [[Bishop]] of [[Urgell]]). 
 * {{Flagicon|Liechtenstein}} The '''Principality of [[Liechtenstein]]''' is a very small country located in the [[Alps]]. It was named after the ruling family, the House of Liechtenstein. The principality was once a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] but eventually became independent. The ruler of Liechtenstein holds the title  " ''Fürst'' " , which is usually translated as  " Prince " . 
 * {{Flagicon|Monaco}} The '''Principality of [[Monaco]]''' is the second-smallest country in the world. It borders [[France]]. Monaco's ruler is the  " Sovereign Prince " . 
 
 == Sub-national principalities == 
 Many states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were small principalities with their own royal families.  
 
 In modern [[Europe]], there are some cases where the heir to the throne of a country holds the title  " Prince of... " , followed by the name of a significant region of the country. This mostly has some historical meaning. 
 
 * {{Flagicon|Asturias}} The '''Principality of''' '''[[Asturias]]''' is one of [[Spain]]'s [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]]. The heir to the throne of Spain has the title  " Prince/Princess of Asturias " . 
 * {{Flagicon|Wales}} '''[[Wales]]''' is one of the four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries]] part of the [[United Kingdom]]. The heir to the throne of the UK holds the title [[Prince of Wales]]. This is because the [[Principality of Wales]] formerly existed before Wales and [[England]] became a single legal entity. 
 
 == Micronations == 
 Some states claim to be principalities but are not recognised by other countries: [[Sealand]] (a [[Maunsell Forts|Sea Fort]] off the [[England|English]] coast), [[Seborga]] (a small town in [[Italy]]), the [[Principality of Hutt River]] in [[Australia]] and the [[Principality of Minerva]] in the [[Pacific]]. These states are examples of [[micronations]]. 
 
 == Colonialism == 
 Sometimes the word is also used to mean dependent [[territory|territories]] in  [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[India]], [[pre-Columbian America]] and [[Oceania]]. For these, the word [[princely states]] is generally preferred, especially if they came under the authority of a European colonial power.
