'''Yabasic''' ('''Yet Another [[BASIC]]''') is an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] [[Computer program|program]] for a [[wikt:version|version]] of [[BASIC (programming language)|BASIC]]. BASIC is a [[programming language]]. BASIC was designed by [[John George Kemeny]] and [[Thomas Kurtz]], in 1964. < !-- Can't use Wikipedia as reference  < ref > {{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BASIC & oldid=882127700|title=BASIC|date=7 February 2019|publisher=|via=Wikipedia}} < /ref > -- >  Yabasic was born in 1995, 32 years later. Pedro Sá and Thomas Larsen are now developing version 3 of Yabasic. Yasbic is very [[wikt:compact|compact]] at about 250 [[kilobyte]]s total length. 
 
 ==How it works== 
 To write something on the monitor, like Hello World, type '''print''' then  < nowiki > " YOUR TEXT HERE " . < /nowiki > 
  Print  " Hello World " 
 
 Study this bit of code: 
  10 beep 
  20 wait 1 
  30 goto 10 
 The result of this code is: < br / > 
 An audible beep is generated < br / > 
 The program waits for 1 second before going onto the next instruction < br / > 
 It then goes back to the start of the program creating an infinite loop. 
 
 This programming language can also be used to create rather complex programs such as one that calculates [[prime numbers]] 
 
  print  " This program will calculate the prime numbers below the limit " 
  input  " limit:  "  limit 
  n=2 
  do 
    for i=2 to sqrt(n) 
      if (frac(n/i)=0) then 
        notprime=1 
        break 
      endif 
    next i 
    if notprime < > 1 then 
      print n 
    endif 
    notprime=0 
    n=n+1 
    if n > limit break 
  loop 
 
 The  " input "  command asks the user to input a value which in this case is number that tells the program what number to stop finding prime numbers at. < br / > 
 The  
  do < br / > ... < br / > loop 
 commands create a loop that can be repeated infinitely. < br / > 
 The 
  for < br / > ... < br / > next 
 commands hold instructions as to what the program is to do while in the loop.  < br / > 
 The 
  if < br / > ... < br / > endif 
 commands tell the program to look for something and if the thing it is looking for is there then it reports back that it is there. < ref > [http://www.basicprogramming.org/wiki/index.php?title=Yabasic::Dev_Tutorial_Create_a_Variable_Type Tutorial on how to create UDTs in Yabasic 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910024327/http://www.basicprogramming.org/wiki/index.php?title=Yabasic::Dev_Tutorial_Create_a_Variable_Type |date=2011-09-10 }} ''www.basicprogramming.org'' < /ref >
