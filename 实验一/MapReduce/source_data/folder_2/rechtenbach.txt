 == Geography == 
 
 === Location === 
 Rechtenbach is in the Würzburg Region in the [[Spessart]] (range) west of [[Lohr am Main]]. The village is in the valley of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rechtenbach (Main)|de|3=Rechtenbach (Main)|lt=Rechtenbach}}, a tributary of the [[Main (river)|Main]]. It is surrounded by forest. 
 
 ===Subdivision=== 
 The community has two ''Gemarkungen'' (traditional rural cadastral area): Rechtenbach and (since January 2014) Rothenberg. The latter was an [[unincorporated area]] until 2013. 
 
 Until the merger with Rothenberg, the municipal territory was not continuous as it included the village and the separate ''Weickertshöhe'' or ''Weickertswiese'', a meadow is on a nearby hill at an altitude of around 500 m. In between the two used to be forest that was part of Rothenberg. 
 
 ===Neighbouring communities=== 
 The municipal territory touches only on the community of Lohr. It also borders on two unincorporated areas, {{Interlanguage link multi|Partensteiner Forst|de}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Forst Lohrerstraße|de}}.
