 '''Poinsettia''' (''Euphorbia pulcherrima'') is a [[red]] and [[green]] [[plant]] popular at [[Christmas]] time. It grows in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] and is an important export. It belongs to the order [[Malpighiales]]. 
 
 [[Image:Poinsettia 2.jpg|thumb|The [[poinsettia]] is a short-day plant. It needs two months of long nights before blooming]] 
 
 Many [[flowering plant]]s use the pigment [[phytochrome]] to sense seasonal changes in [[day]] length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed [[photoperiodism]]. Short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level.  
 
 It is not actually the period of light exposure that limits flowering.  Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24-hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin.   
 
 Plants make use of the phytochrome system to sense day length or photoperiod.  This fact is used by [[florist]]s and [[greenhouse]] gardeners to control and induce flowering out of season, such as with ''[[Poinsettia]]''.
