 '''Flint''', or '''flintstone''', is a kind of [[sedimentary rock]], made of [[silica]]. 
 
 Bands of flint are found embedded in [[chalk]] and other kinds  of soft [[limestone]].  
 
 When the chalk is [[erosion|eroded]], the hard flint nodules survive as [[pebble]]s on a [[shingle beach]]. It may happen that the pebbles later get [[cement]]ed into another rock, such as a [[puddingstone]]. In this way, they make up a sedimentary rock for the second time. 
 
 == Technical description == 
 Flint is a cryptocrystalline (means you can't see the crystals) form of the [[mineral]] [[quartz]]. < ref > [http://webmineral.com/data/Quartz.shtml General Quartz Information]  Webmineral.com < /ref > < ref > [http://www.quartzpage.de/flint.html Flint and Chert] quartzpage.de < /ref >  It is a variety of [[chert]]. It occurs as a line of knobbly masses in  [[chalk]] and some [[limestone]]s. < ref name=Flints > {{Cite web |url=http://www.bbm.me.uk/portsdown/PH_320_Flint.htm |title=''The Flints from Portsdown Hill'' |access-date=2011-07-25 |archive-date=2010-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226114858/http://bbm.me.uk/Portsdown/PH_320_Flint.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.theaaca.com/Learning_Center/flintvs.htm |title=Authentic Artefacts Collectors Assn: Flint vs Chert |access-date=2011-07-25 |archive-date=2004-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040817115706/http://www.theaaca.com/Learning_Center/flintvs.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Inside the nodule, flint is usually [[Translucency|translucent]], and can be various colours.

 == Uses == 
 Flintstones often have a rough lumpy surface but when they are broken, they look like dark glass. It has been one of the most useful types of stone to humankind. 
 
 Flint was used by [[hominin]]s for over three [[million]] years. Stone tools found at [[Lake Turkana]] in [[Kenya]], are dated as 3.3 million years old. This predates the [[genus]] ''Homo'' by half a million years. The oldest known ''Homo'' fossil is 2.8 million years old compared to the 3.3 million year old stone tools. < ref name='Morelle' > {{cite news |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32804177 |title=Oldest stone tools pre-date earliest humans |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=2016-01-03 }} < /ref > 
 
 When flintstones are broken, they have a sharp edge which could be used as a knife, or a scraper.  When flint and an iron-containing material such as [[pyrite]] or [[steel]] are hit together, they can make a spark. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Stapert|first1=Dick|last2=Johansen|first2=Lykke|date=1999-06-01|title=Making fire in the Stone Age: flint and pyrite|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1003802432463|journal=Geologie en Mijnbouw|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=147â€“164|doi=10.1023/A:1003802432463|s2cid=130177701|issn=0016-7746}} < /ref >  For many centuries, flint was one of the main ways for people in many countries to make fire. People would carry a little box called a  " tinder box "  which had some [[tinder]] along with flint and pyrite or steel. The tinder was used to catch the spark and start a fire. Tinder could be sawdust, cloth, grass or bark. Flints were later used to make a spark to fire a gun. A gun that used flint was called a  " [[flintlock]] "  gun. 
 
 Flintstones are used in some countries for building. In England the flintstones used for building were often  " knapped "  which means they were broken to show the inside, like the stones used for the tower of Long Melford Church (below). This gave a better finish to the building that the dull knobbly stones would have made.
