 '''Vegetarianism''' is the practice of not eating [[meat]] or [[fish]]. People who follow vegetarianism are called '''vegetarians'''. Vegetarians eat foods like [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[bean]]s and [[grain]]s. Some vegetarians eat or drink animal products, like [[milk]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]]. They are called lacto-ovo vegetarians. Vegetarian people may like [[tofu]], [[falafel]] and other meat substitutes. 
 
 There are many reasons for not eating meat.  Vegetarians are [[health|healthier]] than other people in some ways. < ref name= " MedToday "  / > < ref name= " Mayo "  / > < ref name= " Nutr "  / >   Some people think that it is wrong to kill animals; others think that eating meat is bad for their [[health]] or the [[world]]. This is because land used for animals can be used to grow food. Some people may become vegetarians because their [[religion]] says not to eat animals. 
 
 Vegetarians who do not drink milk and eat eggs are called [[veganism|vegans]]. < ref name= " MedToday "  / >  Vegans also often will not use animal products like [[leather]], but many vegetarians do use animal products. 
 
 Some people who call themselves vegetarians and eat [[fish]] or sea food are not vegetarians, because fish and sea creatures are also [[animals]]. Such people are sometimes called ''[[pescetarianism|pescetarians]]''. < ref name= " MedToday "  / >  There are also many people who are not vegetarians, but do not eat too much animal food. < ref name= " Mayo "  / >  Some eat only very little meat (so-called  " flexitarians "  or  " [[semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarians]] " ), some eat only [[fowl]] ( " pollotarians " ). There is also a [[philosophy]] called [[freeganism]], it means eating animal products only if  otherwise they will be thrown away to waste - such as food thrown away by restaurants.

 == Reasons  == 
 There are several reasons why people choose to be vegetarians. It has many proven benefits on human [[health]]. < ref name= " MedToday "  / >   Some think it is wrong or cruel to eat animals, since animals are killed and often feel pain. Other people may feel disgusted by meat or do not like the taste. A fourth reason is the effect on the environment. Producing meat (especially beef) uses more of the earth's land and water than eating food from plants. People may have more than one different reason for being a vegetarian. 
 
 ===Health=== 
 
 A vegetarian diet or a diet very low in meat has proven good effects on human health.  It takes work to put together a healthy vegetarian diet that has everything the human body needs. < ref name= " Nutr " > {{cite journal|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15702597/|accessdate=July 24, 2020|journal=Forum Nutr|year=2005|volume=57|pages=147–56|doi=10.1159/000083787|title= Vegetarian diets: what are the advantages? (Abstract)|author=Claus Leitzmann|issue=57|pmid=15702597}} < /ref > < ref name= " Mayo " > {{cite web|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=July 24, 2020|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446|title=Vegetarian diet: How to get the best nutrition|author=Mayo Clinic staff}} < /ref >   When people decide to become vegetarian, they usually think carefully about what they eat and choose healthy food.  They also go to the trouble of finding fresh food more often.  Vegetarians eat lots of antioxidants and natural fiber.  Scientists say vegetarians are less likely to have [[heart disease]], some kinds of [[cancer]], [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]]. < ref name= " MedToday " > {{cite news|publisher=Medical News Today|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8749|accessdate=July 24, 2020|title=What to know about the vegetarian diet}} < /ref > 
 
 === Religious and spiritual === 
 [[File:Vegetarianism AS.jpg|180px|thumb|right|A market in [[India]] sells tasty ingredients for a vegetarian [[diet]].]] Most vegetarians in the world are [[Hindu]]. [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]] in general teach vegetarianism, while [[Buddhism]] may or may not. [[Rastafari]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventism]] also teach vegetarianism. Without any specific [[religion]], some people in the [[Western world]] also follow a vegetarian diet because it may deepen inner spiritual connections (for example, James Redfield). [[Mahatma Gandhi]] said that spiritual experiences are greatly enhanced on a vegetarian diet.  
 
 ==== Hinduism ==== 
 [[Hindu]]s teach vegetarianism as a way to live with a minimum of hurt to other beings. In today’s world, about twenty percent of all Hindus are vegetarians. There are approximately 200 million vegetarians in [[India]], which has more people that do not eat meat than any other country. More vegetarians live in the [[South]] of India than in the [[North]], possibly because the North is colder. For [[yoga]] and [[meditation]], it is wise to be vegetarian. {{fact|date=September 2013}} 
 
 The Hindu who believes in non-injury or nonviolence ([[ahimsa]]) naturally adopts a vegetarian diet. < ref > [http://www.ivu.org/news/march2000/hinduism.html 'Hinduism and Vegetarianism' by Paul Turner, Mar. 2000.] < /ref >  It is a matter of conscience more than anything else. The Vedic and Puranic scriptures of [[Hinduism]] explain that animals have [[soul]]s and the act of killing animals brings bad [[karma]] because the killer will suffer the pain of the animal he has killed in this life or the next. Satguru [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] adds that when we eat meat, fish, [[fowl]] and eggs, we absorb the [[vibration]] of the creatures into our [[nerve]]s. This promotes fear, anger, jealousy, confusion, resentment and the like. < ref > Satguru [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]],  " ''Ten Questions people ask About Hinduism …and ten terrific answers!'' "  (p. 8) [http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/tenq/hindu10questions.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411180040/http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/tenq/hindu10questions.pdf |date=2007-04-11 }} < /ref >  The Manu Dharma Shastras state, “When the diet is pure, the [[mind]] and [[heart]] are pure.” Generally there is the belief, based on scriptures such as [[Bhagavad Gita]], that one's food shapes the [[personality]], mood and [[mind]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/17/en1 |title=Bhagavad Gita Chapter 17, Texts 7-10 |access-date=2007-07-26 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015133/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/17/en1 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
