 '''Kimberlite''' is an [[igneous rock]] best known for sometimes containing [[diamond]]s. It is named after the town of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in [[South Africa]]. The discovery of a big {{convert|83.5|carat|g|adj=on}} diamond in 1871 started a  " diamond rush " . This resulted in the Big Hole, a large [[open mine]]. 
 
 Kimberlite occurs in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] in vertical structures known as  " pipes "  as well as [[igneous]] [[dyke (geology)|dykes]] and [[sill (geology)|sills]]. Kimberlite pipes are the most important source of mined diamonds today. Kimberlites  form deep with the [[Earth's mantle]]. Formation occurs at depths between {{convert|150|and|450|km|mi}} Kimberlite material is erupted rapidly and violently, often with considerable [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[volatiles|volatile]] components.  
 
 Kimberlite has attracted attention because it serves as a carrier of diamonds and garnet [[peridotite]] [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] [[xenolith]]s to the Earth's surface. The study of kimberlite has the potential to provide information about the composition of the [[mantle (geology)#Lower mantle|lower mantle]]. < ref > Nixon P.H. 1995.
