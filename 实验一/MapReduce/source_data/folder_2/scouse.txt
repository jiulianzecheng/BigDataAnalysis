It originated mostly from Irish (from the [[Irish Potato Famine]]) and Welsh immigrants. The Scouse accent is very noticeable and is not similar with those of the neighbouring regions. < ref > {{cite news|author=Dominic Tobin and Jonathan Leake|date=3 January 2010|title=Regional accents thrive against the odds in Britain|publisher=The Sunday Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6973975.ece}} < /ref >  The accent is named after the stew [[scouse]], which Liverpudlians eat a lot. Liverpool's accent is often thought to be informal, like most of the  " Northern "  English accents. 
 
 The accent can now be found in areas close to Liverpool, like [[Widnes]] and [[Runcorn]], because Liverpool was developed a lot in the 1950s. A lot of different types of the accent exist, for example, the Northern accent, which is different from the southern accent.
