 A '''sign''' is something you see (or hear) which means something. A sign may be [[natural]] or [[man-made]]. 
 
 A natural sign shows something significant. [[Leaves]] turn brown and fall off [[deciduous]] trees in the [[autumn]]. Temperatures drop, daylight hours shorten. It suggests [[winter]] is coming. Many birds [[migration|migrate]] and some mammals [[hibernate]] in response to natural signs like these. Humans, as usual, are a bit different. They make their own signs. 
 
 A man-made sign is called a [[signal]] or [[symbol]]. It is an artificial thing, which people decide means something in their society. For example, the [[stop sign]] on the [[road]] tells the person that they must stop their [[Automobile|car]] there. So does a red traffic light. They are signals with a [[legal]] meaning, and people learn what these meanings are. 
 
 Sometimes a person may not know what a sign means. Feeling a cold [[wind]] could be a sign that someone left a [[door]] or [[window]] open. 
 
 In [[medicine]], a sign is something seen, whereas a [[symptom]] is something [[feeling|felt]], like a [[pain]]. A sign might be something like [[high blood pressure]], which can be measured.

 A [[road]] sign or [[traffic sign]] is something that gives information by means of a symbol, or in only 1 or 2 words. It helps people in their [[vehicle]]s on the road. Some signs include: Give way, Stop, Keep left, No U-turn, no parking, [[Zebra]] crossing and much more. Signs are very useful. Without signs and traffic [[light]]s there would be many [[accident]]s and arguments on the road.
