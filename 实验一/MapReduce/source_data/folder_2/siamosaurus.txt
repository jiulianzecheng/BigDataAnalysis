 '''''Siamosaurus''''' (meaning 'Siamese lizard') is a [[carnivorous]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the Early Cretaceous of [[Thailand]]. It is only known from [[fossil]] teeth, so paleontologists don't know much about its size, but it might have reached a length of 9.1 meters (30 ft). The teeth that were discovered looked a lot like those of [[Spinosaurus]], so it probably ate [[fish]]. < ref > Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R. (1986). Unusual theropod dinosaur teeth from the Upper Jurassic of Phu Wiang, northeastern Thailand. Rev. Paleobiol. 5: 217-220. < /ref > 
 
 A study made in 2010 by Roman Amiot and his colleagues compared the teeth of [[spinosaurids]] like ''[[:en:Baryonyx|Baryonyx]]'', ''[[:en:Irritator|Irritator]]'', ''Siamosaurus'', and ''[[:en:Spinosaurus|Spinosaurus]]'' to other meat-eating dinosaurs. They found that spinosaurids had very semiaquatic (living partly in water, and partly on land) lifestyles. This means they lived in [[Habitat|habitats]] like those of [[Hippopotamus|hippopotamuses]], [[Crocodile|crocodiles]], and [[Turtle|turtles]]. It also means they could exist at the same time and place as other large [[Predation|predators]] without competing for food. < ref name= " RMetal10 " > {{cite journal|last=Amiot|first=R.|author2=Buffetaut, E.|author3=Lécuyer, C.|author4=Wang, X.|author5=Boudad, L.|author6=Ding, Z.|author7=Fourel, F.|author8=Hutt, S.|author9=Martineau, F.|year=2010|title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_geology_2010-02_38_2/page/139|journal=Geology|volume=38|issue=2|pages=139–142|doi=10.1130/G30402.1|author10=Medeiros, A.|author11=Mo, J.|author12=Simon, L.|author13=Suteethorn, V.|author14=Sweetman, S.|author15=Tong, H.|author16=Zhang, F.|author17=Zhou, Z.|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A}} < /ref >
