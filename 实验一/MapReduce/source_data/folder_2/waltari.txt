The lead singer and bass guitarist, [[Kärtsy Hattaka]], delivers very distinctive vocal part to their music and makes Waltari's sound even more unique and easily recognizable.  
 
 == Lyrics == 
 Waltari’s lyrics are as diverse as their music. They’re about various range of topics including everyday misery, personal struggles, science fiction motives, and music industry philosophical questions. They have one thing in common – heavy irony, self-irony and sarcasm.  
 
 == Albums == 
 Waltari started their musical career with [[demo]] records. The longest one was ''[[Monk Punk]]''.

Their biggest success among [[death metal]] fans yet came with the ''Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die!'' album, which is mixture of [[death metal]] and [[classical music]]. It also has a musical feeling to it, because it’s kind of an epic story from future sung in dialogues of various characters.  
 
 Next album ''Space Avenue'' is more [[electronic music|electronic]] and it has some [[pop music|pop]] feeling to it. Another one called ''Radium Round'' goes even further in that.
