 A '''tesseract''' is a [[4D|4-dimensional]] object with eight [[cell (geometry)|cell]]s; each cell is a cube. Unlike [[three-dimensional]] objects which rotate on both an [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]] and a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (the plane being of length and width and the axis being of the leftover dimension, height), a tesseract rotates on two planes, one made up of [[length]] and [[width]], and one made up of [[height]] and the [[fourth dimension]]. It is the simplest [[hypercube]]. 
 
 It is not possible to make a tesseract out of real materials. A tesseract is in four [[dimension]]s, but we can only move in three dimensions. 
 
 A Line is to the 1st dimension, Square is to the 2nd dimension, Cube is to the 3rd dimension, Tesseract is to the 4th dimension.
