 A '''statue''' is a model of somebody or something, usually of a person or sometimes an [[animal]]. It is a [[sculpture]]. Several kinds of material can be used to make a statue, e.g. [[stone]], [[bronze]], [[clay]], or [[wood]]. Statues are often at least life-size (the same size as the real person), but often they are much bigger, especially statues in the open air. Statues are often made to remember an important person (such as the statue of [[Alfred the Great]]), or to remember an event or an [[idea]] (such as the [[Statue of Liberty]]).

 Usually there is some writing on a statue to say who the [[person]] is. This writing is called an [[epigraph]]. The statue may be standing on a base. This base is called a  " plinth " . 
 
 A '''bust''' is a statue of the head, shoulders and upper body of a person. 
 
 A '''colossus''' is an enormous statue. 
 
 A statue of someone on horseback (riding a horse) is called an '''equestrian statue'''.
