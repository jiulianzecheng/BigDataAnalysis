 [[File:Giant Oarfish.jpg|thumb|340px|A {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=out|adj=on}} [[Giant Oarfish]] found near [[San Diego, California]] in 1996. It is being held by [[United States]] [[soldier]]s.]] 
 An '''oarfish''' is a kind of very long, flat [[fish]].  " Oarfish "  is another word for fish in the '''Regalecidae''' family. < ref name= " FishbaseReg " > Froese, Rainer, and Daniel Pauly, eds. (2007).  " [http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/FamilySummary.php?Family=Regalecidae Regalecidae] "  in [[FishBase]]. March 2007 version. < /ref >  There are four species of oarfish in the world. The [[giant oarfish]] (''Regalecus glesne'') is the longest [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] alive in the world today. It can grow up to {{convert|17|m|ft}} long. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8501000/8501251.stm  Bourton, Jody. Giant bizarre deep sea fish filmed in Gulf of Mexico.

 Oarfish live in the [[pelagic zone]]. < ref name= " FishbaseReg "  / >  This means that they live in water that is not near the [[shore]] and not near the bottom of the [[ocean]]. They live in all [[Temperate zone|temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Oarfish are also very rare. They are usually only seen when a dead one washes onto the shore. When oarfish are sick or dying, they swim up near the [[surface]] of the water. This behavior means that oarfish are probably the  " [[sea serpent]]s "  in [[legend]]s. 
 
 There are two ideas about why these fish are called  " oarfish. "  One idea is that their bodies look like [[oar]]s because they are very long and flat. The other idea is that some people used to think that oarfish swam by moving their fins like the oars of a [[row boat]]. We now know that this  " [[row]]ing "  idea wrong. < ref name= " Olney " > Olney, John E. (1998). Paxton, J.R.  &  Eschmeyer, W.N., ed. Encyclopedia of Fishes. San Diego: Academic Press. pp. 157â€“159. {{ISBN|0-12-547665-5}}. < /ref >  The family name ''Regalecidae'' comes from a word in {{lang-la|regalis}}, which means  " [[wikt:royal|royal]] " .
