A '''bushranger''' was a  [[thief]] who lived in the [[Australia]]n [[The bush|bush]]. Bushrangers often stole expensive things from [[bank]]s or [[stagecoach|coaches]]. There were more than 2000 bushrangers during Australia's past. Most were simply [[criminal]]s and thieves. A few bushrangers became famous and were seen as [[hero]]es. They are part of a long history that has men such as [[Robin Hood]] and [[Dick Turpin]] in [[England]], or [[Jesse James]] and [[Billy the Kid]] in the [[US]]. < ref name = OC > {{cite book |last= Davey |first= Gwenda |author2= Graham Seal | title =The Oxford Companion to Australian Folklore | publisher = Oxford University Press| date =1993 | location =Melbourne | pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000unse_z4h3/page/58 58]â€“59| url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000unse_z4h3| doi = | id = | isbn = 0195530578}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 The word  " bushranger "  was first used in [[Australia]] in 1805. It described three men who had stopped a cart near [[Sydney]]. Then, the word was used for criminals who attacked people on the roads or in [[the bush]] (the Australian countryside away from towns). 
 
 The first bushrangers were escaped [[convict]]s.  One of the last bushrangers was [[Ned Kelly]] who was captured in 1880. < ref name= " NMA " > {{cite web |url= http://nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/media/media_kits/outlawed_bushrangers_of_australia/files/684/nma_outlawed_bushrangers.pdf |type= pdf |title= Bushrangers of Australia |accessdate= 2007-04-16 |publisher= [[National Museum of Australia]] |archive-date= 2007-06-14 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614223842/http://nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/media/media_kits/outlawed_bushrangers_of_australia/files/684/nma_outlawed_bushrangers.pdf |url-status= dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ===1788 to 1840s: Criminals who escaped=== 
 Criminals who escaped [[wikt:steal|stole]] things from farms far away and people walking on the roads. Sometimes they sold the stolen things to other free [[settler]]s. 
 
 [[John Caesar|John  " Black "  Caesar]] was the first bushranger. < ref name= " NMA " / >  He ran away from Sydney Cove many times before he was shot dead in 1796. 
 
 Bold [[Jack Donahue]] < ref name= " NMA " / >  appeared in [[newspaper]]s around 1827 for bushranging on the [[Old Windsor Road|road]] between [[Sydney]] and [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]]. In the 1830s he was seen as the worst bushranger in the colony. < ref name =  " RTA - Windsor Rd " > {{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show & id=4301011 |title=Old Windsor Road and Windsor Road Heritage Precincts |work=Heritage and conservation register |publisher=[[Roads and Traffic Authority|New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority]] |accessdate=2007-04-20 |archive-date=2007-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903200821/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show & id=4301011 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Leading a gang of escaped criminals, Donahue became an important person in Australian [[folklore]] as the Wild Colonial Boy. < ref name= " NMA " / > 
 
 Bushranging happened all over Australia, but [[Van Diemen's Land]] (later known as [[Tasmania]]) produced the most violent and serious bushrangers. < ref name= " NMA " / >  Hundreds of criminals were at large in the bush, farms were given up, and the [[army]] was brought in to try and capture the bushrangers. [[Indigenous Australian]] bushranger [[Musquito]] led attacks on settlers. 
 
 ===1850s: gold rush era=== 
 The bushrangers were busiest during the [[Victorian gold rush|Gold Rush]] years of the 1850s and 1860s. Gold can be easily carried and also it can easily be turned into [[cash]]. The goldfields were in remote places and there were not very many police to guard the gold. < ref name= " NMA " / > 
 
 George Melville was killed by hanging in front of many people for stealing from the McIvor gold escort near [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]] in 1853. < ref name= " NMA " / > 
 
 ===1860s to 1870s=== 
 Bushranging numbers grew in [[New South Wales]] with the rise of the colonial-born sons of poor, often ex-convict farmers, who wanted a more exciting life than mining or farming. < ref name= " NMA " / > 
 
 Much of the bushranging in these years was in the [[Lachlan River|Lachlan Valley]], around [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]], [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] and [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]]. < ref name= " NMA " / > 
 
 [[Frank Gardiner]], [[John Gilbert (bushranger)|John Gilbert]] and [[Ben Hall]] led the most notorious gangs of the period. Other active bushrangers included [[Dan Morgan (bushranger)|Dan Morgan]], based around the [[Murray River]], and [[Captain Thunderbolt]], killed outside [[Uralla, New South Wales]]. < ref name= " NMA " / > 
 
 ===1880s to 1900s=== 
 The increasing push of settlement, increased police efficiency, better [[History of rail transport in Australia|rail transport]] and communications, such as [[telegraphy]], made it increasingly difficult for bushrangers to evade capture. 
 
 Among the last bushrangers was the Kelly Gang led by [[Ned Kelly]], who were captured at [[Glenrowan, Victoria]] in 1880, two years after they were [[outlaw]]ed. 
 
 In 1900 the [[Jimmy Governor|Governor Brothers]] scared many people in the north of New South Wales. < ref name= " NMA " / >
