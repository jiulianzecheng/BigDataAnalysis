 An '''entablature''' ([[IPA]] [ɛnˈtæblətʃə]; [[Latin]], ''and tabula'', ''a tablet'') is a major piece of [[classical architecture]]. It is the big part of the building made of moldings and bands that sits flat above the [[column]]s, resting on their [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] (tops).   
 
 An entablature is made of three parts:  
 * the [[architrave]] - the bottom part which runs right above the wall or columns below 
 * the [[frieze]] – an unmolded strip that may or may not be decorated 
 * the [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]] - the top part which sticks out below the [[pediment]]. 
 
 The entabulature is an improvement on the older and less advanced [[lintel]], which also sits between two posts and holds up roof rafters.
