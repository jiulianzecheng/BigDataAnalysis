 '''Turpenoids''', or '''isoprenoids''', are a large group of [[organic compound]]s. They are built of five-carbon [[isoprene]] units put together  and modified in thousands of ways. 
 
 They are [[lipids]], and are found in all classes of living things. They are the largest group of natural products. About 60% of natural products are terpenoids. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Firn|first1=Richard|title=Nature's chemicals|date=2010|publisher=Oxford: Biology}} < /ref > 
 
 Plant terpenoids are often used for their [[scent]]. They are used in traditional [[herbal]] remedies. Terpenoids help the scent of [[eucalyptus]], the flavors of [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, and [[ginger]], the yellow color in [[sunflower]]s, and the red color in [[tomato]]es. < ref > {{Cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/28/090928fa_fact_specter?currentPage=all |magazine=The New Yorker |title=A life of its own |author=Michael Specter |date=September 28, 2009}} < /ref >  Well-known terpenoids include [[citral]], [[menthol]], [[camphor]], [[salvinorin A]] in the plant ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'', the [[cannabinoid]]s found in [[cannabis]], [[ginkgolide]] and [[bilobalide]] found in ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'', and the [[curcuminoid]]s found in [[turmeric]] and [[mustard]] seeds. 
 
 The [[steroid]]s and [[sterol]]s in animals are biologically produced from terpenoid precursors.
