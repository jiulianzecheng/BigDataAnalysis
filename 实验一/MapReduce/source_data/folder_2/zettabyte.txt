A '''zettabyte''' ('''ZB''') is a [[unit of measurement]] for [[computer]]s of the future. One zettabyte holds 1000 [[exabyte]]s ('''EB''') or a billion trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) [[byte]]s, and 1000 zettabytes make one [[yottabyte]].  
 
 A zettabyte is so large that it would take about a million [[supercomputer]]s (or a billion powerful home computers)  
 to store this amount of data.
