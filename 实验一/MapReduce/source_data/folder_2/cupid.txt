 '''Cupid''', also called '''Amor''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''love''), is the [[Deity|god]] of sexual desire in [[Roman mythology]]. He fired [[gold]]en [[arrow]]s at people to make them fall in love, and [[lead]] arrows to make people fall out of love. He was mainly drawn as a cherub, but he might have looked like a normal teenager. He had large feathery wings which he used to fly around in the sky and mainly shot people with his love arrows by flying above them. He secretly did this. And many people asked him for help.
