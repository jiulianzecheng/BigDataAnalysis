 '''Aeschylus''' (525 BC – 456 BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] poet and writer. He wrote about 70–90 [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. < ref name= " F243 "  / > < ref name= " P222 "  / >  Only six of his [[tragedy|tragedies]] have survived complete. Aeschylus was the earliest of the three greatest Greek writers of tragedians. The two others were [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. < ref name= " F243 " > {{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=243}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|author=Schlegel, August Wilhelm von|page=121|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7148|title=Lectures on dramatic art and literature}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Aristotle]] said that Aeschylus added more characters into his plays. His characters spoke to each other and not just to the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. This made it easier to create [[drama]] between the characters. 
 
 One of his plays, ''The Persians'', was about the [[Greco–Persian wars|Persian invasion of Greece]]. Aeschylus had fought in this war. People studying Greek history use his play as an important source of information. The war was so important to the Greeks and to Aeschylus, that the writing on his [[grave]] only talks about his part in the Greek victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]]. There is nothing about the plays he wrote. 
 
 == Early life == 
 Aeschylus was born about the year 525 BC in a small town called [[Eleusis]], which is about  27 & nbsp;kilometers northwest of [[Athens]]. < ref name= " S33 " > {{harvnb|Sommerstein|1996|p=33}} < /ref >  The date is based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great [[Dionysia]]. His family was rich, and his father, Euphorion, was a member of the [[Eupatridae]], the ancient nobility of Attica. < ref name= " Bates " > {{harvnb|Bates|1906|pp=53–59}} < /ref >  [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote that Aeschylus  worked in a [[vineyard]] until the god [[Dionysus]] visited him in his sleep. The god ordered him to write the first tragedies. < ref name=Bates / >  His first play was performed in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old. < ref name=S33 / > < ref name=Bates / > 
 
 == The Persian wars == 
 In 490 BC the Persian army, led by [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]], landed in Greece and tried to take it over. Aeschylus, and his brother Cynegeirus, joined the army from Athens and fought against the Persians at the [[Battle of Marathon]]. < ref name=S33 / >  The Athenians were able to defeat the much bigger Persian army. This battle, which stopped Darius, was celebrated across the city-states of Greece. < ref name=S33 / >  Cynegeirus died in the battle. < ref name=S33 / >  In 480 BC, [[Xerxes I of Persia]] tried to capture Greece. Aeschylus fought against them at the [[Battle of Salamis]] and at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479 BC. < ref name=S33 / >  His oldest surviving play ''The Persians'', performed in 472 BC, is set during the Battle of Salamis. This play won first prize at the Dionysia. < ref name= " S34 " > {{harvnb|Sommerstein|1996|p=34}} < /ref > 
 
 == The Eleusinian Mysteries == 
 Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who joined the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. This was the religious [[cult]] of [[Demeter]], and based in his home town of Eleusis. < ref > Martin 2000, § & nbsp;10.1 < /ref >  Members of the group learned mystical and secret knowledge. Members were sworn under the penalty of death not to say anything about the Mysteries to anyone. Aristotle wrote that some people thought that Aeschylus had shown some of the cult's secrets on stage. < ref > ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1111a8–10. < /ref >  Other writers said that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he ran away. Later, Aeschylus said he did not know that he had shown any of the secrets. He was saved from death only because of his brave service in the Persian Wars. 
 
 == Later life == 
 Aeschylus made two trips to [[Sicily]] in the 470s BC. He was invited by [[Hieron]], [[tyrant]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], a big Greek city on the east side of the island. On one of these trips he wrote ''The Women of Aetna'', in honor of the city founded by Hieron. He also restaged his ''Persians''. < ref name=S33 / >  By 473 BC, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition. < ref name=S33 / >  In 458 BC, he returned to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of [[Gela]] where he died in 456 or 455 BC. It is said that he was killed by a [[tortoise]] which fell out of the sky after it was dropped by an [[eagle]]. This story is probably only a legend. < ref > See (e.g.) Lefkowitz 1981, 67ff. Cf. Sommerstein 2002, 33, who does not tell this story when giving a biographical sketch of the poet. < /ref >  Aeschylus' work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in future competitions. < ref name=S33 / >  His sons Euphorion and Euæon, and his nephew Philocles, all wrote plays as well. < ref name=S33 / > 
 
 == The plays ==

 [[Greek drama]] began with festivals for the gods, mainly [[Dionysus]], the god of wine. < ref name= " F241 " > {{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=241}} < /ref >  During Aeschylus' lifetime, dramatic competitions became part of the city's Dionysia in the spring. < ref name=F241 / >  The festival began with an opening procession, then a competition of boys singing [[dithyramb]]s, and finally two dramatic competitions. < ref name= " F242 " > {{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=242}} < /ref >  The first competition was for three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays, followed by a shorter comedy. < ref name=F242 / >  A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed, and winners of both competitions were chosen by a group of judges. < ref name=F242 / > 
 
 Aeschylus took part in many of these competitions in his lifetime. Only six tragedies have survived intact: ''[[The Persians]]'', ''[[Seven against Thebes]]'', ''[[The Suppliants]]'', and the trilogy known as ''[[The Oresteia]]'', consisting of the three tragedies ''[[Agamemnon (play)#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Libation Bearers]]'' and ''[[The Eumenides#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]''. There is also the play ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', but this was probably written by someone else. All of the surviving plays won first prize at the City Dionysia. One book, the Alexandrian ''Life of Aeschylus'', said that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia 13 times. Sophocles' won 18 times out of his 120 plays, and Euripides only had five wins out of about 90 plays.

 When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre was new. Some playwrights like [[Thespis]] had made the cast bigger to include an actor who was able to talk with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] instead of just the [[chorus]]. < ref name= " P222 " > {{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=222}} < /ref >  Aeschylus added a second actor, called the [[deuteragonist]] allowing for more drama; and the chorus became less important. < ref name=P222 / >  He is said to have been the first to use ''[[skenographia]]'', or scene-decoration, < ref > According to Vitruvius. See Summers 2007, 23. < /ref >  though Aristotle said the first person was Sophocles. Aeschylus also added more details to the costumes, and had his actors wear platform boots, called ''cothurni'', to help the audience see them better. When they walked on stage in the first performance of the ''Eumenides'', the chorus of Furies were so frightening in looks that they made young children [[faint]], old men [[urinate]], and [[pregnant]] women go into labor. < ref > ''Life of Aeschylus''. < /ref > 
 
 His plays were written in the strict style of Greek drama. They were in verse and no violence could be performed on stage. The plays had to be set away from normal life in Athens, either by telling stories about the gods or by being set, like ''The Persians'', in a far-away place. < ref name= " P223 " > {{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=223}} < /ref >  Aeschylus' work has a strong moral and religious [[wikt:emphasis|emphasis]]. < ref name=P223 / >  The ''Oresteia'' plays were about man's position in the universe in relation to the gods, the laws of the gods, and punishment from the gods. < ref > {{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|pp=224–225}} < /ref > 
 
 Fifty years after Aeschylus' death, the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]] praised him in ''[[The Frogs]]''. Aeschylus is a character in the play and says that his ''Seven against Thebes''  " made everyone watching it to love being warlike "  (line 1022); with his ''Persians'', he says he  " taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies "  (line 1026–7).  He says that his plays helped the Athenians to be brave and [[virtuous]] (line 1039ff).
