 '''''Rhododendron''''' is a large [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s. It includes 1,024 [[species]] of woody plants in the [[heath]] family (Ericaceae). Some are [[evergreen]], and some are [[deciduous]]. They are found mainly in [[Asia]].  
 
 Most of them have quite showy [[flower]]s. What [[Gardening|gardeners]] know as '''Azalea''' is in fact a kind of rhododendron. Many people have rhododendrons in their [[garden]] or flower pot. It is the national flower of [[Nepal]].  One rhododendron, ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]'', has become an [[Invasive species]] in [[North America]].
