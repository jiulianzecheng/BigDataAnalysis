 Compassion motivates people to go out of their way to help physical, [[spiritual]], or [[emotion]]al hurts or pains of another. The word “compassion” comes from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] to mean “to suffer with.” Compassion means to suffer with another, and it includes a spontaneous [[wikt:desire|desire]] to alleviate that suffering. < ref name=sjsl/ >  [[Pity]] and compassion are closely related words but have subtle differences. The difference is that compassion usually involves some [[wikt:commitment|commitment]] to help. Pity does not usually require any personal [[wikt:involve|involve]]ment. < ref > David Konstan, ''Pity Transformed'' (London: Duckworth, 2001), pp. 21–22 < /ref >
