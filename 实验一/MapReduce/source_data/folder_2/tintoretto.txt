 '''Tintoretto''' (1518 â€“ 31 May 1594), born '''Jacopo Comin''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painter. He was known by the nickname '''Il Furioso'''. His works are very [[drama]]tic, often depicting muscular figures and a bold use of [[perspective]]. These elements he paints in the [[Mannerist]] style. His use of colour and light, however, is typical of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]]. < ref > {{cite book|last=Zuffi|first=Stefano|title=One Thousand Years of Painting|year=2004|publisher=Electa|location=Milan, Italy|pages=427}} < /ref > 
 
 Tintoretto was from [[Venice]]. He spent most of his life painting there. He was a devout [[Roman Catholic]]. He painted [[fresco]]s and other [[mural]]s on the walls and ceilings of several churches and other buildings in Venice, such as the [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]]. His largest work is ''Il Paradiso'', which dominates the main hall of the Doge's Palace. It is 22.6 x 9.1 metres in size, and is said to be the largest painting ever done on [[canvas]].
