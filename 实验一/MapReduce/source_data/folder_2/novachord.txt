 The '''Novachord''' is what many people say is the first [[polyphonic]] [[synthesizer]]. It is completely [[electricity|electronic]]. It was designed by John M. Hanert, Laurens Hammond and C. N. Williams. It was then made by the [[Hammond organ|Hammond]] company. Only 1,069 Novachords were made between 1939 and 1942. < ref name= " cirocco " > {{cite web|last=Cirocco|first=Phil|title=The Novachord Restoration Project|url=http://www.discretesynthesizers.com/nova/intro.htm|year=2006|publisher=CIROCCO MODULAR SYNTHESIZERS|access-date=26 April 2011}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Manhattan '45|year=1998|publisher=JHU Press|pages=47}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|last=Davison|first=Annette|title=Alex North's A streetcar named Desire: a film score guide|url=https://archive.org/details/alexnorthsstreet0000davi|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alexnorthsstreet0000davi/page/82 82]}} < /ref >
