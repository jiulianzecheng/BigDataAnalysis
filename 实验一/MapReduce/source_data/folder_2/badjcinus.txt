 '''''Badjcinus''''' ( " expert hunter dog " ) was an animal that belonged to the extinct [[marsupial]] family [[Thylacinidae]]. 
 
 It was one of the most primitive members of its group, living 33 to 32 million years ago in the early [[Oligocene]]. It was quite small, averaging 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg) in weight. 
 
 Its diet probably consisted of small [[mammal]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[insect]]s. 
 
 Although ''Badjcinus'' was successful in its period, it probably was pushed out by other, better developed thylacinids. The fossils were found at [[Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh)|Riversleigh]] in north-west [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].
