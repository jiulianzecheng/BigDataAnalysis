'''Gossamer''' is an animated character in the [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series of cartoons. He is a large, hairy, orange monster. His body is perched on two giant tennis shoes, and his heart-shaped face is composed of only two oval eyes and a wide mouth, with two hulking arms ending in dirty, clawed fingers. The monster's main trait is his uncombed, orange hair. He was originally voiced by [[Mel Blanc]] and has been voiced by [[Frank Welker]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Jim Cummings]], Kwesi Boakye, [[Eric Bauza]] and currently [[Fred Tatasciore]].
