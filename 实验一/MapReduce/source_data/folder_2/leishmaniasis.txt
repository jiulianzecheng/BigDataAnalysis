It is spread by the bite of certain types of [[sandflies]]. < ref name=WHO2014/ > 
 
 The disease has three forms: < ref name=WHO2014 > {{cite web|title=Leishmaniasis Fact sheet N°375|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs375/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=17 February 2014|date=January 2014}} < /ref > < ref name=Barrett2012/ > 
 *'''Cutaneous leishmaniasis''': skin [[ulcer]]s 
 *'''Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis''':  ulcers of the skin, mouth and nose 
 *'''Visceral leishmaniasis''': starts with skin ulcers, then [[fever]], low [[red blood cell]]s, and a large [[spleen]] and [[liver]] 
 
 Leishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than 20 [[species]] of ''Leishmania''. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  [[Risk factor]]s include [[poverty]], [[malnutrition]], [[deforestation]] and urbanization. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  All three types can be [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] by identifying the parasites under a [[microscope]]. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The visceral form can be diagnosed with a [[blood test]]. < ref name=Barrett2012/ > 
 
 Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with [[insecticide]]. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies. Early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of ''Leishmania'' and the type of infection. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  [[Medication]]s used for the visceral form include: [[liposomal amphotericin B]], < ref name=Sun2013/ >  a combination of [[pentavalent antimonials]] and [[paromomycin]], < ref name=Sun2013 > {{cite journal|last=Sundar|first=S|author2=Chakravarty, J|title=Leishmaniasis: an update of current pharmacotherapy.|journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|date=Jan 2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=53–63|doi=10.1517/14656566.2013.755515|pmid=23256501|s2cid=207479873}} < /ref >  and [[miltefosine]]. < ref name=Dor2012 > {{cite journal|title=Miltefosine: a review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of leishmaniasis.|journal=The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|date=Nov 2012|volume=67|issue=11|pages=2576–97|doi=10.1093/jac/dks275|pmid=22833634|last1=Dorlo|first1=T.

 The parasites that cause the disease also infect other [[mammal]]s: The disease has been described in [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rodents]], [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s.  In addition to the mammal, the parasite needs an [[insect]] that spreads the parasite through its sting.  
 == Lifecycle of the parasite == 
 [[File:Leishmaniasis life cycle diagram en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Life cycle of ''Leishmania'']] 
 
 Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  These can transmit the infection ''[[Leishmania]]''. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals '''(1)'''.  Metacyclic [[promastigote]]s that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by [[macrophage]]s '''(2)''' and transform into [[amastigote]]s '''(3)'''.  Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], depending in part on which ''Leishmania'' species is involved '''(4)'''.  The differences in the type of tissue affected are responsible for the different visible types of leishmaniasis. Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes '''(5,6)'''.  In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes '''(7)''', which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the [[proboscis]] '''(8)'''. 
 
 The [[genome]]s of three ''Leishmania'' [[species]] have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite. ''Leishmania'' has unique features with respect to the regulation of [[gene expression]] in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for drugs and aid the development of [[vaccine]]s. < ref name= " Myler2008 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/171110678|title=Leishmania : after the genome|date=2008|publisher=Caister Academic|isbn=978-1-904455-28-8|location=Norfolk, UK|oclc=171110678}} < /ref >
