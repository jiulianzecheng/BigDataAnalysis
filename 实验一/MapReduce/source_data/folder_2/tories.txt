The '''Tories''' were one of the two political parties which existed in Britain from the 17th to the early 19th centuries. They were the opponents of the [[Whigs]], which were for a long time the ruling party. 
 
 The Tories were first part of the [[Parliament of England]], the [[legislature]] of the [[kingdom of England]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the Tories were part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom]]'s [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and after the [[Act of Union 1800]] they were part of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. 
 
 The Tories were originally (1678 to about 1770) the supporters of the [[Catholic]] kings (Charles I and II, James I and II), limiting the power of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and supporting freedoms for Catholics. < ref > Feiling, Keith. 1950.
