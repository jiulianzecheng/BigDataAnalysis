 '''Negroland''', or '''Nigritia''' was a term Europeans used to describe a region in [[Africa]], south of the [[Sahara]]. The region was poorly explored, and Europeans mainly knew the area around the coast. The name was probably a direct translation of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term  " Bilad al-Sudan " , which translates to  " land of the Blacks " . < ref name= " The Economist 2016 " > {{cite web | title=A world apart - Elite black America | website=The Economist | date=2016-08-04 | url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2016/08/04/a-world-apart | access-date=2019-08-01}} < /ref > 
 
 As can be seen on the map, Europeans of the time believed that the rivers [[River Senegal|Senegal]], [[River Gambia|Gambia]] and [[River Niger|Niger]] were in the same river system: one river that divided before flowing into the ocean.  < ref name= " Google Books " > {{cite web | title=The Negroland of the Arabs Examined and Explained | website=Google Books | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Negroland_of_the_Arabs_Examined_and.html?id=380NAAAAQAAJ | access-date=2019-08-01}} < /ref >   
 
 In 1823, approximately the same area was described as  " Nigritia "  on an American map published by  Fielding Lucus Jr. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~16~10078|title=A General Atlas Containing Distinct Maps Of all the Known Countries in the World, Constructed from the Latest Authority.
