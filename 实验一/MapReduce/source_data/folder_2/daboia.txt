 '''''Daboia''''' is an  [[Old World]] [[Venom (poison)|venom]]ous [[viper]]s. It was named after Patrick Russell (1726-1805). Patrick Russell was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] 
 herpetologist, who studied many [[India]]n [[snake]]s. The Russell's Viper is one of the four most venomous snakes in India, and it causes the most deaths of all the venomous snakes.{{nosources|date=May 2022}}  
 
 == Description== 
 Russell's vipers can grow up to the length of 166 centimeters (5.5 & nbsp;ft), but they are usually around the length of 120 centimeters (4 & nbsp;ft). The Russell's viper is usually dark yellow or brown in colour with many black spots. The viper is found in Asia. 
 
 Russell's Viper is found in open grassy and bushy areas, farmlands, coastal lowlands, [[plain]]s and [[hill]]s.  
 
 == Behavior== 
 The Russell's Viper is Terrestrial (lives on the ground) and is usually [[nocturnal]], but in cool weathers it is [[diurnal]]. When threaten it raises its head and makes a hissing noise which is said to be louder than other [[snake]]s. Their bite may sometimes be a simple snap, or sometimes the jaws hang on to the enemy for a few seconds. Adults are said to be slow and sluggish but when disturbed they become aggressive. Since of its aggressiveness and venom many [[animal]]s and people are scared of this [[snake]]. That is why another snake, [[Rough-scaled Sand Boa]], mimics the color pattern of the Russell's Viper so it looks like the Russell's Viper, but it is actually harmless. Adult's venom glands hold around 21–268 & nbsp;mg of venom, while young one's venom glands hold around 8–79 & nbsp;mg of venom. 
 
 === Feeding=== 
 The Russell's Viper eats [[rodent]]s such as [[rat]]s, [[mice]], and [[squirrel]]s, land [[crab]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[shrew]]s, [[scorpion]]s and other [[arthropod]]s. Young Russell's Vipers are said to be [[cannibal]]s, meaning they eat each other. 
 
 == Reproduction== 
 The Russell's Viper is [[viviparous]]: they give live birth. They mate early in the year and a female is [[pregnant]] for around six months before giving birth to her young in May to November, but usually in June or July. A female gives birth to around 20-40 young at a time, and the young are around 215-260 millimeters long when they are born. A Russell's Viper becomes mature after around 2–3 years. 
 
 == Subspecies== 
 Not including the nominate subspecies, the Indian Russell's Viper (''D. r. russelii''), there is only one subspecies, the [[Eastern Russell's Viper]] (''D. r. siamensis'').
