 '''Rock crawling''' is an extreme form of off-[[road]] driving. < ref name=Mead6.8 > Sue Mead, ''Rockcrawling'' (New York: Infobase Publishing, 2005), pp. 6â€“8 < /ref >  [[wikt:participant|Participants]] use [[vehicle]]s anywhere from [[wikt:stock#Adjective|stock]] to highly [[wikt:modify|modified]] to overcome [[wikt:obstacle|obstacle]]s (usually [[rock (geology)|rock]]s).  In rock crawling, drivers drive highly modified [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles such as [[truck]]s, [[Jeep]]s, and  " [[Buggy (automobile)|buggies]] "  over very harsh [[terrain]].  Driving locations include [[wikt:boulder|boulder]]s, [[Mountain|mountain foothills]], rock piles, mountain [[trail]]s, etc. 
 
 Rock crawling is about slow-speed, careful and precise driving, and high [[torque]] generated through large [[gear]] [[wikt:reduction|reduction]]s in the vehicle's [[drivetrain]].  Rock crawlers often drive up, down and across obstacles that would appear [[wikt:impassable|impassable]]. Most vehicles used to rock climb are primarily [[4x4]]s. 
 
 Rock crawling [[competition]]s range from local events to [[national]] series.  A rock crawling competition consists of [[obstacle course]]s that are about {{convert|100 to 200|yd}} long.  Each obstacle is set up with gates, similar to a [[ski]] course. Usually a spotter (person who guides the driver) helps the driver through hard obstacles. Spotters may also use a [[rope]] to help prevent a vehicle from tipping over. < ref > Patrick Hueller, ''Rock Crawling: Tearing It Up'' (Minneapolis, MN: Lerner Publications Company, 2014), p. 17 < /ref >   
 
 ==Rock crawling basics== 
 ===The vehicles===

 Vehicles commonly used include Jeep, [[Nissan Patrol]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser]], [[Land Rover]], [[Ford Bronco]], [[Suzuki Samurai]], [[International Harvester Scout]]. Also, vehicles like the [[Unimog|Mercedes Unimog]] due to its [[portal axle]]s and greatly increased ground clearance. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.proformance.com.au/#!portal-hubs-explained/c747 |title=Portal Hubs Explained {{!}} Do I need them? |publisher=Performance.com |access-date=12 May 2016}} < /ref >  These vehicles are outfitted with custom parts. Power is usually not an issue, as rock crawlers typically lower their [[gear ratio]]s in order to drive more slowly over obstacles without [[Stall (engine)|stalling the engine]]. These custom parts can include: 
 #locking [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]s 
 #taller off-road [[tires]] 
 #upgraded [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] 
 #[[four wheel steering]] 
 #[[roll cage]] for driver protection 
 #engine modifications for increased performance, mostly [[torque]] 
 #lowered [[Gear ratio|gearing]] in either or all of the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[transfer case]] (including often employing a second transfer case to reduce gearing even more), or axle differentials 
 #[[winch]]es < ref name=Mead6.8/ > 
 #body armour (rocker panels, tube fenders, etc.) 
 #[[beadlock]]s (locks tires to the rims for low tire pressures) 
 #long-travel [[shock absorbers]], drop shackles, spring-over conversions (to increase wheel travel), coil-over spring/shock combinations, and upgraded control arms 
 #[[portal axle]]s

 [[wikt:oversize|Oversize]]d, [[Atmospheric pressure|low-pressure]], [[Knobby tire|knobby]], [[Mud-terrain tyre|mud-terrain tires]] are used. Most vehicles have a low-geared [[transfer case]] to make the most [[torque]] in the low speeds used for rock crawling. [[Suspension (vehicle)|Suspension-wise]], rock crawling vehicles sometimes have [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] [[Suspension lift|lift kit]]s installed, raising the [[chassis]] and increasing suspension [[wikt:flexibility|flexibility]]. Highly modified rock crawling vehicles are less suitable for driving on roads and [[highway]]s. 
 
 Building a dedicated rock crawler can cost a lot of money. For rock crawling [[competition]]s, getting a [[sponsor]] can help to cover some of these costs.
