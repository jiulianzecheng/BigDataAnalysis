 '''''Geranium''''' is a group of [[flowering plant]]s. It is a [[genus]] with 422 [[species]]. ''Geranium'' [[Flower|flowers]] have five [[Petal|petals]]. The flowers can be coloured white, pink, purple or blue. Geraniums will grow in any [[soil]] that is not too wet. 
 
 Geraniums can be [[Annual plant|annual]], [[biennial]], or [[perennial]] [[Plant|plants]]. These plants are often called '''cranesbills'''. They are found in [[Temperateness|temperate]] areas of the world and the mountains of the [[tropics]], but mostly in the eastern part of the [[Mediterranean region]]. 
 
 Some [[caterpillar]]s eat geraniums. Several species of ''Geranium'' are [[gynodioecy|gynodioecious]]. < ref > Hessing, M.B. 1989.

 The species ''[[Geranium viscosissimum]]'' (sticky geranium) seems on the way to becoming [[carnivorous]]. 
 
 Sometimes members of the genus ''[[Pelargonium]]'' are also called geraniums. ''Pelargonium'' species are also grown as garden plants. Sometimes members of the ''Geranium'' genus are called  " hardy geraniums " , to tell them apart from ''Pelargonium''.
