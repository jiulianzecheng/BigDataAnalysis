In [[cryptography]], a '''keystream''' is a [[Stream (computing)|stream]] of [[Randomness|random]] or [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] characters that are combined with a [[plaintext]] message to produce an [[Encryption|encrypted]] message (the [[ciphertext]]). 
 
 The  " characters "  in the keystream can be [[bit]]s, [[byte]]s, [[numbers]] or actual [[Character (computing)|characters]] like A-Z depending on the usage case. 
 
 Usually each character in the keystream is either added, subtracted or [[Exclusive or|XORed]] with a character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, using [[modular arithmetic]]. 
 
 Keystreams are used in the [[one-time pad]] cipher and in most [[stream cipher]]s. [[Block cipher]]s can also be used to produce keystreams. For example, the CTR mode (also known as Integer Counter Mode (ICM)) is a [[Block cipher modes of operation|block mode]] that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher. 
 
 == Example == 
 
 In this simple example we will use only the English alphabet of 26 characters from a-z, therefore we will not encrypt numbers, commas, spaces and other symbols. As we have only 26 characters the random numbers in the keystream have to be at least between 0 and 25. 
 
 To encrypt we add the keystream numbers to the plaintext. And to decrypt we subtract the same keystream numbers from the ciphertext to get the plaintext. 
 
 If a ciphertext number becomes larger than 25 we wrap it to a value between 0-25. I.e. 26 becomes 0 and 27 becomes 1 and so on. (Such wrapping is called [[modular arithmetic]].) 
 
 Here the plaintext message  " attack at dawn "  is combined by addition with the keystream  " kjcngmlhylyu "  and produces the ciphertext  " kcvniwlabluh " .
