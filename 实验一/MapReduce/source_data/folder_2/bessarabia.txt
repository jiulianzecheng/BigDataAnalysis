 '''Bessarabia''' is the word for the [[area]] in [[Eastern Europe]] between Romania and Ukraine. It shares borders with [[Dniester River]] on the [[east]] and the [[Prut River]] on the [[west]].  
 
 During the 19th century it was sometimes part of Romania and sometimes in the [[Russian Empire]]. It was again part of Romania most of the first half of the [[20th century]]. The Soviet Union occupied the region after 1944. Today, most areas of Bessarabia belong to the [[Republic of Moldova]].
