 The [[phylum]] '''Aquificae''' is a diverse collection of [[bacteria]] that live in harsh environmental settings. They have been found in hot springs, sulfur pools, and thermal ocean vents. Members of the [[genus]] [[Aquifex]], for example, are productive in water between 85 and 95 Â°[[Celsius|C]]. They are the dominant members of most terrestrial neutral to alkaline hot springs above 60 degrees Celsius. They are autotrophs and are the primary carbon fixers in these environments. They are true bacteria ([[Domain (biology)|domain]] bacteria) as opposed to the other inhabitants of extreme environments, the [[Archaea]]. They are [[gram negative]].
