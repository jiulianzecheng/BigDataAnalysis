 '''Tromsdalstinden''' is a [[mountain]] in [[Tromsø Municipality]] in [[Norway]], with an [[elevation]] of 1,238 meters. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Tromsdalstinden is Tromsø's mountain top|url=https://nordnorge.com/en/aktivitet/tromsdalstinden-er-tromsos-mountain-top/|access-date=2023-03-17|website=Visit Northern Norway|language=en}} < /ref >  The [[mountain]] is located at the [[South|southern]] end of the [[Tromsdalen]] [[valley]], just [[southeast]] of the [[city]] of [[Tromsø]]. The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] name Tromsdalstinden means  " the [[Mountain|peak]] above [[Tromsdalen]], "  while the [[Sámi]] name is made up from the parts Sálaš and Oaivi, with the first word meaning a good [[hunting]] area, and the second meaning a rounded mountain without jagged peaks. 
 
 The [[mountain]] is a popular [[hiking]] destination and can be summited from the [[suburb]] [[Tromsdalen]] or from Ramfjorden. The slopes up are not technically difficult, though [[fog]] and [[rain]] can make the ascent complicated for those not familiar with the [[terrain]]. [[Skiing|Skiers]] usually take the [[Fjellheisen]] [[Cable car|aerial tramway]] to Mount Storsteinen and begin their ascent from there. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Fjellheisen Cable Car : Norway Travel Guide : Nordic Visitor|url=https://norway.nordicvisitor.com/travel-guide/attractions/north-norway/fjellheisen-tromso-cable-car/|access-date=2023-03-17|website=norway.nordicvisitor.com}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[2003]], plans to build an alpine [[skiing]] facility on the slopes of Tromsdalstinden for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] were proposed. However, this sparked immediate [[Protest|protests]] from some [[Sámi]] [[Activism|activists]] who claimed that Tromsdalstinden has been a [[Sámi]] sacred [[mountain]] since ancient times. The [[Sámi Parliament of Norway|Sami Parliament]] enacted a resolution declaring it a holy [[mountain]] in [[2004]], and the plans were discontinued. 
 
 While some argue that Tromsdalstinden was made a holy [[mountain]] in recent times as part of [[Sámi]] identity [[politics]], others believe that it has been [[sacred]] at one point before [[Christianization]]. The [[mountain]] bears the significant feature of a [[Custom|traditional]] [[sacred]] [[mountain]], dominating the [[landscape]] due to its [[shape]] and/or [[height]]. Although the classic [[Sámi]] religion is dead, the [[mountain]] remains of [[Culture|cultural significance]] to modern [[Sámi]], and their commitment to preserving it displays its intense [[Culture|cultural significance]] to their [[Ancestor|ancestors]].
