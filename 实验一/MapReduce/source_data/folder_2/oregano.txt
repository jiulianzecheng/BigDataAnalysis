 == Growing oregano for cooking == 
 [[File:Oregano.jpg|left|thumb|Oregano growing in a field.]] 
 The subspecies of oregano ''Origanum vulgare hirtum'' is an important herb. It is used for cooking, especially in  [[Turkish cuisine]] and [[Italian cuisine]]s. The leaves are used for cooking. 
 
 Oregano is often used for [[tomato]] [[sauce]]s, fried [[vegetable]]s and grilled meat. Together with [[basil]], it adds much to the special character of many Italian dishes. 
 
 Oregano is an ingredient needed for [[Turkish cuisine]]. It adds flavour to the [[Turkish choban salad]]. It can be used separately. It can also be added to the lemon-olive oil sauce that goes with almost every [[fish]] or meat [[barbecue]]s and some [[casserole]]s. 
 
 Oregano has an [[aroma]]tic, warm and slightly bitter taste. The taste varies in intensity; good quality is so strong that it almost numbs the tongue, but the cultivars adapted to colder climates have often unsatisfactory flavour. The influence of climate, season and soil on the composition of the essential oil is bigger than the difference between the various species. 
 
 The related species ''Origanum onites'' ([[Turkey]], [[Asia Minor]]) and ''O. heracleoticum'' ([[Italy]], [[Balkan peninsula]], [[West Asia]]) have similar flavours. A closely related plant is [[marjoram]] from Asia Minor. That plant has a completely different taste. This is  because [[phenolic compounds]] are missing in its essential oil. Some breeds show a flavour intermediate between oregano and marjoram. The Oregano plant is also commonly found in the mediterranean region, and the black sea.
