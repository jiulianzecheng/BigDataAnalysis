 An '''exoskeleton''' supports and protects an [[animal]]'s body from outside and not like  the internal [[endoskeleton]] - of, for example human beings - from inside.   
 
 Many [[invertebrate]] animals (such as shelled [[mollusks]]) have exoskeletons in the sense of external hard parts. But if one speaks of an exoskeleton one mostly means that of [[arthropod]]s (i.e. [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, [[myriapods]] and [[crustacean]]s).  
 
 Exoskeletons contain rigid and resistant components that fulfil a set of functional roles including protection, excretion, sensing, support, feeding and (for terrestrial organisms) acting as a barrier against desiccation. Exoskeletons first appeared in the fossil record about 550 million years ago, and their evolution has been seen as critical as a driving role in the [[Cambrian explosion]] of animals that took place after this time. 
 
 The exoskeleton ( [https://aduk.de/blog/what-is-an-exoskeleton-suit/ exoskeleton suit]) is a device intended to restore the lost motion functions of a person or other living being. The exoskeleton also serves to increase human muscle strength and range of motion by means of an external skeleton and drive elements.
