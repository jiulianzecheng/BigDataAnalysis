 '''''Ecchi''''' (from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] エッチ ''etchi'') is from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning  " lewd " ,  " sexy " ,  " pervert " , or  " naughty "  when used as an [[adjective]], or it can mean to have sex when it is used as a verb or noun.  The [[English language|English]] use of this word is usually used in [[manga]] and [[anime]], used when it has sexual content, such as not much clothing or nudity, but does not show sex.  
 
 Ecchi anime is also sometimes filled with [[innuendo]] and sexual humor. Ecchi anime doesn’t show sex, at least not in a clear way.  
 
 Ecchi is similar to [[hentai]], though it doesn’t go as far. The term itself may be from the word hentai, but the origins are unclear. Ecchi means “h”.  
 
 A character in anime is often called ecchi, or even hentai, when he is perceived as being a [[pervert]]. In an anime like [[Love Hina]] it’s usually because of a comedic mistake or blunder.
