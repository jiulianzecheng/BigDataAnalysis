 '''''Hyracotherium''''' was previously called  ''[[Eohippus]]'' (meaning  " dawn horse " ). It is a Eurasian species, a [[Palaeothere]]. That group is ancestral to the horses and [[brontothere]]s. < ref name=Froehlich > {{cite journal | author = Froehlich D.J. | year = 2002 | title = Quo vadis eohippus?

 ''Hyracotherium'' lived during the early [[Eocene]] epoch, about 55{{ndash}}45 million years ago. It lived in the [[northern hemisphere]] in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. The first fossils of this tiny animal were found in [[England]] by [[Richard Owen]] in 1841 and named ''Hyracotherium''. 
 
 The original [[type species]] ''H. leporinum'' is now regarded as an  ''Eohippus''. So that name has been brought back to describe the early proto-horse found in North America. < ref name=Froehlich/ >
