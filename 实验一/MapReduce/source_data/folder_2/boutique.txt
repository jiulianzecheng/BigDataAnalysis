 A '''boutique''' is a small [[shopping]] outlet, especially one that specializes in elite and fashionable items such as [[clothing]] and [[jewellery]]. The word is [[French language|French]] for  " shop " . < ref > [http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0096180#m_en_gb0096180 boutique] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919153127/http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0096180#m_en_gb0096180 |date=2010-09-19 }}, on Oxford Dictionaries < /ref > 
 
 " Boutique "  was an everyday English word in the late 1960s when, for a brief period, [[Swinging London]] was the centre of the fashion trade. < ref > Sandbrook, Dominic 2006.

 Today, boutique may refer to a specialised firm, such as a boutique [[investment]] [[bank]] or boutique [[law]] firm.  The word is often used to describe small private hotels, to distinguish them from larger chains (such as [[Hilton Hotels]]).  In such cases the term suggest their operation is elite and highly specialised. 
 
 In the strictest sense of the word, boutiques would be one-of-a-kind but some chains are referred to as boutiques if they specialize in particular styles. 
 
 Recently, the term  " boutique "  has started being applied to normally-mass-market items that are either niche or produced in intentionally small numbers at very high prices.  This may be referred to as boutique [[manufacturing]]. For example, a ''[[Time Magazine]]'' article suggested that [[Nintendo]] could become a  " boutique video-game company " , producing games for niche audiences, rather than trying to compete directly with [[Microsoft]] and [[Sony]]. < ref > {{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501031215-557120,00.html | work=Time | title=The Console Wars: Game On | date=December 8, 2003 | access-date=April 26, 2010 | first=Jim | last=Frederick | archive-date=June 16, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616020704/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501031215-557120,00.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >
