 The '''Magnificat''' is the song that [[Virgin Mary|the Virgin Mary]] sang after [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]] told her that she is going to give birth to [[God in Christianity|God's]] son.  This is the story told in the [[Bible]] in the book of Luke Chapter 1, verses 46-55. It is also known as the '''Song of Mary'''.  " Magnificat "  is a [[Latin]] word meaning  " magnifies "  (saying how great [God] is). 
 
 The words of the Magnificat have been set to music by many composers.  These musical settings were mostly written for church services.  In the [[Anglican Church]] it is always sung as part of the traditional evening service ([[Evensong]]). 
 
 Like all other [[New Testament]] texts the ''Magnificat'' was originally written in [[Koine Greek]], but in the Western Church it is most often to be found in Latin or the language of the country. 
 
 ==Text== 
 The Latin text from the [[Vulgate]] is as follows: 
 :Magnificat anima mea Dominum, 
 :et exsultavit spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo. 
 :Quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae.  
 :Ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes.	 
 :Quia fecit mihi magna, qui potens est, 
 :et sanctum nomen eius.  
 :Et misericordia eius a progenie in progenies  
 :timentibus eum. 
 :Fecit potentiam in brachio suo, 
 :dispersit superbos mente cordis sui.  
 :Deposuit potentes de sede  
 :et exaltavit humiles.  
 :Esurientes implevit bonis 
 :et divites dimisit inanes.	 
 :Suscepit Israel puerum suum,  
 :recordatus misericordiae suae.  
 :Sicut locutus est ad patres nostros,  
 :Abraham et semini eius in saecula. 
 :Gloria Patri et Filio  
 :et Spiritui Sancto,  
 :sicut erat in principio et nunc et semper  
 :et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. 
 
 
 The English words of the Magnificat in the traditional translation found in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'': 
 
 : My soul doth magnify the Lord : and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 
 : For he hath regarded : the lowliness of his handmaiden. 
 : For behold, from henceforth : all generations shall call me blessed. 
 : For he that is mighty hath magnified me : and holy is his Name. 
 : And his mercy is on them that fear him : throughout all generations. 
 : He hath shewed strength with his arm : he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. 
 : He hath put down the mighty from their seat : and hath exalted the humble and meek. 
 : He hath filled the hungry with good things : and the rich he hath sent empty away. 
 : He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel : as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed for ever. 
 
 
 The Magnificat (The soul rejoices in the Lord) found in the Roman Breviary

 : From this day all generations will call me blessed, 
 : the Almighty has done great things for me, 
 : and holy is his Name. 
 
 : He has mercy on those who fear Him 
 : in every generation. 
 
 : He has shown the strength of his arm, 
 : he has scattered the proud in their conceit. 
 
 : He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, 
 : and has lifted up the humble. 
 
 : He has filled the hungry with good things, 
 : and the rich he has sent away empty. 
 
 : He has come to the help of his servant Israel 
 : for he has remembered his promise of mercy, 
 : the promise he made to our fathers, 
 : to Abraham and his children for ever. 
 
 : Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
 : as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. 
 : Amen. Alleluia
