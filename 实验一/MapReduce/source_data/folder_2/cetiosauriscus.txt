 '''''Cetiosauriscus''''' is a [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived between 166 and 164 million years ago during the [[Middle Jurassic]] in what is now [[England]]. The fossil was originally confused with ''[[Cetiosaurus]]'', a similar sauropod.  < ref > Charig A.J. 1980. A diplodocid sauropod from the Lower Cretaceous of England. In Jacobs L.L.

 ''Cetiosauriscus'' was discovered in May 1898 by [[clay]] workers  south of [[Peterborough]] and east of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]. Pits in this region expose the fossil-rich [[sedimentary rocks]] of the [[ocean|marine]] [[Oxford Clay]], one of the classic [[geological formation]]s of British palaeontology. < ref name= " oxford_clay " > {{cite book |last=Smith |first=J.B. |editor1-last=Currie |editor1-first=P.J. |editor2-last=Padian |editor2-first=K. |title=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediadino00curr_075 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-12-226810-6 |chapter=Oxford Clay |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediadino00curr_075/page/509 509]–510}} < /ref >
