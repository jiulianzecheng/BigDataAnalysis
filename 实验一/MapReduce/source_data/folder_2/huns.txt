The '''Huns''' were an early group of [[Central Asia]]n [[equestrian]] nomads or semi-[[nomadic people]].  < ref > [[Walter Pohl]] has remarked  " early medieval peoples were far less homogeneous than often thought. They themselves shared the fundamental belief to be of common origin; and modern historians, for a long time, found no reason to think otherwise. "  (Walter Pohl,  " Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies "  ''Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings'', ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, p 16). In reviewing Joachim Werner's ''Beiträge zur Archäologie des Attila-Reiches'' (Munich 1956), in ''Speculum'' '''33'''.1 (January 1958), p 159, Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen noted with relief that  " the author is not concerned with the slightly infantile question, 'who' the Huns were; he does not ask where the Huns 'ultimately' came from. " < /ref >  They moved into [[Europe]] around 370, and in the 5th century, built an empire there under [[Attila the Hun]]. After Attila's death in 453, the empire fell apart.
