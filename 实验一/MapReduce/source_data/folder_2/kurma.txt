 [[File:Kurma avatara.jpg|thumb|Kurma avatar]] 
 '''Kurma''' is an [[avatar]] in the [[Hinduism|Hindu religion]]. Hindus believe that [[Vishnu]], an important god of Hinduism, had several forms, or [[avatar]]s, and the second 
 
 
 important avatar is called the Kurma avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu took the form of a kurma to help the devtas and asuras to churn the [[Kshira Sagara]], to gain amrita. This avatar took the Mount Mandaar on his back and helped the mount to churn the ocean. Kurma is a [[Sanskrit]] language word that means a [[tortoise]]. As a kurma, Vishnu is the symbol of strength and stability.
