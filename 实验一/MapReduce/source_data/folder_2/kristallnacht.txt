'''Kristallnacht''' (also called '''Reichskristallnacht''', '''Reichspogromnacht''', {{lang-en|Night of the Broken Glass}}) was a two-day [[pogrom]] that happened against [[Jews]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and parts of [[Austria]]. It was between 9 and 10 November 1938. At least one  thousand people were killed. However, [[servicemen]] of [[SS]] wrote a report that said that only 91 people were killed. < ref name=1000or2000 > Asbjørn Svarstad. https://www.nettavisen.no/norsk-debatt/vare-joder-er-nordmenn-ikke-israelere/o/5-95-1443876. [[Nettavisen]].no. Retrieved 2023-11-09 < /ref >  About 30,000 Jews were moved to [[concentration camp]]s, and over 1,500 [[synagogue]]s were pillaged and partly destroyed. Also, almost all Jewish [[cemetery|cemeteries]] in [[Germany]] and Austria were destroyed. This marked the change from [[discrimination|discriminating]] against Jews to actively [[persecution|persecuting]] and [[deportation|deporting]] them. 
 
 [[Herschel Grynszpan]] (sometimes also spelled ''Grünspan''), a 17-year-old Jew living in [[Paris]], learned that his whole family had been made to go back to [[Zsbaszyn]] in [[Poland]], even though the younger children had been born in Germany. He got a [[gun]], and with this he fired shots at [[Ernst Eduard vom Rath]], who was a [[secretary]] of the [[Germany|German]] [[embassy]] in Paris. This was on 7 November. Vom Rath died of his wounds on 9 November. 
 
 The motive of Grynszpan is unclear. In a judicial hearing in 1942, he said it was [[wikt:revenge|revenge]]. He meant to shoot the [[ambassador]], but hit the secretary instead. 
 
 The [[NSDAP]] used this event as an excuse to seize Jewish property. There had been a similar event in February 1936 but there were almost no consequences. Then, a Jewish student, [[David Frankfurter]], had fired shots at the NSDAP secretary [[Wilhelm Gustloff]]. At that time, the NSDAP could not act because of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]].
