 '''''Bagualosaurus '''''(from the Portuguese regional term  " bagual " , referring to a person or animal of strong build < ref > Flávio A. Pretto; Max C. Langer; Cesar L. Schultz 2018. A new dinosaur (Saurischia: Sauropodomorpha) from the Late Triassic of Brazil provides insights on the evolution of sauropodomorph body plan. ''Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society'' [doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zly028] < /ref > ) is a [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]] [[dinosaur]]. It is the seventh known sauropodomorph discovered in [[Brazil]]. It was described in 2018. < ref > Flávio A. Pretto; Max C. Langer; Cesar L. Schultz 2018.

 ''Bagualosaurus'' lived about 223{{ndash}}230 million years ago, and grew to about 2.5 meters (8.2 & nbsp;ft) long. 
 
 The [[holotype]] specimen had a partial skull and jaw, twelve back vertebrae, two tail vertebrae, two chevrons, a pelvis, two partial hindlimbs and five fragmentary ribs. The pieces were found on a ravine at the edge of a pond in rural Agudo in 2007.  
 
 The fossil had been kept in a closet of the Laboratory of Paleovertebrates of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul South. The fossil was described as a sauropodomorph on May 25, 2018. 
 
 == Paleoecology == 
 ''Bagualosaurus'' probably had a fully herbivorous diet. They had a [[dentition]] well adapted for eating vegetation. All sauropods have two characteristics in common: gigantism and herbivorism. Their diet may have been the source of later sauropod gigantism. Modern trees had not evolved, and herbivores at the time had [[cycads]], [[Fern|ferns]] and early [[Conifer|conifers]] as food. 
 
 ''Bagualosaurus'' lived in the Santa Maria Formation alongside animals such as the carnivorous sauropodomorph ''[[Buriolestes]]'',  the crocodile-like ''[[Cerritosaurus]]'' and the possible [[theropod]] ''[[Staurikosaurus]]''. < ref > Langer M.C; Ramezani J;  &  Da Rosa Á.A.S. 2018.
