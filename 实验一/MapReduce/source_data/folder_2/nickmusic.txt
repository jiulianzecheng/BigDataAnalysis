 '''NickMusic''' is an American [[pay television|pay]] [[television network]]. It is a [[spin-off]] of [[Nickelodeon]]. It mainly broadcasts [[music video]] and music-related programming from younger [[pop music|pop]] artists. Some videos are edited to meet a general [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-PG]] rating, or replaced with a [[lyric video]] instead. 
 
 == History == 
 The network was launched on May 1, 2002 as ''MTV Hits''. The network was named for a daily program on [[MTV]] also called ''MTV Hits''. It was MTV's main [[pop music]] video program. The network included current hit music videos, along with a few older videos from earlier in the year, as well as a few from the late 1990s. The network maintained a commercial-free format, other than internal promotions for MTV and MTV-branded properties. 
 
 In 2005, the network began airing a feature called  " My Hitlist Month " . It was based on viewer selected playlists that were submitted to a new network website. My Hitlist Month, along with artist-selected playlists, were broadcast occasionally on the network until 2006. 
 
 In 2016, MTV Hits was re-branded NickMusic.
