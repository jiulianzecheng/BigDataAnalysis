 A '''mousebird''' is one of a small group of [[bird]]s. They are not closely related to other groups of birds. Though they and the parrots and cockatoos ([[Psittaciformes]]) may be closer to each other than to other birds. The mousebirds are given [[order (biology)|order]] status as '''Coliiformes'''. This group only lives in sub-Saharan [[Africa]].  They had a wider range in prehistoric times and apparently [[evolution|evolve]]d in [[Europe]]. 
 
 ==Description== 
 
 They are slender greyish or brown birds with soft, hairlike body [[feathers]]. They are typically about 10 & nbsp;cm in body length.  They have a long, thin, tail a further 20–24 & nbsp;cm in length.  They weigh 45–55 & nbsp;grams. < ref name=EoB > {{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author=Cunningham-Van Someren, G.R.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher=Merehurst Press|location=London|pages=138–139|isbn=1-85391-186-0}} < /ref >  They are [[arboreal]] and scurry through the leaves like [[rodent]]s, in search of berries, fruit and buds. This habit, and their legs, is the reason for the group's [[English language|English]] name. They can feed upside down. They have [[Crest (feathers)|crests]] and stubby bills. 
 
 Mousebirds are very talkative.  They are found in bands of about twenty in lightly wooded country. 
 
 These birds build cup-shaped twig nests in trees, which are lined with grasses. 2–4 eggs are typically laid.
