 '''''Elasmosaurus''''' was a 46 [[foot (unit of length)|foot]] long [[swim]]ming [[reptile]] that lived in the [[North American Inland Sea]]. It was a [[plesiosaur]].  
 
 It was first discovered in 1868 by a [[scientist]] named Edward Drinker Cope who accidentally put the [[head]] on the [[tail]]. It had 71 [[cervical vertebrae]]. < ref > Sachs S. 2005. Redescription of ''Elasmosaurus platyurus'', Cope 1868 (Plesiosauria: Elasmosauridae) from the Upper Cretaceous (lower Campanian) of Kansas, U.S.A. ''Paludicola'' '''5'''(3): 92-106. < /ref >   
 
 It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that their method was as surface swimmers, mostly eating with their head above water, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on [[plankton]]. < ref > Watson D.M.S. 1951. ''Palaeontology and modern biology''. Yale, CT. < /ref > < ref > Watson D.M.S. 1958. ''Studies on fossil vertebrates''. London. < /ref > < ref > Alexander, R. McNeill 1989. ''Dynamics of dinosaurs and other extinct giants''. Columbia N.Y. p137 < /ref >  It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water. [[Aquatic]] [[mammal]]s operating under water all have a streamlined [[torpedo]]-shape, as did pliosaurs and [[ichthyosaur]]s. All the longer-necked families were, from the setting of the [[teeth]] and [[jaw]]s, eaters of small fish. The large number of neck vertebrae is probably linked to the modest degree of flexibility between adjacent vertebrae.
