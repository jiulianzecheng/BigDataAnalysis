 '''Khabarovsk''' ({{lang-ru|Хабаровск}}) is a city in and the [[Administrative centre|administrative center]] of [[Khabarovsk Krai]], [[Russia]]. It has 618,150 people as of 2018. 
 
 == History == 
 Khabarovsk is located at the [[Amur River]] just below the city's confluence with the Ussuri. Khabarovsk was named after E.P. Khabarov, who made several undertaken journeys to the [[Amur River]] basin in the mid-17th century. Khabarovsk was founded in May 31,1858 as a military outpost. Khabarovsk's nodal position at the point at which the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] crosses the Amur River made it an important focus of the [[Russian Far East]], and at one time it administered the entire area to the [[Bering Strait]], which connects [[Russia]] and [[North America]]. Modern Khabarovsk spreads across a series of small valleys and ridges perpendicular to the Amur. 
 
 Khabarovsk has an attractive waterfront park and long area and a mixture of modern apartment blocks, factories, and old, one-story wooden houses. It is a major industrial centre, with most enterprises located in the upstream district. They include large scale engineering and machine-building industries, oil refining, timber working, furniture making, and many light industries. 
 == Economy == 
 Khabarovsk has an institution of higher education, agricultural, medical, teacher-training, and railway-engineering institutes and several scientific-research establishments.
