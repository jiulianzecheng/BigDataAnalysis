 '''Ullsfjorden''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]) or ([[Sámi languages|Northern Sámi]]: {{lang|sme|Moskavuotna}}) is a [[fjord]] located in [[Troms og Finnmark]] county, [[Norway]]. It runs through the municipalities of [[Tromsø Municipality|Tromsø]], [[Karlsøy Municipality|Karlsøy]], and [[Lyngen Municipality|Lyngen]]. The fjord is {{convert|75|km}} long and flows northwards from the village of [[Sjøvassbotn]] along the west side of the [[Lyngen Peninsula]]. That is where the  [[Lyngen Alps]] are located. The Kjosen fjord branches off to the east side and the Grøtsundet strait branches off to the west which flows into the [[Tromsøysundet]]. Reinøya and Karlsøya islands lie along the fjord's western side. The southern part of the Ullsfjorden is also called Sørfjorden. The area surrounding the fjord was part of the municipality of Ullsfjord for about 60 years in the 20th century. < ref > {{Citation|last=Thorsnæs|first=Geir|title=Ullsfjorden|date=2023-01-25|url=https://snl.no/Ullsfjorden|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|language=no|access-date=2023-04-29}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ullsfjorden Essential Tips and Information|url=https://trek.zone/en/norway/places/492101/ullsfjorden|access-date=2023-04-29|website=Trek Zone|language=en}} < /ref >
