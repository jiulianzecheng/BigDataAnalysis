[[File:Baskets four styles.jpg|thumb|Four kinds of baskets.]] 
 A '''basket''' is a [[container]]. It is usually light in weight. 
 
 Basket makers use a wide variety of materials to create a basket, such as bark, willow rods, leaves, wire, plastic, paper, and rope.  There are three basic kinds of basketsâ€”coiled, twined, or woven.  A woven basket is made of spokes and weavers:  the spokes run up and down and the weavers go over and under the spokes. A coiled basket is made by sewing rings of a fibrous material to the previous ring. Twined baskets have flexible weavers that are twined around the spokes in a variety of patterns.  
 
 Basketmaking is a very old practice; it features in myths from various cultures. Baskets were often used to carry fruits, berries, and other things to be gathered. Nowadays, baskets are less practical but still common. Ancient baskets can be found in many cultures. Basket [[weaving]] is one of these activities, either for practical use or fun. In Native American culture, basket weaving is a common activity.
