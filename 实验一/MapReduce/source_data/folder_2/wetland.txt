 In [[Geography|physical geography]], a '''wetland''' is an [[environment]] that combines the properties of [[terrestrial ecoregion|land]] and [[Freshwater ecoregion|water]]. < ref > It is  " at the interface between truly [[terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] ecosystems and truly aquatic systems making them inherently different from each yet highly dependent on both " . Mitsch W.J. ''et al'' 2009. ''Wetland ecosystems''. New York: Wiley. < /ref >  Wetlands are a distinct kind of [[ecosystem]]. < ref > Maltby E.  &  Barker T. (eds) 2009. ''The wetlands handbook''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell. < /ref > 
 
 The combination of wet and dry areas means that many more different kinds of plants, animals and insects may live in a wetland than compared to other types of [[habitat]]. Because of this great [[biodiversity]], several important wetlands are among the [[Global 200]] [[ecoregion]]s that the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] listed for [[conservation]] to try to get people to protect them. As well, [[Ramsar Convention]] is adopted in 1971 for protection of wetland. 
 
 == Wetland types == 
 * A [[bog]] or [[muskeg]] is [[acid]]ic [[peat]] land (peat bog). 
 * A [[Moorland|moor]] was originally the same as a bog but has come to be associated with this soil type on hill-tops. 
 * A [[moss (habitat)|moss]] is a raised bog in [[Scotland]] 
 * A [[fen]] is a freshwater peat land with chemically [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (which roughly means [[alkali]]ne) ground water. This means that it contains a moderate or high proportion of [[hydroxyl]] ions ([[pH]] value greater than 7). 
 * A carr is a fen which has developed enough to support trees. It is a European term, mainly applied in the north of the UK. 
 * A fresh-water [[marsh|marsh's]] main feature is its openness, with only low-growing or  " emergent "  plants. It may feature [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[reed (plant)|reeds]], [[typha]]s, [[Cyperales|sedges]], and other herbaceous [[plant]]s (possibly with low-growing woody plants) in a context of shallow [[water]]. It is an open form of fen. [[The Fens]] in eastern England were just such a wetland. 
 * A coastal (salt)-[[marsh]] typically has very salty water, either directly from the ocean or a mixture of salt water and fresh water. Salt-marshes may be associated with [[Estuary|estuaries]] and along waterways between coastal [[barrier island]]s and the inner coast. The plants in this kind of marsh can range from reeds in mildly brackish (salty) water to especially hardy salt-grasses ([[salicornia]]) on otherwise bare marine mud. Many plants in salt-marshes have evolved to live in such salty conditions with special [[adaptation]]s. Salt-marshes may be converted to human use as [[pasture]] ([[salting]]) or for salt production ([[Sea salt|saltern]]). 
 * A [[swamp]] is wetland with more open water surface and deeper water than a marsh. In North America, 'swamp' is used for wetlands dominated by trees and woody bushes rather than grasses and low herbs. This distinction does not necessarily apply in other areas, for instance in [[Africa]] where swamps may be dominated by papyrus instead of trees. A swamp may also be described by the dominant plants growing in it. For example: A [[mangrove swamp]] or mangal is a salt or brackish water environment dominated by [[mangrove]] trees. A [[melaleuca|paperbark]] wetland is a fresh or brackish water environment dominated by the [[Melaleuca]] tree. 
 * A [[dambo]] is a shallow, grass-covered depression of central and southern Africa. It is waterlogged in the rainy season, and usually forms the headwaters of a stream or river. It is marshy at the edges and at the headwater, but maybe swampy in the centre and downstream. 
 * A [[bayou]] or [[slough (wetland)|slough]] are southern United States terms for a swamp with a creek running through it. In an Indian mangrove swamp, it would be called a [[Creek (tidal)|creek]]. 
 * A [[peat swamp forest]] is a low-level tropical or subtropical forest wetland. It produces peat, and is sometimes called a blackwater swamp. 
 * A [[constructed wetland]] is man-made to make a piece of land hold more water than it otherwise would naturally. This allows the land to stay wet enough to grow wetland plants and oftentimes hold water as well. Uses include absorbing [[flash flood]]s (by holding the extra water from the flood), cleaning [[sewage]] (which is done by the plants as the dirty water passes over their roots), enhancing [[wildlife]] [[habitat]] (for example creating new homes for rare birds or other animals) or for some other human reason.
