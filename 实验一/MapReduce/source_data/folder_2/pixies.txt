In 1988, they recorded a session with British [[radio]] [[DJ]] [[John Peel]] because he felt they were a good band. 
 
 The band had many problems, with band members disagreeing on certain issues. In 1989, the band nearly asked Kim Deal to leave because of her laziness. She was also trying to take more control as a songwriter. These problems got worse and in 1993, they split up.
