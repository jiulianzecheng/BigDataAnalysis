 {{Slavery}} 
 '''Cariye''' was the name given to [[slavery|enslaved]] women [[Concubinage|concubines]] in the  [[Islamic world]] of the [[Middle East]]. < ref name= " :0 " > Junius P. Rodriguez: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N70GiNB8aQ4C & dq=Cariye & pg=PA167 Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic]'' < /ref >  They were especially known from the [[Ottoman Empire]], where this title existed until the [[mid-]]19th century. 
 
 == General idea == 
 In general, a carie was a woman enslaved during [[warfare]]. In [[Islamic Law|Islamic law]], the enslavement of a woman was the only case where concubinage was permitted. 
 
 Such a woman had to obey her male owner, as she would have to obey her husband. < ref name= " :1 " > Madeline Zilfi: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oo_AetRkC9UC & dq=Cariyes & pg=PA223 Women and Slavery in the Late Ottoman Empire: The Design of Difference]'' < /ref >  The children, the caryie had with her master were born legally free. Because she was the mother of his children, her master could no longer sell her and she would be freed after his death. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Umm al-Walad|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803110601745|access-date=2021-10-21|website=Oxford Reference|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Ottoman Empire == 
 The {{Lang|tr|cariye}} system existed in the Ottoman Empire far into the 19th century and is most famous within the [[Ottoman Imperial Harem]] of the [[Ottoman court]]. It has often been translated to mean  " [[lady-in-waiting]] " . 
 
 The Ottoman system formally followed the original Islamic law, but varied from it in practice. After the Ottoman Empire had conquered most of the Middle East, and after the borders to Christian Europe had come to a standstill, there was in practice few opportunities to capture women through warfare. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 Because of the general ban for enslavement of Muslims, the non-Muslim {{Lang|tr|cariye}} was instead provided to the Ottoman slave market from Christian Europe through the [[Crimean slave trade]] and the [[Barbary slave trade]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Being from non-Muslim countries, with whom the Ottoman Empire could be regarded to be in passive warfare, this was regarded equivalent to enslaved prisoners of war, and thus was perceived to be in accordance with Islamic law. 
 
 When the Crimean slave trade was closed after the Russian conquest of the Crimea in 1783 (and the Barbary slave trade in the early 19th-century), the {{Lang|tr|cariye}} slave trade underwent yet another transformation. From this point on, a majority of the {{Lang|tr|cariye}} were Circassians from Caucasus, with a minor part coming from the [[white slave trade]]. While the Circassians were normally Muslim, the ban against the enslavement of Muslims was overlooked in their case, and their original Muslim status was an  " open secret " . < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 The {{Lang|tr|cariye}} was always regarded as sexually available for the master of the house, and if she bore a child by him, she could no longer be sold. < ref name= " :2 " > Fanny Davis, Sema Gurun, Mary E. Esch, Bruce Van Leer: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DTIrK0et4LwC & dq=Cariyes & pg=PA109 The Ottoman Lady: A Social History from 1718 to 1918]'' < /ref >  It was common for a {{Lang|tr|cariye}} to be freed ([[Manumission|manumitted]]). However, a manumission did not mean that a {{Lang|tr|cariye}} was free to simply leave the household. In a Muslim society based on [[gender segregation]], were women lived in seclusion, it was not a possibility for a manumitted woman to simply leave the house and walk about in the street, as a free unmarried woman without family would have no way to support herself. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  Instead, the manumission of a woman normally meant that a marriage was arranged for her; often, a male who freed a woman married her himself, or arranged for her to be married to another man. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 There was a difference between women bought to be domestic servants of Muslim women, and women bought by men; the slave women who were formally the property of a Muslim woman, although legally available for the master of the house, could also be sold by her female owner. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 In the first half of the 19th century, slavery had come to be regarded as morally wrong in the Western world. The liberal Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]], who was affected by these views, included anti-slavery laws among his Westernized reforms, and formally banned the {{Lang|tr|cariye}} slavery system. This was, however, a formal ban, and in reality, the {{Lang|tr|cariye}} continued informally until the end of the 19th century. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
