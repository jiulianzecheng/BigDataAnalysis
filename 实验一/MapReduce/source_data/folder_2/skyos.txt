 '''SkyOS''' is a privately owned [[operating system]] currently in production. SkyOS is mostly [[POSIX]]-compliant. It comes with the core of the open source [[GNU]] tools, including [[GCC]]. 
 
 Due to its level of POSIX-compliance and port of the GTK+ widget toolkit, many [[Linux]] or other [[UNIX]] applications have been ported, including [[AbiWord]] and Gaim, as well as a few games, such as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''. 
 
 It was made by Robert Szeleney.
