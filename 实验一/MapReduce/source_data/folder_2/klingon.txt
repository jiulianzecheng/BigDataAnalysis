 '''Klingons''' ({{lang-tlh|tlhIngan}}; Pronunciation: /ˈt͡ɬɪŋɑn/) are a warrior race in the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. They were in the show ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' (TOS) many times and were in all five spin-off series afterwards, eventually becoming friends of the United Federation of Planets.  
 
 Made by writer Gene Coon, Klingons were introduced in the episode  " Errand of Mercy "  (1967). They were named for Lieutenant Wilbur Clingan, who served with ''Star Trek'' creator Gene Roddenberry in the Los Angeles Police Department. < ref name= " STC " > {{ cite book | last = Alexander | first = David | year = 1994 | title = Star Trek Creator | isbn = 9780451454188 | url = https://archive.org/details/startrekcreatora00alex }} < /ref >   
 
 In the first series, the conflict between the Federation and Klingon was supposed to be referring to the then-current [[Cold War]] unfriendliness between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. < ref name= " Westmore " > {{cite book | author = Westmore, Michael; Alan Sims, Bradley M.
