Clear cutting refers to a method of [[logging]] or cutting down trees where an entire area of forest is completely cleared. It involves removing all the trees in a given area, leaving no trees standing. This method is often used in commercial logging operations to extract timber quickly and efficiently.

 When clear cutting is carried out, all the trees are cut down, including both mature and young trees. This practice results in a significant loss of forest cover and biodiversity. It also disrupts the natural ecosystem by removing the habitat of many plant and animal species that depend on the forest for survival. 
 
 While clear cutting can be a cost-effective way to harvest timber, it has several negative impacts on the environment. It can lead to soil erosion, as the roots of trees that previously held the soil in place are no longer there. This can result in the degradation of water quality in nearby streams and rivers. Clear cutting also contributes to climate change by reducing the forest's ability to absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. 
 
 In simple terms, clear cutting means cutting down all the trees in an area, which has harmful effects on the environment and the creatures that live there.
