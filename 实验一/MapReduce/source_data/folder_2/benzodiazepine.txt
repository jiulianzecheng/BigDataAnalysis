 '''Benzodiazepines''' are [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[chemical substance]]s, made of two carbon rings. Certain benzodiazepines can be used as [[drug]]s that increase the effect of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[GABA]]. The resulting drug has [[sedative]] effects. Depending on the drug, the effect may be stronger or weaker. The first benzodiazepine, [[chlordiazepoxide]] ([[Librium]]), was discovered accidentally by [[Leo Sternbach]] in 1955, and made available in 1960 by the medicine company [[Hoffmann–La Roche]]. 
 
 In general taking benzodiazepines is safe and effective in the short term. Longer term use is [[controversy|controversial]]: In the long term, the drug may become less effective and problems of dependency may show.  
 
 Benzodiazepines may not be safe to be taken during [[pregnancy]]. They are not [[teratogen]]s, which cause birth defects, but they may cause [[cleft palate]] in a small number of babies. Benzodiazepines can be taken in [[overdose]]s and can cause dangerous [[coma|deep unconsciousness]]. However, they are much less [[toxic]] than the drugs they replaced, the [[barbiturate]]s. Death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other [[central nervous system depressants]] such as [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[opiates]], the potential for toxicity increases. < ref name= " pmid9780123 " > {{cite journal |author=Fraser AD |title=Use and abuse of the benzodiazepines |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=481–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9780123 |doi=10.1097/00007691-199810000-00007 |pmc=2536139 }} < /ref >  Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other [[Drug abuse|drugs of abuse]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Benzodiazepine Addiction|url=https://recoveryfirst.org/benzodiazepines/|access-date=2021-04-10|website=Recovery First Treatment Center}} < /ref > < ref name= " Charlson_2009 " > {{cite journal |author=Charlson F, Degenhardt L, McLaren J, Hall W, Lynskey M |title=A systematic review of research examining benzodiazepine-related mortality |journal=Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=93–103 |year=2009 |pmid=19125401 |doi=10.1002/pds.1694 |s2cid=20125264 }} < /ref > < ref name= " pmid10779253 " > {{cite journal |author=Longo LP, Johnson B |title=Addiction: Part I.

 == Benzodiazepine effects  &  withdrawal symptoms == 
 Benzodiazepines affect the [[central nervous system]], increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter known as GABA. This results in a person experiencing a sensation of calmness and sedation, resulting in feeling more relaxed, less anxious, and increased drowsiness. When people use benzodiazepines, even under a doctor’s care, they can develop a tolerance, which means that they will require increasingly larger doses to achieve the desired effects. With escalating use and at higher doses, a person may find that they require the drug to feel and function normally. This indicates the development of dependence which, once established, may result in a person experiencing symptoms of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last1=April 16|first1=Scot ThomasLast updated on|last2=2021|title=Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Guide|url=https://withdrawal.net/benzodiazepine/|access-date=2021-05-18|website=Withdrawal|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Long-term, compulsive, or otherwise problematic use of benzodiazepines can lead to significant physical dependence and a higher risk of experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, which may include [[Seizure|seizures]] and [[Hallucination|hallucinations]]. Supervised medical treatment is usually recommended for people who are undergoing benzodiazepine withdrawal after a period of consistent use.
