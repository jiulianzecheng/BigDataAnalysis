 '''Fabrosauridae''' is a proposed family of primitive [[ornithischia]]n [[dinosaur]]s from late [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]]. The proposed  " Fabrosaurs "  descended from a ''[[Lesothosaurus]]''-like animal. The group is not established; it appears to be [[polyphyletic]], and its members may come from several other better-known groups.
