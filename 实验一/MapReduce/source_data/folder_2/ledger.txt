A '''ledger''' is a book or computer file that helps keep track of how much of something, usually money, that a person or group of people have. A ledger is often used in [[accounting]] to keep track of money you owe or money that is owed to you. 
 
 The three types of ledgers are the general, debtors, and creditors. The general ledger accumulates information from journals. Each month all journals are totaled and posted to the General Ledger.
