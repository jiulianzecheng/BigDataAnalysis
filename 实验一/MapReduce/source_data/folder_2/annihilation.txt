 {{Antimatter}} 
 
 '''Annihilation''' is the name given to the process that occurs when a [[particle]] and its [[antiparticle]] equivalent collide. The collision between these two particles makes energy release. Two types of this include the annihilation of [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s (the antiparticle for electrons), and the annihilation of [[proton]]s and [[antiproton]]s.
