 '''Athena''' is the Greek [[gods|goddess]] of [[wisdom]], warfare, handiwork, and [[strategy]]. She is one of the [[Twelve Olympians]]. Athena's symbol is the [[owl]], the wisest of the birds. She also had a [[shield]] called [[Aegis]], which was a gift given to her by [[Zeus]]. She is usually shown wearing her [[helmet]] and often with her [[shield]]. The shield later had [[Medusa|Medusa's]] head on it; after [[Perseus]] killed her, he gave the head of Medusa to Athena for safekeeping and she put the head on her shield.  
 
 Athena is the protector of [[Athens]], [[Greece]], a city named after her. The [[Parthenon]], which is on the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, is her most famous [[temple]]. She also helped many [[hero]]es, including [[Heracles]], [[Jason]], and [[Odysseus]], and is always seen with [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of [[victory]]. 
 
 == Birth  == 
 There are many stories about Athena's birth. In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Zeus married [[Metis]], but soon after, Zeus was scared of her giving birth to a child because the [[Oracle of Delphi]] had said that she will give birth to Athena, and a son that would overthrow Zeus, just like Zeus overthrew [[Kronos]], who overthrew his father [[Uranos|Uranus]].  
 
 To stop Metis giving birth to her son, Zeus made a plan.  He played a game with Metis, they shape shifted into different animals, Metis turned turned into a fly, Zeus saw his chance and he swallowed her whole.  Zeus was too late, as Metis was already [[pregnant]]. 
 
 While she was inside Zeus's head, [[Metis]] made a helmet, [[armor]], and a [[robe]] for Athena.  The hammering noise caused Zeus to have a severe [[headache]].  The headache became worse.  Hephaestus split his head open and Athena came out full grown and with armor on.
