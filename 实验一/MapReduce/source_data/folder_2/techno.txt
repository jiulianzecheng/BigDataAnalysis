 ==Usage of the term== 
 The word  " techno "  comes from  " [[technology]] " . Fans of Techno music are careful in their use of the word. They are careful not to confuse it with other types of music that are similar but different (for example [[house music|house]], [[trance music|trance]], [[Trap music|trap]]). At the same time, the word  " techno "  is commonly used when talking about all forms of electronic music and [[dance music]], especially in [[Europe]], the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]]. Despite the common usage of the term to refer to all electronic dance in general, techno is a specific genre with its own, distinguishable sound. By nature, techno tends to be highly repetitive, instrumentally-oriented music which follows a regular four-on-the-floor beat. The genre places a strong emphasis on rhythm, and techno tends to have a very beat-based sound.
