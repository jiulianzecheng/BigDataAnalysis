'''Cephalosporins''' are a type of group of [[antibiotics]], which come from a [[fungus]] of the genus Acremonium. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of CEPHALOSPORIN|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cephalosporin|access-date=2023-07-01|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref >  Since their discovery, they have been frequently used in medicine as an effective treatment for a wide range of [[Bacteria|bacterial]] infections. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last=Cornaglia|first=G.|date=2000|title=Cephalosporins: a microbiological update|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2000.tb02039.x|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|volume=6|pages=41â€“45|doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2000.tb02039.x|issn=1198-743X}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 Cephalosporins were first developed from a fungus, ''Cephalosporin acremonium'', found in 1945. 
 
 Giuseppe Brotzu, a [[pharmacologist]] working in [[Cagliari]], Italy, found the fungus while trying to make a map of places affected by the disease [[Typhoid Fever|typhoid fever]]. This fungus appeared in sewage water from locations where fewer people were becoming ill from the disease. 
 
 Scientists at the University of Oxford were able to extract molecules from the fungus, to research and develop the first generation of these antibiotics during the late 1940s and the 1950s. These first became commercially available in 1964. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last=Bhide, Datar, and Stebbins|first=Amar, Srikant, and Katherine|date=2020-08-24|title=Case Histories of Significant Medical Advances: Cephalosporins|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3679640|journal=Harvard Business School General Management Unit Working Paper No. 20-133}} < /ref > 
 
 == Structure and characterization == 
 The first cephalosporins antibiotics were produced from a molecule called 'cephalosporin C', obtained from the ''Cephalosporin acremonium'' fungus. The molecule consists of two rings, each with a chain. 
 
 Second-generation cephalosporins were developed from first-generation cephalosporins, because of a need for more effective treatments against the increasing number of [[Antibiotic resistance|bacteria developing resistance]] to other antibiotics. 
 
 Third-generation cephalosporins are improved versions of the second-generation, as they are broad-spectrum antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can be used against bacteria with or without protective [[Membrane|membranes]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Mechanism == 
 Cephalosporins work by attaching themselves to specific [[Enzyme|enzymes]] after the bacteria divide and duplicate. These enzymes are known as 'penicillin binding proteins' and are responsible for repairing the [[cell wall]] of bacteria. This leaves a gap in the bacterial cell wall, and results in the [[osmotic pressure]] inside a bacterium to build up. Bacteria can no longer survive if the osmotic pressure becomes too high. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Shahbaz|first=Kiran|date=2017-12-03|title=Cephalosporins: pharmacology and chemistry|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321537458_Cephalosporins_pharmacology_and_chemistry|journal=Pharmaceutical and Biological Evaluations|volume=4|issue=6|pages=234|doi=10.26510/2394-0859.pbe.2017.36|issn=2394-0859}} < /ref > 
 
 == Medical and scientific use == 
 Cephalosporins are an effective treatment against bacteria which are [[Gram-positive]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Some examples of Gram-positive bacterial infections are [[meningitis]] and [[pneumonia]]. < ref > {{Citation|last=Sizar|first=Omeed|title=Gram-Positive Bacteria|date=2023|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470553/|work=StatPearls|place=Treasure Island (FL)|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29261915|access-date=2023-07-19|last2=Leslie|first2=Stephen W.|last3=Unakal|first3=Chandrashekhar G.}} < /ref >  Third-generation cephalosporins play an important role in treating such illnesses. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 From the 1960s to the 1990s, cephalosporins played a particularly significant role in US hospitals. They were used to treat patients affected by bacteria infections after operations, and this rate of infection was cut down by over 50%. < ref name= " :1 "  / >
