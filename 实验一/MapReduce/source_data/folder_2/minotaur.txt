 == Etymology == 
 The word minotaur derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] Μῑνώταυρος, a combination of the name Minos and the noun bull, which translated as The Bull of Minos. In Crete, the Minotaur was known by the name Asterion, a name shared with Minos' foster-father. < ref > Pausanias, description of Greece '''2'''. 31. 1 < /ref >
