 '''Derogation''' ([[Latin]] ''derogatio'') is the relaxation or exemption from of a rule of [[law]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/derogation |title=Derogation |website=Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=28 July 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  This is as opposed to a [[repeal]] or ending of a law.  The term is used in both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]].  It is sometimes used, loosely, to mean [[abrogation]]. For [[example]] in the legal maxim: ''Lex posterior derogat priori'' which means a more recent law may overrule an earlier law. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~rjb3v/latin.html |title= " Beck's Law Dictionary " : A Compendium of International Law Terms and Phrases |publisher=Robert J. Beck/University of Virginia |access-date=16 November 2015}} < /ref >  Derogation is different from [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]] (an [[Wikt:exception|exception]] to a law) in that it applies to the law. A dispensation applies to specific people who are affected by the law. 
 
 In terms of [[European Union]] [[legislation]], a derogation can also [[Implication and inference|imply]] that a member [[state]] delays putting into effect a part of an [[European Union]] [[Law|regulation]] (etc.) into their own legal system. < ref > [http://esharp.eu/jargon/derogation/ Derogation â€“ EU Jargon] < /ref >  This can be for a period of time such as five years. Or that a member state has decided not to enforce a specific provision in a [[treaty]] due to internal circumstances (typically a state of emergency). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.geneva-academy.ch/RULAC/derogation_from_human_rights_treaties_in_situations_of_emergency.php |title=Derogation from human rights treaties in situations of emergency |publisher=Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights |access-date=16 November 2015}} < /ref >
