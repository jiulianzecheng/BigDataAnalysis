 '''Kingsnakes''' are [[Colubridae|colubrid]] [[snake]]s. They are members of the [[genus]] ''[[Lampropeltis]]'', which include [[milk snake]]s and four other [[species]]. There are many [[subspecies]], and experts differ on their classification. These snakes are mostly found in [[North America]] and [[Central America]]. 
 
 They use constriction to kill their prey. They prey on other snakes, including [[venomous]] snakes. They are immune to the venom. They also eat [[lizard]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s. < ref name= " Conant1975 " > Conant R. 1975.

 Their colouration is an example of [[Batesian mimicry]], because it is very similar to venomous [[coral snake]]s living in the same areas. This gives the kingsnakes protection from the birds which prey on them. < ref > Kikuchi, David W.  &  Pfennig, David W. 2010. Predator cognition permits imperfect coral snake mimicry.
