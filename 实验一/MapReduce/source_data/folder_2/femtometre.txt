The '''femtometre''' is a unit used to measure length in the [[metric system]], represented by the symbol '''fm'''. It is equal to one quadrillionth of a [[meter]]: 10 < sup > -15 < /sup >  m, or 1 m / 1,000,000,000,000,000. It is also called a '''fermi''', named after [[Enrico Fermi]]. 1 femtometre is equal to 0.001 [[picometre]]s or 1000 attometres. 
 
 1 femtometre is similar in size to a [[proton]] or [[neutron]].
