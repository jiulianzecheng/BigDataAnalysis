'''Monkeypox''' is an [[infectious disease]] caused by the [[monkeypox virus]] that can happen in certain animals, including humans. < ref name=CDC2015About > {{cite web |title=About Monkeypox |url=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/about.html |website=CDC |access-date=15 October 2017 |language=en-us |date=11 May 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015202400/https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/about.html |archive-date=15 October 2017 }} < /ref >  Symptoms begin with [[fever]], [[headache]], muscle pains, [[swollen]] [[lymph nodes]], and feeling tired. This is followed by a rash that forms [[blisters]] and forms a hard layer. The time from exposure to feeling these symptoms is around 10 days. The duration of symptoms is typically two to four weeks. < ref name=CDC2017Sym > {{cite web |title=Signs and Symptoms Monkeypox |url=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html |website=CDC |access-date=15 October 2017 |language=en-us |date=11 May 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015202514/https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html |archive-date=15 October 2017 }} < /ref > 
 
 Monkeypox was first identified in 1958 among laboratory [[monkey]]s in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. < ref name=CDC2015Main > {{cite web |title=Monkeypox |url=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/index.html |website=CDC |access-date=15 October 2017 |language=en-us |date=11 May 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015113128/https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/index.html|archive-date=15 October 2017 }} < /ref >  Monkeys are, however, not a natural carrier of the virus. The first cases in humans were found in 1970 in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. 
 
 The [[2022 monkeypox outbreak]] is the index case of widespread [[community transmission]] outside of Africa, which began in the [[United Kingdom]] in May 2022, with more cases confirmed in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australia]]. < ref > {{cite news |title=Monkeypox cases investigated in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2022 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61506562 |access-date=20 May 2022}} < /ref >
