 [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]: Αυτοκράτορας Καίσαρ Φωκάς Αύγουστος|birth_date=c. 547|mother=[[Domentzia]]|title=[[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor of the Romans]]}}Phocas ([[Medieval Latin|Latin]]: Focas; [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] Φωκάς c. 547 - 5 October 610) Was a [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] from 23 November 602 - 5 October 610. Phocas was a middle ranking officer within the ranks of the East Roman Army. He rose to power when a group of angry soldiers in 602 proclaimed him Emperor after deposing [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]]. 
 
 Phocas deeply mistrusted basically everyone especially the elites in [[Constantinople]] as he knew he was just a usurper and didn't have any connections with anyone. As soon as he became emperor, Sasanian Emperor [[Khosrow II (emperor)|Khosrow II]] used this as an excuse to invade the Eastern Roman Empire which at a time was facing troubles internally and elsewhere which would spark the beggining of a 2 decade long Roman-Persian War which would prove to be a disaster not only to the Persians but Also the Eastern Roman Empire.
