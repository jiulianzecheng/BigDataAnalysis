 '''Biedermeier''' was a time in [[the arts]] and [[German literature]], which occurred between 1815 and 1848. In 1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] ended the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1848, there were [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions]] in many European Countries. Between 1815 and 1848, the [[middle class]] grew. During that time, the forces that had been active before the [[French Revolution]] rose to power again. Politically, the times were very hard, and there was a lot of repression. For this reason, most of the arts focused on apolitical life at home.  
 
 In [[painting]], ''Biedermeier'' focused on landscapes, portraits, and perhaps still lifes, or genre paintings. There are almost no religious or historical paintings. Many painters wanted to copy or to resemble [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th century Dutch painters]]. Many paintings were realist, almost like a modern-day photograph. [[Interior portrait]]s were typical for Biedermeier: there the idea was to show a fully furnished room, in all its details. 
 
 In [[music]], there's no epoch called ''Biedermeier'': the only thing that is perhaps worth mentioning that playing music at home, in the family became important, this is known as [[house concert]]. 
 
 In [[theatre]], the main focus was entertainment, not like the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Also in addition to the national theatres, a number of smaller theatres started to exist.
