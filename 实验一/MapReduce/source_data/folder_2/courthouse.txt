 A '''courthouse''' is a building that holds a [[court]]. Some courthouses also have offices for the [[prosecutor]] and prosecutor's assistants. In small cities, some courthouses have other offices for local [[government]] officials. The term is common in North America while in most other English-speaking countries, they are simply called  " courts "  or  " court buildings " . In most of continental Europe and former non-English-speaking European colonies, the equivalent term is a '''palace of justice'''
