 A '''fly''' ([[plural]]: ''flies'') is an [[insect]] of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Diptera]]. < ref > from the Greek di = two, and ptera = wings < /ref >  The Diptera is a large [[order (biology)|order]] of advanced flying insects. 
 
 Their most obvious difference from other insects is in their flight. A normal fly has two flight wings on its [[thorax]] and a pair of [[halteres]]. The halteres, which [[evolved]] from the hind wings, act as flight sensors: they are balance organs. Also flies have large [[Eye|eyes]] with excellent wide-angle vision. 
 
 With the help of their eyes and halteres, flies are exceptional fliers. They can avoid most [[predators]], and are among the hardest insects to capture by hand. Their jinks, dives and turns to avoid their predators is their main [[adaptation]]. < ref name=BBC > Ghosh, Pallab 2014. Flies can manoeuvre like fighter jets. '''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26943442] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221206001044/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26943442 |date=2022-12-06 }} < /ref >   " These flies do a precise and fast calculation to avoid a specific threat and they are doing it using a brain that is as small as a grain of salt " ....  " And they can fly like an ace at birth. It's like putting a newborn baby in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft and it knowing what to do " . < ref name=BBC/ > 
 
 The only other order of insects bearing two true, working wings plus any form of halteres are the [[Strepsiptera]], a small order of insects. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera evolved their halteres from their front wings and their flight wings are their rear wings. 
 
 The presence of a single pair of wings distinguishes true flies from other insects with  " fly "  in their name, such as [[mayfly|mayflies]], [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], [[damselfly|damselflies]], [[stonefly|stoneflies]], [[whitefly|whiteflies]], [[firefly|fireflies]], [[sawfly|sawflies]], [[caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[butterfly|butterflies]] or [[scorpionfly|scorpionflies]]. 
 
 Some true flies have become secondarily wingless, including some that live in social insect [[Colony (biology)|colonies]]. 
 
 == Life cycle == 
 Flies are also [[holometabolous]], with complete [[metamorphosis]]. This means their eggs turn into grubs, which eat voratious. Then they turn into pupae. Their bodies change while they are in the pupa. 
 
 == Kinds of flies == 
 There are an estimated 1,000,000 species, although only about 150,000 species have been described. < ref name=Mayhew > Mayhew, Peter J. 2007. Why are there so many insect species? Perspectives from fossils and phylogenies. ''Biological Reviews''. '''82''' (3): 425–454. doi:10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00018.x. PMID 17624962. < /ref > 
 
 There are many different kinds of flies. Scientists have named 125,000 kinds ([[species]]). < ref name=Mayhew/ > 
 * [[Housefly|Houseflies]] are grey or black and can be found wherever people are. 
 * [[Horse fly|Horse flies]] and [[deer fly|deer flies]] can bite people and animals. 
 * [[Drosophila|Fruit flies]] can be found near [[fruit]] that is too ripe. 
 * [[Hover fly|Hoverflies]] look like small [[wasp]]s, but they have no sting. 
 
 Some flies do not have the word ''fly'' in their name, so people may not know they are flies.  
 * [[Mosquito]]es are flies that bite people and can carry [[disease]]s, such as [[malaria]]. 
 * [[Midge]]s are small flies, a bit like like mosquitoes, but not all midges bite. 
 * [[Gnat]]s are small flies that sometimes are in big groups called ''swarm''s. 
 
 Some insects have the word ''fly'' in their names, but they are not flies at all. 
 * [[Firefly|Fireflies]] are a kind of [[beetle]] that can make light. 
 * [[Dragonfly|Dragonflies]] and [[damselfly|damselflies]] are from the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Odonata]] and are not flies.
