 '''Riodinidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[butterfly|butterflies]].  They are commonly known as '''riodinids''' or '''metalmarks'''. Metalmarks get their name from the bright, metallic (looking like metal) markings found on the [[wing]]s of most [[species]]. < ref name=jpbkk > Jim P. Brock and Kenn Kaufman (2003). ''Butterflies of North America.'' Houghton Mifflin, New York, NY. {{ISBN|0-618-15312-8}} < /ref >  The family has nearly 2,000 species in it. The metalmarks are mostly found in the [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropical region]]. Most metalmarks are small. Their [[wingspan]] ranges from 20mm to 65mm. Metalmarks vary greatly in wing shape, pattern, and color. < ref name=psf > Paul Smart Fres (1977). ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Butterfly World.''
