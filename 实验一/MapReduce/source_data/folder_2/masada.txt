 Masada is an ancient [[fortification]] in the Southern District of [[Israel]]. It is on top of an isolated rock [[plateau]], like a [[mesa]]. The rock is on the east of the [[Judaean Desert]], and overlooks the [[Dead Sea]]. 
 
 [[Herod the Great]] fortified Masada between 37 and 31 [[BC]], and built palaces for himself on the mountain.  
 
 According to [[Josephus]], the [[Sicarii]], a splinter group of the [[Hebrew Zealots]], held out against a [[Roman legion]] here.  This was the [[Siege of Masada]] at the end of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]]. The seige ended in the [[mass suicide]] of 960 people – the rebels and their families. < ref > Stiebel, Guy D. 2007.
