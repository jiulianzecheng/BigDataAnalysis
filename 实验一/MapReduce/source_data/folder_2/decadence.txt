 '''Decadence''' (pronounced: DEK-a-dence) means a state in which people are behaving in a way that is regarded by some people as being [[moral]]ly bad.  The [[adjective]] is 'decadent'.  It has nothing to do with the word [[decade]] (10 years).   
 
 ==Where the word came from== 
 “Decadence” comes from the [[Latin]] words “de” (from) and “cadere” (to fall).  Thus it means ''to fall from a higher state of being''. 
 
 ==Decadence and society== 
 Decadence is usually a state in a [[society]] which used to be good but has become bad. Many people have started to behave in a way that others think is shocking and society does not function as well as it did before.  Of course, not everyone will agree what is “good” or “bad”, but some societies, such as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], are thought to have been decadent. 
 
 ==Decadence and the arts==

 The end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often called the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' (end of century). It is an example of a supposed decadent society in [[literature]] and [[art]].  
 
 In [[France]] there were several writers who were happy to be called “decadent”.  They included [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. In France, the [[symbolist]] artists such as [[Gustave Moreau]] regarded themselves as  " decadent " . In [[England]] decadent artists included the author [[Oscar Wilde]] and visual artists such as [[Aubrey Beardsley]]. The  " decadents "  advocated living a  " decadent lifestyle " , which means a lifestyle based on seeking  the maximum possible amount of [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[pleasure]].  
 
 In the early 1970s, [[glam rock]] musicians such as [[David Bowie]] called themselves  " decadent " . David Bowie's 1973 album ''Diamond Dogs'' is about the theme of decadence.  Glam rock musicians and fans of glam rock music signaled that they were decadent by wearing platform shoes. The popular 1976 film ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' was a humorous depiction of  " decadence " .  
 
 People of the [[goth subculture]], which began in the early 1980s among fans of the band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], generally regard themselves as being  " decadent " .  One way they may symbolize themselves as being decadent is by wearing fishnet stockings.
