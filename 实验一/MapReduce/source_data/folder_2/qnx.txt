'''QNX''' is an Unix-like, [[real-time operating system]] that is [[Embedded system|embedded]] in cars, medical devices, machinery, and other devices. The QNX operating system contains a [[microkernel]] that handles basic core tasks and a group of servers / daemons outside of the kernel that handle most other tasks. This design gives end-users and developers greater control (i.e. freedom) over the operating system. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~voelker/cse221/papers/qnx-paper92.pdf |title=An Architectural Overview of QNX & reg; |author=Dan Hildebrand |date=1992 |work= |publisher=Quantum Software Systems Ltd. |page=10 |accessdate=2013-01-31}} < /ref >  BlackBerry (formerly  < abbr title= " Research In Motion " > RIM < /abbr > ) devices such as the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet and the [[BlackBerry|BlackBerry smartphone]] use modified versions of the QNX operating system.
