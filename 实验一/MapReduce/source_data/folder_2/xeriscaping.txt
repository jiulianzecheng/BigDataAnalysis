 '''Xeriscaping''' is the method of [[Landscape architecture|landscaping]], or [[gardening]], that decreases or eliminates the requirement for [[irrigation]].  
 
 It is encouraged in areas where fresh [[water]] is inaccessible or unreliable. It is gaining favour in other areas as irrigation water becomes scarce. But it is not limited to such places. Xeriscaping could be a good alternative to traditional gardening. 
 
 Water-conserving landscaping, [[drought-tolerant]] landscaping, and smart scaping are names that are used instead in some locations. The choice of plants with natural requirements that are suited to the local climate is stressed, and special attention is paid to reduce water loss due to evaporation and runoff. However, because this method might be climate-dependent, the precise plants employed in xeriscaping differ.
