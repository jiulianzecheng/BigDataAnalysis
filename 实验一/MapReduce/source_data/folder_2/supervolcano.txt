A '''supervolcano''' is a [[volcano]] that can make a [[volcanic eruption]] where the things being thrown out of the volcano have a [[volume]] bigger than {{convert|1000|km3|cumi|abbr=on}}, which is a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] (VEI) of 8. If the [[definition]] is expanded, supervolcanoes also include volcanoes that have volcanic eruptions with a volume bigger than {{convert|100|km3|cumi|abbr=on}}, which is a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 7. This is thousands of times bigger than most volcanic eruptions which happened a long time. < ref > [http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/about/faq/faqsupervolcano.php#supervolcano Questions About Super Volcanoes]. Volcanoes.usgs.gov (2009-05-08). Retrieved on 2011-11-18. < /ref >  Supervolcanoes can occur when [[magma]] in the [[Earth]] rises into the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] from a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], but can not break through the crust. More and more pressure builds up in a large and growing magma pool until the crust can no longer take the [[pressure]].  
 
 Although there are not many [[Quaternary]] supervolcanoes, supervolcanic eruptions usually cover very big areas with [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash]]. They can also cause a long-lasting change to weather (such as causing a [[volcanic winter]] which can trigger a small [[ice age]]), enough to [[Extinction event|possibly make species extinct]].

 == Terminology == 
 
 The term  " supervolcano "  was first used in the [[BBC]] [[popular science]] television program [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|''Horizon'']] in 2000 to mean eruptions of this type. < ref > [http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes.shtml Supervolcanoes]. Bbc.co.uk (2000-02-03). Retrieved on 2011-11-18. < /ref > < ref > [http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Yellowstone/description_yellowstone.html USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory]. Vulcan.wr.usgs.gov.

 [[Volcanologist]]s (who study with volcanoes) and [[geologist]]s do not say  " supervolcanoes "  in their scientific work. This is because the word can mean many different [[geothermal]] conditions.  Since 2003, however, the term has been used by professionals when showing things to the public.  The term ''[[wikt:megacaldera|megacaldera]]'' is sometimes used for [[caldera]]s which are quite similar to supervolcanoes, such as the [[Blake River Megacaldera Complex]] in the [[Abitibi greenstone belt]] of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. 
 
 == Super Eruptions == 
 
 VEI 8 eruptions are considered super-eruptions due to their large scale. The [[Earth|Earth's]] most recent supereruption is the [[Oruanui eruption]], occurring 26,500 years ago.
