 An '''accident''' is when something goes wrong when it is not meant to. Physical accidents are things like [[collision]]s, [[injury|injuries]], and [[Fall (motion)|falling]]. Non-physical accidents are things like telling someone a secret without meaning to, forgetting something important, or deleting an important [[computer]] [[Computer file|file]]. 
 
 [[Car accident|Road accidents]] kill thousands of people each month in the United States, and thousands each week in the world. They injure more thousands each week. The majority involve a [[car]] but there are also many [[bus]], [[truck]] and [[bicycle]] accidents. Aircraft crashes, ship sinkings and other transport accidents also attract much attention.  
 
 Injuries from accidents, however, are more numerous at home than elsewhere. They attract less attention because only a few people are hurt at a time.   
 
 Often, accidents are [[wikt:investigation|investigated]] so that we can learn how to avoid them in the future. Sometimes by studying an accident we can discover new things, for example [[penicillin]]. 
 
 Most of the deaths resulting from injuries are caused by [[fire]] accidents. Thus, accidental fires are one of the leading causes of unintentional deaths.  The main cause of death in fire incidents is burning, but inhalation of smoke and [[toxic]] gas causes death as well. Often the cause of the fire is very simple and unexpected, such as forgetting a candle near something [[flammable]], defect in the hardware, or old electrical wires. So most of the large fires are caused by simple reasons. < ref > {{cite web|website=lawyers and settlements|title=Fire Accidents|url=http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/lawsuit/fire_accident.html#.VQG7IhDF8Yd|accessdate=12 March 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 == Work accidents == 
 Industrial accidents such as [[Mining|mine]] cave-ins and the [[West Gate Bridge]] collapse also kill and maim many workers. The [[Bhopal disaster]] killed thousands, mostly not workers.  
 
 An accident at work is defined as an external, sudden and violent event. Work accidents happen while an someone is working. It may cause the injury or death of the worker or someone else.  For an accident to be a work accident, there must be a direct or indirect relationship of cause and effect between the accident and the work. 
 
 Many [[construction worker]]s are injured.  There are multiple reasons for that, but the main  reason is working on the edge of high buildings without using a safety belt. Thus, you have to follow the safety rules when you are working on these places. < ref > {{cite web|title=construction accident|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Danbury-man-dies-in-Stamford-construction-accident-2236174.php|website=newstimes|date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Chemical]] accidents can happen in a [[laboratory]].  Especially, some [[student]]s make chemical mistakes that injure them seriously. < ref > {{cite web|title=Labs Are Dangerous|url=http://www.realclearscience.com/lists/worst_lab_accidents_in_history/|website=real clear science|accessdate=12 March 2015}} < /ref >
