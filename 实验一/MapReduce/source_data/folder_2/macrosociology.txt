'''Macro-sociology''' is a way of looking at the [[earth|world]] of people in a broad way.   It is   " concerned with human societies " .  Macrosociology is considered one of the main foundations of [[sociology]] (contrast with [[micro-sociology]]). 
 
 In sociology there are different levels of analysis. Macro-sociology is the analysis of either large collectivities (the city, the church) or, more abstractly, of social systems and social structures. (Dictionary of Sociology, 2000) 
 
 With the perspective of macro-sociology, it is possible to better understand societies, [[culture]], [[Group|groups]] and [[Organization|organizations]]. 
 
 Important representatives of macro-sociological theories are: 
 * [[Karl Marx]]; who analyzed society from the perspective of class conflict between workers and owners. 
 * [[Max Weber]]; who viewed society as rapidly modernizing and looked at the effects of this process, such as [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratization]]. 
 * [[Emile Durkheim]]; who viewed individual issues as reflective of greater social patterns, completing the first sociological study which linked [[suicide]] to societal trends.
