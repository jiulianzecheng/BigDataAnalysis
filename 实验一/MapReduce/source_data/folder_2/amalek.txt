 [[Amalek]] was a [[nation]] in the [[Torah]] and [[Old Testament]] whose [[people]] called the Amalekites were [[enemies]] of the [[Israelites]]. 
 
 ==Genesis== 
 
 In the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Chapter]] 36 [[Verse]] 10, [[Esau]] married a [[woman]] [[name]]d Ada and she gave [[birth]] to a [[son]] [[name]]d Eliphaz. Then in Chapter 36 Verse 12, Eliphaz had a [[concubine]] named Timna and she gave [[birth]] to a [[son]] named [[Amalek]]. 
 
 ==Exodus== 
 
 In the [[Book of Exodus]] Chapter 17, Amalek’s [[descendant]]s called the Amalekites attacked  the [[Israelites]] after the Israelites left [[Egypt]].  So [[Moses]] sent [[Joshua]] to [[fight]] the Amalekites. As long as Moses held his [[hand]]s in the [[air]], the Israelites were [[win]]ning but Moses’s hands got tired so he got his [[brother]] [[Aaron]] to hold one up while [[Hur]] held the other up. And Joshua beat the Amalekites.   
 
 Then in the [[Book of Exodus]] [[Chapter]] 17 Verse 14, the Lord told Moses “[[write]] this for a [[memorial]] in the [[book]] and recount it in the [[hear]]ing of [[Joshua]],  that I will utterly blot out the [[name]] of Amalek from under [[heaven]]”. 
 
 ==Numbers== 
 In the [[Book of Numbers]], [[King]] [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] hired [[Balaam]] to [[curse]] the [[Israelite]]s but Balaam ended up [[blessing]] the Israelites instead. And when Balaam had a [[vision]] of the [[future]] of the [[Israelites]] and their [[victory]] over their [[enemies]], he said “ Amalek was the first of the [[nation]]s but his [[end]] shall come to destruction” (Numbers 24:20). 
 
 ==Deuteronomy== 
 In the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], [[Chapter]] 25, the Lord tells the [[Israelite]]s to “remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you were coming out of [[Egypt]]” that the Amalekites attacked the Israelites from behind and [[kill]]ed the tired and weak. And because of it, the Lord tells the [[Israelites]] to “blot out the [[memory|remembrance]] of Amalek from beneath [[heaven]]. You shall not forget.” 
 
 ==First Samuel== 
 In the first [[Book]] of [[Samuel]], [[Chapter]] 15,  the Lord told [[Samuel]] to tell [[Saul]] to [[kill]] all Amalekites and destroy all of their [[property]] and [[kill]] all their [[animal]]s because it was something that the Lord told the [[Israelites]] to do back in the time of [[Moses]]. But when Saul attacked Amalek, he captured [[King]] [[Agag]] instead of [[kill]]ing him and Saul and his [[warrior]]s kept the best [[animal]]s for themselves but “everything despised and worthless that they utterly destroyed” (1 Samuel 15:9).  So the Lord sent [[Samuel]] to [[King]] Saul to tell him “now the Lord sent you on a [[mission]] and said “go and utterly destroy the [[sin]]ners, the Amalekites, and [[fight]] against them until they are [[exterminate]]d. Why then did you not obey the [[voice]] of the Lord?”. (1 Samuel 15:18-19). When Saul said that he [[kill]]ed the Amalekites except for their [[king]] and was actually going to [[sacrifice]] their [[animal]]s to the Lord, Samuel told him 
 
   
 “Has the Lord as great [[joy|delight]] in burnt offerings and [[sacrifice]]s as in obeying the [[voice]] of the Lord. Behold to [[obey]] is better than [[sacrifice]] and to heed than the [[fat]] of [[ram]]s. For [[rebellion]] is as the [[sin]] of [[witchcraft]] and [[stubbornness]] is as iniquity and [[idolatry]]. Because you have rejected the [[word]] of the Lord, He has also rejected you from being [[king]].”  
 
 Then Samuel told Saul to bring the Amalekite King Agag to him and Saul did. And Saul told Agag “As your [[sword]] has made [[women]] childless so shall your [[mother]] be childless among [[women]]” and cut Agag to pieces. (1 Samuel 15:33) 
 
 Later on in the first of the [[Books of Samuel]], [[David]] [[fight]]s the Amalekites. 
 
 ==Second Samuel== 
 In the second [[book]] of [[Samuel]], a [[man]] told [[David]] that he is the [[son]] of an Amalekite and that he happened to be on [[Mount Gilboa]] after the [[battle]]. The man said that Saul asked him who he was and he told him “an Amalekite”. The Amalekite said that Saul asked him to [[kill]] him so that the [[Philistines]] couldn’t [[torture]] him and he [[kill]]ed Saul. David said the man was a [[murderer]] because he [[kill]]ed the [[King]] of [[Israel]] so David cut his [[head]] off.  
 
 ==Chronicles== 
 In the [[Books of Chronicles]], there is a [[family tree]] which says that [[Esau]] became the [[father]] of Eliphaz and Eliphaz became the father of Amalek.
