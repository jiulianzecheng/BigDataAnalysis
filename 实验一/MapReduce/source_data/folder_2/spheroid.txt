 A '''spheroid''' is a kind of [[ellipsoid]]. < ref > In mathematics, ellipsoids are quadrics or quadric surfaces. < /ref >  It is got by rotating an [[ellipse]] about one of its principal axes. This means it is an [[ellipsoid]] with two equal semi-[[diameter]]s. 
 
 [[Sphere]] < nowiki/ > s are spheroids. Spheroids that are not spheres are either oblate or prolate. 
 
 Most [[celestial object]]s are [[oblate spheroid]]s. They usually spin, and as they spin, [[centrifugal force]] pulls them into that shape. Few natural objects are prolate spheroids.
