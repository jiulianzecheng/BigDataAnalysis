 A '''destroyer''' is a fast, small, and maneuverable [[warship]]. Destroyers escort larger warships. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/destroyers/destroyers.asp|title=The US Navy Destroyers|access-date=2017-03-15|archive-date=2017-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506111917/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/destroyers/destroyers.asp|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Destroyers were first used in the late 1800s to defend against [[torpedo boat]]s. Destroyers were used extensively during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Today, most naval warships are destroyers. Only three nations use [[cruiser]]s. Modern destroyers use [[cruise missile]]s, automated turrets, and [[torpedo]]s. Some can launch [[nuclear missile]]s. Modern destroyers usually support [[carrier groups]] and amphibious landings. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/destroyers.asp|title=Destroyers|access-date=2017-03-15}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.navysite.de/destroyers.htm|title=US NAVY - DESTROYERS|access-date=2017-03-15}} < /ref >
