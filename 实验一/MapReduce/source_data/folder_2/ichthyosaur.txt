 The earliest fossils are from the early [[Triassic]] of 250 million years ago. This is just after the [[Permian]] mass extinction. < ref > Kear B.P; Engelschiøn V.S; Hammer Ø; Roberts A.  &  Hurum J.H. 2023.

 By the [[Upper Triassic]] they were similar in shape to [[dolphin]]s and to fast [[predator]]y [[fish]] like [[tuna]] ([[convergent evolution]]). They are found in marine [[strata]] from the earliest [[Triassic]] to the [[Cretaceous]]. After transitional Triassic types like ''[[Mixosaurus]]'' and ''[[Cymbospondylus]]'', they have essentially the same body shape. < ref name= " Benton " > Benton M.J. 2004. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. 3rd ed, Blackwell, Oxford. < /ref >  ''[[Californosaurus]]'' was one of the first to have the typical dolphin-like body shape. 
 
 Although isolated ichthyosaur vertebrae are quite common, the first fossil which showed the ichthyosaur form was found by [[Mary Anning]] (1799–1847) and her brother Joseph. Mary Anning was an early [[British]] [[fossil]] collector, dealer and [[paleontologist]]. Many of her finds may be seen today at the [[Natural History Museum]], London. 
 
 == Early discoveries == 
 The genus ''Ichthyosaurus'' was first described in 1699 from fossil fragments discovered in [[Wales]]. The first [[fossil]] [[vertebra]]e were published twice in 1708. The first complete ichthyosaur fossil was found in 1811 by [[Mary Anning]] in [[Lyme Regis]], along the [[Jurassic Coast]]. She later discovered three separate species. < ref > McGowan, Christopher  &  Motani, Ryosuke 2003. Ichthyopterygia in ''Handbook of Paleoherpetology'', Part 8, Verlag Dr. Friedrich Pfeil. < /ref > 
 
 === The first major find === 
 Mary Anning's first great discovery was made shortly after her father's death when she was just twelve. In 1810 her bother Joseph found what he thought was a [[crocodile]] skull, but the rest of the animal was not in evidence. < ref name= " Torrens1995 " > Torrens, Hugh. 1995. Mary Anning (1799-1847) of Lyme: 'the greatest fossilist the world ever knew', ''British Journal for the History of Science'', '''25''':257-284. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4027645 JSTOR] 
 < /ref >  Mary kept searching and a year later a storm weathered away part of the cliff and exposed part of the rest of the skeleton of the 17 & nbsp;ft (5.2m) long creature, which she was able to dig out of the cliff and collect with help from local [[quarry]]men. < ref name= " Emling " > Emling, Shelley 2009. ''The fossil hunter''. < /ref > < sup > p33–41 < /sup >  Anning later discovered three more [[species]]. 
 
 === Interpretation === 
 In 1821 [[William Conybeare]] and Mary’s old friend [[Henry De la Beche]], published a paper which analyzed the specimens found by Mary and others. They concluded that ichthyosaurs were a previously unknown kind of marine reptile, and they decided there had been at least three species. < ref name= " Conybeare1821 " > {{cite web|author=De la Beche, Henry|last2=Conybeare, William|date=1821|title=Notice of the discovery of a new fossil animal, forming a link between the Ichthyosaurus and Crocodile, together – with general remarks on the osteology of the Ichthyosaurus|url=http://www.plesiosaur.com/database/references/delabeche_conybeare_1821/page559.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204115349/http://plesiosaur.com/database/references/delabeche_conybeare_1821/page559.htm|archive-date=2010-12-04|publisher=Geological Society of London|accessdate=2010-01-10}} < /ref > < ref > Rudwick, Martin 2008.

 == Anatomy == 
 Ichthyosaurs were reptiles that evolved fish-shaped body outlines. Some of their characteristics were unique: they had enormous eyeballs, sometimes more than 25 & nbsp;cm in [[diameter]]. They had large hands (''manus'') with up to 20 bones in a single digit, and up to 10 digits per manus. < ref > Motani R. 2005. Evolution of fish-shaped reptiles (Reptiles: Ichthyopterygia) in their physical environments and constraints. ''Annual Revew of Earth and Planetary Science''. '''33''', 395{{ndash}}420. [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.33.092203.122707] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322185740/https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.33.092203.122707|date=2019-03-22}} < /ref > 
 
 They had streamlined form, paddles, fish-like tail, and no neck. Ichthyosaurs averaged about 2–4m (6–13 & nbsp;ft) in length; a few were smaller, and some species grew much larger. They had a [[porpoise]]-like head and a long, toothed snout. Built for speed, like modern [[tuna]], some ichthyosaurs appear also to have been deep divers, like some modern whales. < ref > Motani R. 2000. Rulers of the Jurassic seas. ''Scientific American'' '''283''', #6. < /ref >  It has been estimated that ichthyosaurs could swim at speeds up to {{convert|40|km/h|mph}}. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/42/beeldende-kunst/ | title=Genetologic Research » Blog Archive » Ichthyosaurus }} < /ref >  Like modern [[cetacea]]ns such as whales and dolphins, they were air-breathing. 
 
 === Weight === 
 According to weight estimates by Ryosuke Motani, a {{convert|2.4|m|ft}} ''[[Stenopterygius]]'' weighed around {{convert|163|-|168|kg|lb}} whilst a {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} ''[[Ophthalmosaurus|Ophthalmosaurus icenicus]]'' weighed 930–950 & nbsp;kg (1.03–1.04 [[short ton]]s). < ref name=UCMP/ > 
 
 === Body size and metabolism === 
 Scientists have wondered whether ancient reptiles like ichthyosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded.  Experts from the University of Plymouth studied many animals that dive and hold their breath, from insects to whales. They found that larger animals can hold their breath longer than smaller animals because they can store more oxygen for their size, and they found this difference was much bigger for warm-blooded animals than for cold-blooded animals.  They said this could be why modern whales became so large.  They concluded that the large size of ichthyosaurs, like whales, meant they were more likely to be warm-blooded than cold-blooded. < ref name= " Plymouth " > {{cite press release|author=University of Plymouth|publisher=Eurekalert.org|title=Scientists reveal new fundamental principles governing diving in animals |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-05/uop-srn052620.php|date=May 26, 2020|accessdate=June 1, 2020}} < /ref > < ref name= " Diving " > {{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspb.2020.0488 |publisher=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|title=Universal metabolic constraints shape the evolutionary ecology of diving in animals|date=May 27, 2020|author1=Wilco C.E.P.

 === Convergent evolution === 
 [[File:Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur.jpg|thumb]] 
 Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said the ichthyosaur was his favourite example of [[convergent evolution]]. Its similarities to fish are not ''[[homology (biology)|homologous]]'', caused by common descent, but ''analogous'', caused by selection in the same environment: 
 
 : " This sea-going reptile with terrestrial ancestors converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a [[dorsal fin]] and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design. These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing – the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor " . < ref > Gould, Stephen Jay 1993. Bent out of shape. Essay 5 in ''Eight little piggies''. New York: Norton, 479 < /ref > 
 
 === Eyes === 
 [[File:Ophthalmosaurus BW.jpg|thumb]] 
 The eyes of ichthyosaurs are large in comparison to the size of the body, suggesting they hunted by sight even in dimly-lit waters or at night. In fact, ichthyosaurs hold the record for eye size: the largest was 264mm in diameter (~10.4 & nbsp;inches), from the species ''[[Temnodontosaurus platyodon]]''. This is the largest eye ever recorded for any [[vertebrate]], though the [[colossal squid]] eye is larger still. < ref name= " UCMP " > University of California Museum of Paleontology: Motani's Ichthyosaur page [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/motani/ichthyo/eyes.html] < /ref > < ref name= " Motani " > {{cite journal|last=Motani Ryosuke 2009.|title=The evolution of marine reptiles|journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |year=2009|volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=224–235|issn=1936-6426|doi=10.1007/s12052-009-0139-y|s2cid=44043921}} < /ref > < ref > [http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ipR6P2N6xG6MDAYbpLi1FJ7aOVKA World's biggest squid reveals 'beach ball' eyes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208043838/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ipR6P2N6xG6MDAYbpLi1FJ7aOVKA |date=2009-12-08 }} ''AFP'', via Google. < /ref >  The eyes of ichthyosaurs are protected by [[sclerotic ring]]s. These are circlar bony plates inside the outer edges of the [[cornea]] of the eye. Their function is mechanical support of the eye. They are well preserved in fossil ichthyosaur skulls. 
 
 === Fins === 
 [[File:Dinosaurs at CMNH 11.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Unidentified ichthyosaur: body outlined (in paint) shows the tail and dorsal fins]] 
 At first, the downward-pointing [[tail]] [[bone]]s were hard to interpret. Then, later in the 19th century, a remarkable find was made. Some specimens of ''Mixosaurus'' and ''Stenopterygius'' were well preserved in the black mudstones of [[Germany]]. These fossils were preserved in such fine sediment that the fossils were almost perfect, with only a few [[bone]]s disturbed or missing. The outline of the body shape could be seen as a thin carbon film. < ref name= " Reign " > An excellent photographic illustration is given in Benton M.J. 1990. ''The reign of the reptiles''. Quarto, N.Y. < /ref > < sup > p10 < /sup >  Even though the soft parts had [[wikt:rot|rotted away]] long ago, they left their imprint behind. For the first time, scientists could see clearly that the tail of ichthyosaurus was shaped like the tail of a fish. And on its back, like a shark, there was a dorsal fin. 
 
 === Live birth === 
 [[File:Maternal Chaohusaurus.png|thumb|right|300px|Diagram from the PLoS paper: key features of the fossil ''Chaohusaurus'' < br/ > The maternal ''Chaohusaurus'' specimen with three embryos. Color coding shows: black, maternal [[vertebral column]], including neural and haemal spines; blue, maternal [[pelvis]] and hind flipper; green, maternal [[ribs]] and [[gastralia]]. Embryos 1 and 2 are in orange and yellow, and neonate 1 is in red. [[Scale (ratio)|Scale bar]] = 1 cm]] 
 
 Live birth was always assumed for ichthyosaurs, because with their paddles they could never have manoeuvred on land to lay eggs as [[turtle]]s do. As reptiles, they produced [[cleidoic egg]]s, but they were entirely aquatic and their eggs developed inside the mother. Once more, evidence came from the early [[Jurassic]] of Germany, where several fine examples clearly show embryos inside the rib cage of the adult. Other examples exist of the young actually being born. < ref name= " Reign " / > < sup > p125 < /sup > < ref > Between 1900 and 1930, the Natural History Museum, London, purchased at least three important specimens of ''Stenopterygius'' from German collectors. These specimens, now on display, show the embryos and juvenile forms associated with adults (information from display captions). < /ref >  They came out tail first. No doubt, some complication of birth had killed both mother and offspring together. 
 
 A recent study of the earliest ichthosaur, ''[[Chaohusaurus]]'', from the [[Lower Triassic]] shows an early example of live birth. < ref name= " Mot " > Motani, Ryosuke ''et al'' 2014 Terrestrial origin of viviparity in Mesozoic marine reptiles indicated by early Triassic embryonic fossils. ''PLoS One'' [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0088640#pone-0088640-g002] < /ref >  A remarkable feature was a baby close to emerging ''head-first''. The authors comment: 
 : " Its headfirst birth posture... strongly indicates a terrestrial origin of [[viviparity]], in contrast to the traditional view. The tail-first birth posture in [[derived]] ichthyopterygians, [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with the conditions in [[whales]] and sea cows, therefore is a secondary feature " . They comment  " obligate marine [[amniotes]] appear to have evolved almost exclusively from viviparous land ancestors " . < ref name=Motani/ > 
 
 In other words, ichthyosaurs gave live birth when they were still land dwellers. Then, later, they adapted to an aquatic life. 
 
 == Extinction == 
 [[File:Ichthyosauria phylogeny.jpg|thumb|center|500px|The fate of the ichthyosaurs. The diagram should start earlier, at the beginning of the Triassic period.]] 
 
 Ichthyosaurs became [[extinct]] during the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 30 million years before the [[K/T extinction event]]. There was an [[ocean anoxic event]] at the Cenomanian–Turonian stage boundary. The deeper layers of the seas became [[anoxic]] and poisoned by [[hydrogen sulphide]] (H < sub > 2 < /sub > S). As life died off in the lower ([[benthos]]) levels of the sea, so did the [[predator]]s at the top of the food chain. The last [[pliosaur]]s and ichthyosaurs became extinct. < ref name= " Benton " / > < sup > p251 < /sup > 
 
 Ichthyosaurs had been dwindling in numbers for some time: they were no longer the force they once were in the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic. By the middle Jurassic, it was thought thought they all belonged to the single [[clade]], the [[Ophthalmosauridae]]. < ref name=McGowan/ >  By the Cretaceous it was thought that only three [[genera]] survived. For the last 50+ years it has been thought that only one genus, ''[[Platypterygius]]'', was known at the time of the [[anoxic event]] in the Upper Cretaceous. < ref name=McGowan > McGowan C 1972. The systematics of Cretaceous ichthyosaurs with particuliar reference to the material from North America. ''Contributions to Geology'' '''11''': 9–29. < /ref > 
 
 However, a recent review looked at the main collections in western European museums. This review found evidence for four genera of ichthyosaur only a few million years before the extinction event. < ref > Fischer, Valentin ''et al'' 2014. ''High diversity in Cretaceous Ichthyosaurs from Europe prior to their extinction''. PLoS ONE DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084709. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0084709#pone.0084709-McGowan1] < /ref > 
 
 These genera occupied various  " feeding guilds " . They were: 
 *''[[Platypterygius]]'': a top predator 
 *''[[Sisteronia]]'': a  " pierce-oriented "  feeder on soft and small prey 
 *''[[Cetarthrosaurus]]'', a generalist 
 * an undertermined [[Ophthalmosauridae|Ophthalmosaur]]: a generalist feeder 
 
 This means that there was still diversity in ichthyosaurs a few million years before the extinction event. They may have survived right up to the extinction event. 
 
 It is true, though, that the ichthyosaurs had declined from their peak. By the [[Cretaceous]] they certainly had more competitors than in the [[Triassic]], and more [[wikt:escape|elusive]] [[prey]]. The [[adaptive radiation]] of [[teleost]] fish meant their new [[prey]] were fast swimming and highly [[wikt:evade|evasive]]. The teleosts also included fast-swimming [[predator]]y fish, which must have been competitors. From what we know now, the ocean anoxic event must have ended the last ichthyosaurs. 
 
 The ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs were replaced in the [[Ocean|marine]] [[ecology]] by the giant [[mosasaur]]s. The mosasaurs were probably [[ambush]] hunters, whose sit-and-wait strategy apparently proved most successful. < ref > Lingham-Soliar T. 1999.
