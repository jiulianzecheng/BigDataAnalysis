 '''Sorrel''' (''Rumex acetosa''), also called '''common sorrel''' or '''garden sorrel''', is a [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[Herbaceous plant|herb]] that is cultivated as a garden [[herb]] or [[leaf vegetable]] (pot herb). Sorrel is also known by the names '''spinach dock''' and '''narrow-leaved dock'''. 
 
 ==Growth== 
 Sorrel is a slender [[plant]]. It is about 60 & nbsp;[[centimetre]]s (cm) high, and it has [[roots]] that go far into the ground. Sorrel also has juicy stems and [[:en:oblong|oblong]] [[leaf|leaves]] that can be eaten. 
 
 ==Characteristics== 
 It has [[:en:whorl|whorl]]ed spikes of reddish-green [[flower]]s, which bloom in summer, becoming purplish. The [[stamen]]s and [[pistil]]s are on different plants ([[dioecious]]); the ripe [[seed]]s are brown and shining. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves may be [[pur√©e]]d in [[soup]]s and [[sauce]]s or added to [[salad]]s and [[sorrel soup|shav]]; they have a flavour that is similar to [[kiwifruit]] or sour [[garden strawberry|wild strawberries]]. The plant's sharp taste is due to [[oxalic acid]], which is a [[poison]]. In small quantities sorrel is harmless; in large quantities it can be fatal. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.womens-health-club.com/herbs/sorrel.htm|title=Sorrel-Uses And Side Effects|website=www.womens-health-club.com}} < /ref >
