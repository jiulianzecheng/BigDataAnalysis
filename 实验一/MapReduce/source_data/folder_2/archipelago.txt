 An '''archipelago''' ({{PronEng|ɑrkəˈpɛləgoʊ}}) is a chain or group of [[island]]s. The word ''archipelago'' means  " chief [[sea]] " , from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''arkhon'' (''arkhi''-) ( " leader " ) and ''pelagos'' ( " sea " ). 
 
 Archipelagos are usually found in the open [[sea]]; less commonly, a big [[landmass]] may neighbor them, an example being [[Scotland]] which has more than 700 islands surrounding the mainland. Many archipelagos are [[volcano|volcanic]], forming along [[mid-ocean ridge]]s or [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. Others are island arcs neighboring an [[oceanic trench]]. Many other processes create archipelagos, including [[erosion]], [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]], and [[Orogeny|land elevation]]. 
 
 The four biggest [[countries]] that are mainly archipelagos are [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Indonesia]] (the world's biggest country that is an archipelago, according to the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]). < ref > {{Cite web |title=World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html |access-date=2008-05-29 |archive-date=2016-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527061311/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The biggest archipelago in the world by size is in Northern [[Canada]], the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], which is in the [[Arctic Ocean]].
