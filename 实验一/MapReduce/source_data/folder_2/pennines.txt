 The '''Pennines''' are a [[mountain range]] in [[England]]. Often said to be the  " [[backbone]] of England " , they form an unbroken range stretching from the [[Peak District]] in the [[Midlands]], through the [[Yorkshire Dales]], parts of [[Greater Manchester]], the [[West Pennine Moors]] of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cumbria|Cumbrian]] Fells to the [[Cheviot Hills]] on the [[Scotland|Scottish]] border. Their total length is about {{convert|250|mi|km|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. 
 ==Etymology== 
 The name ''Pennines'' is believed to come from the [[Celtic language|Celtic]] ''pennioroches'', meaning  " hill " , although the earliest written reference to the name dates only from the [[18th century]].  
 
 ==Altitude and size== 
 The mountains are not very tall and are often called hills. The highest is [[Cross Fell]] in eastern Cumbria, at {{convert|893|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Other main mountain peaks include [[Mickle Fell]] {{convert|788|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, [[Whernside]] {{convert|736|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, [[Ingleborough]] {{convert|723|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, [[Pen-y-ghent]] {{convert|693|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, and [[Kinder Scout]] {{convert|636|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. 
 
 The landscape of the Pennines are mostly upland areas of high [[moorland]].  
 The Pennines make up the main [[water divide|watershed]] in northern England, dividing the eastern and western parts of the country. The rivers [[River Eden, Cumbria|Eden]], [[River Ribble|Ribble]], and [[River Mersey|Mersey]] flow west towards the [[Irish Sea]]. On the other side of the watershed, the rivers [[River Tyne, England|Tyne]], [[River Tees|Tees]], [[River Swale|Swale]], [[River Calder|Calder]], [[River Aire|Aire]], [[River Don, England|Don]], and [[River Trent|Trent]] flow east to the [[North Sea]].
