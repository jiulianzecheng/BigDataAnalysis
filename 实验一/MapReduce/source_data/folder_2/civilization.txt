 '''Civilization''' (or civilisation) comes from the [[Latin]] word ''civis'' meaning someone who lives in a city. The Romans usually wanted conquered people to live in towns. When people are civilized, they have learned from the wisdom, skill, and [[knowledge]] gained over [[centuries]] of human progress. The opposite of civilization is sometimes said to be [[entropy]], [[Barbarian|barbarity]], rudeness, or animal-like behavior.  
 
 A civilization is generally an advanced stage of [[organisation|organization]]. That means it has [[laws]], [[culture]], and a regular way of getting food and protecting the people. Most civilizations have [[agriculture]] and a system of [[government]] like [[monarch]]s or [[election]]s. They speak a common language and usually have a [[religion]] of some kind. They teach their young the knowledge they need. All civilizations since the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] have had some kind of [[writing]]. This is because writing lets people store and build up [[knowledge]]. Civilizations also have large cities, large and unique [[architecture]], and complex labor divisions.  < ref > {{Cite web|title=Key Components of Civilization {{!}} National Geographic Society|url=https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/key-components-civilization|access-date=2022-07-29|website=education.nationalgeographic.org}} < /ref > < ref > Adams, Robert McCormick (1966).

 == Examples == 
 Past societies that would be called more primitive compared to today, are still often referred to as civilizations for their time. The [[Roman Empire]] is an example of a past large civilization. It was governed by [[Rome]]. This [[empire]] once stretched from the [[Scotland|Scottish]] borders to [[North Africa]] and the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. Their language was [[Latin language|Latin]].   
 
 Latin remained the preferred way of communication among educated people, long after their civilization had vanished. Some scientists, scholars, and others in [[Western civilization]] still use Latin in the course of everyday work, even though the Western Roman civilization fell apart more than 1,500 years ago. The [[Roman]] civilization lasted almost 1000 years. 
 
 Other examples of civilizations are the [[Inca Empire|Incas]] and [[Aztecs]]. They had large territories with complex cities and social structures. The empires were made of [[City-state|city-states]]. They had advanced [[Farming|agriculture]] that could feed many people. They also had complex [[architecture]].  
 
 One way a civilization ends is to become part of another civilization. For example, Ancient Egypt was conquered by foreigners who changed the country. It became part  of Persian, Greek, Roman, and Islamic civilization. Another way is to go back to an earlier, simpler way of life. For example, Roman civilization collapsed in the Dark Ages. When people became more civilized again, it was the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] civilization. < ref > Hagger, Nicholas. The Rise and Fall of Civilizations. United Kingdom: O Books, 2008. < /ref >
