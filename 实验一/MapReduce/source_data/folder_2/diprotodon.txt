 '''''Diprotodon''''' was the largest [[marsupial]] that ever lived, or at any rate, the heaviest. Its family, the Diprotodontidae, existed from at least 1.6 million years ago until extinction some 40,000 years ago. < ref name =  " New Ages " > {{Cite journal| last =  Roberts R.G.

Its forebears lived in the  late [[Oligocene]] to early [[Miocene]] roughly 23 million years ago. 
 
 ''Diprotodon'' looked like a [[Rhinoceros|rhino]] without a horn. Its feet turned inwards like a [[wombat]]’s, giving it a [[pigeon]]-toed appearance. It had strong claws on the front feet, so it may have been able to dig up roots to eat. Footprints of its hairy feet have been found, so we know it had fur like a horse rather than being bald like a rhino. ''Diprotodon'' is found in sites all over [[Australia]], but not in [[Tasmania]].  
 
 Female skeletons have been found with babies where the mother's pouch would have been. < ref name=BBC-diprotodon > {{cite web|title=Science  &  Nature: Animals: Diprotodon|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/3040.shtml|work=Official website|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)]]|accessdate=24 February 2011|date=July 2008}} < /ref >  The largest specimens were [[hippopotamus]]-sized: about {{convert|3|m|ft}} from nose to tail, standing {{convert|2|m|ft}} tall at the shoulder and weighing about {{convert|2790|kg|lb}}. < ref name=smh > [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1016_031017_giantmarsupial.html Ice age marsupial topped three tons, scientists say].

 The animal was semi-aquatic with a life-style rather like a [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]. Its extinction may have been caused by the extreme drought conditions, as well as pressure from the first Aboriginal Australians.
