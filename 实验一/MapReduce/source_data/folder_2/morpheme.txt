A '''morpheme''' is the smallest [[Linguistics|linguistic]] part of a [[word]] that can have a meaning. In other words, it is the smallest meaningful part of a word. Examples of morphemes would be the parts  " un- " ,  " break " , and  " -able "  in the word  " unbreakable " . 
 
 There are 5 types of morpheme: 
 # ''Free morpheme'': a morpheme which can be joined with other morphemes (such as un'''break'''able) or on its own (such as '''break''') 
 # ''Bound morpheme'': a morpheme which can only be used when joined to other morphemes (such as '''un'''breakable) 
 # ''Derivational morpheme'': a morpheme which can be derived (added) to another morpheme to create a new word (such as adding '''-ness''' to ''happy'' to form the new word ''happiness'') 
 # ''Inflectional morpheme'': a morpheme which can change a word's tense, number, etc. (such as adding '''-s''' to ''dog'' to form the plural ''dogs'') 
 # ''Allomorphs'': different types of the same morpheme (for example, the morpheme ''ed'' can have the sound 'id' in the word ''hunt'''ed''''', the sound 't' in the word ''fish'''ed''''' or the sound 'd' in the word ''buzz'''ed''''')
