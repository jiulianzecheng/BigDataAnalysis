 The '''stern''' is the rear part of a [[ship]] or [[boat]].  
 
 The stern area has always been the place near the steering apparatus ([[rudder]],  [[tiller]], [[Steering wheel (ship)|ship's wheel]], etc.), and by extension became the domain of the ship's [[captain]] and other officers. In particular, the stern was the location of the officers' quarters, and during the [[age of sail]] became the most luxurious part of the ship, with rows of windows, [[balcony|galleries]], [[walkway]]s, and fine decorations. That meant that this part was rather vulnerable, and the goal of much maneuvering in battle was to achieve the [[Raking fire|stern rake]], in which a ship would pour its entire [[broadside]] into the stern. 
 
 Other features of the stern included [[lantern]]s and the [[ensign]].
