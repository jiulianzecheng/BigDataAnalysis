'''Perjury''' is the word used for a person that tells a [[lie]] while they are under [[oath]] (in a [[courtroom]]). Committing perjury is against the law, and can be punished with a [[jail]] or [[prison]] sentence. 
 
 Perjury is a serious crime because it might be used to take away the power of a court, which can lead to punishment for the wrong person. In the United States, perjury is a federal offense, and it can be punished by five years in prison. However, in California, a person who commits perjury can get the death penalty if the perjury led to a wrongful execution. 
 
 The rules of perjury also apply when a person says or does something ''under penalty of perjury'', even if he or she never swore an oath. One example is the United States' [[income tax]] return, where people have to sign as true and correct under penalty of perjury. A person can be punished by three years in prison if he or she lies on the tax return. 
 
 A statement that involves ''interpretation'' are not perjury because people can judge incorrectly without knowing it. Perjury only happens if a person wanted to do it and then actually did.
