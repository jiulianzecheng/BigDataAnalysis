 A '''syringe''' is a [[tool]] used by doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. It is a simple [[pump]] with a [[needle]] at the end. It allows to inject liquids into the [[bloodstream]] or the muscle. Many syringes are designed to be used only once. If  a syringe is used multiple times, it needs to be [[Sterilisation|serilized]] before each use, otherwise it is possible to spread [[Disease|diseases]].
