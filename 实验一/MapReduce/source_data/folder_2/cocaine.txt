'''Cocaine''' (also '''cocain''') is a strong [[stimulant|stimulant drug]] that is made from [[Coca|coca leaves]] that is in most countries [[was made illegal in 2017]]. Cocaine is usually a white powder. Because it is a [[stimulant]], cocaine gives people energy. It also makes people feel very happy when it is taken. When used this way, cocaine is very [[addiction|addictive]]. However, cocaine can also be used as a local [[anesthetic]] if it is applied topically (onto the skin or [[gums]]). < ref > ''Macmillan Dictionary for Students'' Macmillan, Pan Ltd. (1981), page 192.

 == Origin and effects == 
 === Where cocaine comes from === 
 [[File:Colcoca02.jpg|thumb|Leaves of the Coca plant]] 
 The [[Inca]] of [[Peru]] were consumers.  < ref > P F Brain, G A Coward [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2485453/ A review of the history, actions, and legitimate uses of cocaine] J Subst Abuse. 1989;1(4):431-51. < /ref >  Cocaine is taken from the leaves of the [[coca]] plant of [[South America]].  < ref > Michaela Patafio reviewed by Arefa Cassoobhoy, MD, MPH [https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/cocaine-use-and-its-effects Cocaine use and its effects] WebMD < /ref >  Coca plants are mostly grown in [[South America]], in countries like [[Brazil]] or [[Argentina]]. When [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistador|conquistadors]] (explorers) discovered coca plants, they sent them back to [[Europe]]. People started using cocaine as a medicine, as well as in drinks and food. This was because they did not know how damaging and addictive the drug could be when used. 
 
 In America, cocaine was used during [[surgery]], or to treat [[Toothache|toothaches]]. It was also put into drinks. When [[Coca-Cola]] was first made in 1885, it got the first part of its name from the  " handful of coca leaves "  added to the drink for energy. (The [[caffeine]] in the drink came from the kola nut, so the name  " Coca-Cola "  was chosen.) Cocaine was taken out of Coca-Cola completely by the 1920s because of pressure from groups in the [[United States]]. 
 
 === Effects of cocaine === 
 When cocaine is applied topically (onto the skin or gums), it causes [[numbness]]. 
 
 When cocaine is chewed or eaten, [[Inhalation|inhaled]] into the nose ( " snorted " ), or [[Injection|injected]] into the [[vein]]s, it causes people to feel [[Euphoria|euphoric]] (very happy), alert, very confident, and full of energy.  This feeling is called being  " high. "   Some people who take cocaine also have unpleasant feelings.  They may feel worried, [[Anxiety|anxious]], or even [[paranoia|paranoid]].  They may also have physical [[symptoms]], like shaking, a high [[heart rate]], and high body [[temperature]]. 
 
 Cocaine cannot be smoked in its normal form. It must [[Chemical reaction|react with another chemical]] to form [[Crack (drug)|crack cocaine]], which can be smoked. This is because burning normal cocaine destroys it, so the user does not get the effect they want.

 In most countries, it is illegal to make, sell, or use cocaine (unless it is being used for approved medical reasons). 
 
 As an [[Illegal drugs|illegal drug]], cocaine can be used in its powder form, or it can be made into [[crack cocaine]]. Usually, crack is made by adding [[baking soda]] and water to cocaine and then heating the mixture. Crack is usually less expensive than the normal form of cocaine. Crack is usually smoked. It gives users a high that is very strong, but does not last as long as the high from regular cocaine. Both forms of cocaine are addictive, although crack cocaine is thought to be more addictive as it is usually smoked. 
 
 == Dangers of using cocaine == 
 If people use cocaine, they may take too much and get sick or even die. This is called an  " [[overdose]] " . When people take cocaine, they get [[Intoxication|intoxicated]] as well. When a person is intoxicated, they may do dangerous things, such as having unsafe [[sex]] with a person they do not know, or getting into a violent fight with a person. 
 
 If a person uses cocaine for a long time, they can start to get strange feelings, like there are bugs crawling under their skin, or they can get [[paranoia]] (a feeling that there are people that want to hurt them). 
 
 Cocaine is a very addictive drug. It can lead to psychological and/or physical [[Drug addiction|dependence]]. When a person is addicted to a drug, they might do bad or criminal acts in order to get money for more drugs, such as [[crime]]s (for example [[theft]], [[robbery]], [[fraud]], or [[prostitution]]).  If the person tries to stop using cocaine, they will go through [[cocaine withdrawal]]. 
 
 Another danger from using cocaine is the risk of [[infection]] when using unsafe ways of taking cocaine (like using dirty needles when [[Injection|injecting]] cocaine). A person can get [[Infectious disease|infectious diseases]] like [[HIV]] or [[Hepatitis C]] when they use cocaine in these ways. 
 
 == Cocaine as a legal medicine == 
 Cocaine is also occasionally used as a legal [[Medication|medicine]] in [[Australia]] and some parts of [[Europe]], if a person has a [[prescription]] from a [[Medical doctor|doctor]]. Doctors sometimes prescribe cocaine for people who want to lose weight, because cocaine decreases the [[appetite]].  
 
 [[Dentistry|Dentists]] in countries like Australia sometimes use forms of cocaine in dental operations, as an [[anaesthetic]]. Doctors, [[surgeons]], and dentists use anaesthetics when they are doing operations, so that the patient will not feel pain. Dentists put the cocaine on the patient's mouth so that the patient will not feel pain in their mouth during the operation. Cocaine is also used as an ADHD medication in various countries around the world legally. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Oswaks|first=Molly|date=2011-12-14|title=My Struggle With ADD: Using Cocaine to Fight the Symptoms|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/my-struggle-with-add-using-cocaine-to-fight-the-symptoms/248685/|access-date=2023-11-07|website=The Atlantic|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-05-27|title=Cocaine and ADHD: Everything you should know|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cocaine-and-adhd|access-date=2023-11-07|website=www.medicalnewstoday.com|language=en}} < /ref >
