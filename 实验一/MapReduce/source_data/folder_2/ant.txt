 Ants live in [[Colony (biology)|groups]] that can be big or small. Some kinds of ants live in small groups and [[Predation|eat other animals]]. Some ants work together in very big groups. These groups can have millions of ants in them that travel outside every day in a big area. Ants are small, but they are very strong.

 == Colonies == 
 The groups that ants live in are called colonies. A colony has a [[female]] ant called a [[queen]] which lays [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. Those eggs will grow into more ants. Big colonies of ants have different kinds of ants that grow from the eggs. These are called different castes of ants. Some are ''workers'' which do jobs like carrying and digging, and ''soldiers'' which fight other animals. Worker and soldier ants are females. Another type of ant are ''drones'' which are male ants. < ref > {{cite book|title=Caste and ecology in the social insects|last1=Oster|first1=George F.|last2=Wilson|first2=Edward O.|journal=Monographs in Population Biology|publisher=Princeton University Press, Princeton|year=1978|volume=12|isbn=978-0-691-02361-8|pages=21–22|pmid=740003}} < /ref >

 [[File:Ants in amber.jpg|thumb|right|Ants fossilised in [[Baltic amber]]]] 
 
 The family Formicidae belongs to the order [[Hymenoptera]], which also includes [[bee]]s, [[sawflies]] and [[wasp]]s. Ants evolved from a lineage within the [[Vespoidea|vespoid]] wasps. 
 
 [[Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that ants arose in the [[Lower Cretaceous]] period about 110 to 130 & nbsp;million years ago, or even earlier.

 During the Cretaceous period, a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the [[Laurasia]]n super-continent (the northern hemisphere). They were scarce in comparison to other insects, representing about 1% of the insect population. 
 
 Ants became dominant after [[adaptive radiation]] at the beginning of the [[Cainozoic]]. By the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] ants had come to represent 20-40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the [[Eocene]] epoch, approximately one in ten genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in [[Baltic amber]] fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] amber fossils (apparently early Miocene). < ref name= " grimaldi2001 " / > < ref name= " Ants " > {{cite book| last1 = Holldobler| first1 = Bert| last2 = Wilson| first2 = Edward O.| title = The Ants| year = 1998| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-3-540-52092-4 }} < /ref > < sup > p23 < /sup >

 == Development and reproduction == 
 [[File:Meat eater ant nest swarming02.jpg|thumb|Meat eater ant nest during swarming.]] 
 
 The life of an ant starts from an [[egg (biology)|egg]]. If the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female ([[diploid]]); if not, it will be male ([[haploid]]). Ants develop by [[complete metamorphosis]] with the [[larva]]l stages passing through a [[pupa]]l stage before emerging as an adult. The larva is fed and cared for by workers. 
 
 Food is given to the larvae by [[trophallaxis]], a process in which an ant [[Regurgitation|regurgitates]] liquid food held in its [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. This is also how adults share food, stored in the 'social stomach', among themselves. 
 
 Larvae may also be given solid food brought back by foraging workers, and may even be taken to captured prey in some species. The larvae grow through a series of [[moult]]s and enter the pupal stage. < ref > {{cite book| last = Gillott| first = Cedric| title = Entomology| year = 1995| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-0-306-44967-3| page = 325 }} < /ref > 
 
 The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different [[Polyphenism|caste]]s of workers, is influenced in some species by the food the larvae get. [[Genetics|Genetic]] influences, and the control of [[gene expression]] by the feeding are complex. The determination of caste is a major subject of research. < ref name=Ants/ > < sup > p351, 372 < /sup > < ref > {{cite journal|title=The causes and consequences of genetic caste determination in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|first1=Kirk E.|last1=Anderson|first2=Timothy A.|last2=Linksvayer|first3=Chris R.|last3=Smith|journal=Myrmecol.

 A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. It then does digging and other nest work, and later, defends the nest and forages. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called ''temporal castes''. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants that are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes. < ref > {{cite journal|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|year=1989|volume=34|pages=191–210|title=Foraging strategies of ants|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_annual-review-of-entomology_1989_34/page/191|author=Traniello JFA|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.34.010189.001203}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|author=Sorensen A, Busch TM, Vinson SB|title=Behavioral flexibility of temporal sub-castes in the fire ant, ''Solenopsis invicta'', in response to food|journal=Psyche|volume=91|pages=319–332|year=1984|issue=3–4|doi=10.1155/1984/39236|doi-access=free}} < /ref > 
 
 === Mating === 
 Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females can mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens ([[polygyny]]). The life history of ''Harpegnathos saltator'' is 
 exceptional among ants because both queens and some workers 
 reproduce sexually. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Peeters C, Holldobler B|year=1995|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=92|pages=10977–10979|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/92/24/10977.pdf|title=Reproductive cooperation between queens and their mated workers: The complex life history of an ant with a valuable nest|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.24.10977|pmid=11607589|issue=24|pmc=40553|bibcode=1995PNAS...9210977P|doi-access=free}} < /ref > 
 
 The winged male ants, called ''drones'', emerge from pupae with the breeding females (although some species, like [[army ant]]s, have wingless queens), and do nothing in life except eat and mate. 
 
 ==== The nuptial flight ==== 
 Most ants produce a new generation each year. < ref name= " bloodywasp " > {{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Richard W.|year=2007 |chapter=Bloody funny wasps!

Wilson – 50 years of contributions. Memoirs of the American Entomological Institute, 80|publisher=American Entomological Institute}} < /ref >  During the species specific breeding period, new reproductives, winged males and females leave the colony in what is called a ''nuptial flight''. Typically, the males take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating [[pheromone]] that females follow. Females of some species mate with just one male, but in some others they may mate with anywhere from one to ten or more different males. < ref name=Ants/ >  Mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females store the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] they obtain during their nuptial flight to selectively fertilise future eggs. 
 
 The first workers to hatch are weak and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food and care for the other eggs. This is how new colonies start in most species. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, < ref name =Ants/ > < sup > p143 < /sup >  a process akin to [[swarm]]ing in [[honeybee]]s.

 Ants are active all year long in the tropics but, in cooler regions, survive the winter in a state of dormancy or inactivity. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state ([[diapause]]), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Kipyatkov V.E|year=2001|title=Seasonal life cycles and the forms of dormancy in ants (Hymenoptera, Formicoidea)|journal=Acta Societatis Zoologicae Bohemicae|volume=65|issue=2|pages=198–217}} < /ref > 
 
 == Uses == 
 It may seem strange that ants have uses, but there are some. Some people use ants for food, medicine and rituals. Some species of ants are used for [[Pest (biology)|pest control]] (they eat pests that destroy food for humans). They can damage crops and enter buildings, though. Some species, like the [[fire ant|red imported fire ant]], live in places where they came to by complete accident.
