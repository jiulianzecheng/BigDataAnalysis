'''Franchising''' is a [[business]] method that involves the [[licence|licensing]] of [[trademark]]s and methods of doing business. That can be [[chain store]]s, which are [[retail]] outlets which share a [[Trademark|brand]] and central management, but also an exclusive right to sell branded [[Product (business)|merchandise]]. A similar case is a [[media franchise]], the ownership of the characters and setting of a [[movie]], [[video game]], [[book]], or [[toys]] etc., particularly in North American usage. Examples include [[Pok√©mon]], [[Harry Potter]] or [[Barbie]].
