 '''Utilitarianism''' is the view that the right thing to do is whatever is most [[wikt:useful|useful]]. < ref > {{cite dictionary|entry=Utilitarianism|dictionary=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=5th|year=2011|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}} < /ref >  It is a {{c|Philosophical movements and positions|philosophical position}} about [[ethics]]. The word  " utilitarianism "  comes from the word  " utility " , which means  " usefulness " . < ref > {{cite dictionary|entry=Utility|dictionary=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=5th|year=2011|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}} < /ref >  In most forms of utilitarianism, things that increase human [[wikt:well-being|well-being]] or [[happiness]] are called useful. This is not limited to the happiness caused by a single action but also includes the happiness of all people involved and all future [[consequentialism|consequences]]. 
 
 In general, the [[theory]] of utilitarianism is that whatever brings the most happiness to the greatest number of people is the right thing to do.

 The theory was made popular by [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century]] [[England|British]] [[philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Francis Hutcheson]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], and [[John Stuart Mill]], but the idea goes all the way back to [[Ancient history|ancient]] times. 
 
 Bentham wrote about this idea with the words  " The greatest good for the greatest number, "  but did not use the word ''utilitarianism''. It was Mill, a follower of Bentham's ideas, who named the idea. 
 
 == Utilitarianism in Practice ==

For instance, according to utilitarianism we should help [[Poverty|the poor]], prevent animal suffering, and ensure that future generations have good lives. < ref > {{Cite web|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2021|title=Acting on Utilitarianism â€“ Utilitarianism.net|url=https://www.utilitarianism.net/acting-on-utilitarianism|access-date=2021-05-08|website=Introduction to Utilitarianism: An Online Textbook|language=en-US}} < /ref >
