[[File:Hectagon.png|thumb|A hectogon]] 
 A '''hectogon''' or '''hectagon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 100 sides and 100 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular hectogon == 
 All sides of a '''regular hectogon''' are the same length. Each corner is 176.4°. All corners added together equal 17640°. 
 
 === Area === 
 The [[area]] of a [[Regular polygon|regular]] hectogon of side length ''a'' is given by 
 : < math > A = 25a^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{100} \simeq 795.513 a^2 < /math >
