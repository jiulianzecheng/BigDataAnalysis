 ==History== 
 The stadium was built from 1952 till 1953 and was in the beginning a multipurpose stadium with a running track. During the construction of new stands the track was used so today the stadium is de facto a pure football stadium. It is the homeground of both Lustenau clubs in Austrias First league. Originally it was the homeground of Austria Lustenau, but after the promotion of FC Lustenau to the first league their stadium was not good enough for the league. The stadium offers 8 800 places, 2.126 roofed seats, 2.390 roofed and 4.284 unroofed  standing room. 
 
 On 3 August 2007 the chapel of the stadium was consecrate, where fans of Austria Lustenau can merry. It is named after Hugo Kleinbrod, who cared after the 2. World War for children and orphans. 
 
 In May 2011 supporters of FC Lustenau coloured the main stand and a cash desk in their club colour blue, although they were originally green, which is Austrias colour. < ref > [http://vorarlberg.orf.at/stories/446062/ ORF Vorarlberg Stories (German)]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >
