 A '''colloid''' is a [[mixture]] of one substance spread out evenly inside another substance. They can be in two different [[phase]]s or [[states of matter]].  
 
 One substance is the '''dispersion medium''', such as [[water]] or [[gas]]. The other is the '''[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(chemistry) dispersed medium]''', sometimes called the 'internal phase'. This is usually tiny [[solid]] [[particle]]s. Otherwise, if the dispersion medium is a gas, then the internal phase can be either tiny particles or tiny droplets of a [[liquid]]. 
 
 Definition: A '''colloid''' is a substance microscopically [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(chemistry) dispersed] evenly throughout another substance. < ref > {{Cite web

 Examples:  
 #[[Milk]] is an [[emulsion]], which is a colloid in which both parties are liquids. 
 #[[Shaving cream]] and [[whipped cream]] are colloids of gas inside a liquid. 
 #[[Gel]]s, such as [[agar]], [[jelly]] or even [[opal]]s, are colloids of liquids inside solids. 
 #[[Styrofoam]] and [[pumice]] are gases inside solids. 
 #The red colour of [[cranberry glass]] is caused by the reflection of light off [[gold]] particles in the glass. The glass is a colloid of solid particles inside the solid glass. 
 #[[Mud]] is usually considered a suspension because the dirt will settle, but it may be a partial colloid, particularly with very fine-grained [[clay]]. < ref > With a natural substance, it may be only partly colloidal. < /ref > 
 #[[Fog]] is a complex mixture in which [[air]] has both water droplets and solid particles. It may be colloidal in parts.
