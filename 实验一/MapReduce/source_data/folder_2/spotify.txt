 == Content == 
 
 The Spotify web page instantly creates a listing of local music files which the user has stored on their computer or other devices. It does not mechanically duplicate or import the listing of music files. If the user prefers not to use the listing utility it can be inactivated in the preferences software application.  
 The files created on the userâ€™s computer can be imported to any device such as a mobile device with the use of the mobile client, or even upload these files to the Spotify Software Application. Users may only import or copy files that they have legally attained, even though the user has the choice to not utilize the Spotify service to import or copy their content that they have downloaded from other sites illegally online. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/end-user-agreement/|title=Music for everyone.|website=www.spotify.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Controversy == 
 
 In 2023, Spotify acquiesced to pressure from several Israel-aligned and Zionist organizations to remove a Palestinian liberation song, Dammi Falastini by Mohammad Assaf, on the grounds that it is 'anti-Semitic'.
