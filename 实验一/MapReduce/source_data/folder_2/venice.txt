 '''Venice''' is a [[city]] in [[Italy]]. It is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[Veneto]] region, which is in the north-east of the country. The [[population]] of the 'Comune di Venezia', which is Venice, its lagoon and its mainland is 271,367. Area is 412 & nbsp;km². The population of Venice itself keeps on shrinking at an alarming rate and is now under 55000 locals. 
 
 Venice is built on 118 small [[island]]s that are separated by 150 [[canal]]s. People cross the canals by many small [[bridges]]. They can also navigate across the city on boats, both rowing boats and motor boats. The most famous Venetian type of [[boat]] is called a ''[[gondola]]''. The buildings in Venice are very old and attractive, and [[tourism|tourists]] come from all over the world to see them and the canals. This has made Venice one of the most [[famous]] cities in the world. The most famous sights are the [[Rialto Bridge]], [[St Mark's Basilica]] and the [[Doge's Palace]]. 
 It is important to remember that Venice is much more than few landmarks and that we owe the city a lot: from words to objects or services of our daily life. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://veneziaautentica.com/inventions-from-venice-italy/|title=7 things you couldn't live without and never knew you owed Venice, Italy|date=29 March 2017|publisher=}} < /ref >  Its lifestyle and culture are unique in the world and it can get confusing at first. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://veneziaautentica.com/things-about-venice-italy/|title=You asked, we answered: 19 things you might not know about Venice, Italy|date=22 December 2018|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 
 There are several problems in Venice, but it is still the most popular [[tourist]] [[attraction]] in northeast Italy. Venice now has about as many beds for visitors as for inhabitants: about 49,000 each. < ref > {{Cite web|date=16 July 2023|title=Tourists are back. Is it time to tell them to stay away?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/334c8e70-8434-439a-b181-f07c5495af4c|access-date=2023-07-16|website=Financial Times}} < /ref >   Every year the city sinks a few [[millimeters]] because the ground is made from [[mud]]. Eventually, the city might be completely [[underwater]], but that would take decades. Because of this, the Italian government is building the [[MOSE Project]], a state-of-the-art defense against the sea-water flooding, that will safely protect Venice indefinitely. 
 
 ==History== 
 The city was founded by people from the greater Veneto region as a refuge from the [[Barbarian]] [[invasion]]s, when the Western [[Roman Empire]] fell. During the [[Middle Ages]], Venice slowly grew to become an important commercial city. Around the year 1000 & nbsp;AD the [[Republic of Venice]] started to create an empire in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It lasted until 1797, when it was annexed by [[First French Empire|Napoleon's France]]. It then changed hands a few times, becoming a part of [[Austria]] two times, before becoming part of [[Italy]] during the [[Italian unification]]. Venice deeply influenced the Venetian, [[Istria]]n and [[Dalmatia]]n coasts for one thousand years. 
 
 Venice started to lose population after its conquest by Napoleon, but with the [[unification of Italy]] the city returned to be an important city. It is actually one of the most visited places on [[Earth]] by tourists from all around the globe. 
 
 ==Tourism== 
 {{Wikivoyage-inline}} 
 
 There are several ways to get around in Venice. The most common is walking and using the vaporetto, which is a water bus which carries lots of people around the city. The vaporetto goes around the city and on the Grand Canal, it does not enter the small canals of the city. To see Venice from the small canals, most tourists use the [[gondola]]. Taxi boats can also be used to move around the city and its lagoon. The Grand Canal is long and can be crossed only on a few bridges. A simple way to cross it is to take one of the traghetti ([[ferry|ferries]]). The streets, Vaporetti, and traghetti are used by the locals, it is important to remember that they are their ways to move around the city to go to school, work and do their errands. 
 
 Usually, the warmest month is [[July]] and the coolest month is [[January]]. The maximum average precipitation occurs in [[November]]. The season of the acqua alta, high waters, are generally [[November]] to [[February 11|February]]. During the acqua alta season, the city can be partially flooded for a couple of hours on certain days. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://veneziaautentica.com/acqua-alta-venice/|title=People say many things about the phenomenon of acqua alta in Venice. Here is the truth.|date=14 December 2015|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 
 Venice has incredible crafts, culture, and tradition. Shopping for handmade goods such as masks, Murano glass jewels, etc. is a must. These days, however, [[mass tourism]] led Venice to be invaded by many shops selling low-quality souvenirs. 
 
 Thankfully, there is a social enterprise based in Venice, which works closely with the Venetian business owners, shops, restaurants, and bars included. They have a certification process where the local artisan shops attest and commit to selling products that are both '''authentic and sustainable''' as well as to give a '''10% discount''' to the customers carrying a ''' " [http://veneziaautentica.com/become-friend/ Venezia Autentica Friends' Pass] "   < ref > {{cite web|url=https://veneziaautentica.com/become-friend/|title=Become a Friend of Venezia Autentica and Enjoy your Special Treatment in Venice|publisher=}} < /ref >  ( buyable online for only 10 euros).''' The shops are part of the program are easy to spot thanks to a sticker on their door. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-venices-artisans-are-working-to-save-the-city|title=How Venice's Artisans Are Working to Save the City|first=Julia|last=Buckley|website=Condé Nast Traveler|date=14 August 2017 }} < /ref >
