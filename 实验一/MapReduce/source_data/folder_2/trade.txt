[[File:SceneAtClothingSwap.jpg|thumb|Clothing trade]] 
 To '''trade''' is to willingly give [[wikt:thing|things]] or [[Service economy|services]] and get other things or services in return. For example, a [[person]] giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing. The giver gets something back in return. A trade is sometimes also called an  " exchange "  or a  " swap " . 
 
 An early type of trade is barter. [[Barter]] was the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without using of [[money]]. Modern traders commonly buy and sell by the use of money. Trade between two traders is called [[bilateral trade]]. Trade between more than two traders is called [[multilateral trade]]. 
 
 == Terms == 
 The things that are given from one person to the other are called [[Product (consumer goods)|goods]]. 
 
 [[Service]]s can also be part of a trade. One person can do a [[job]] or [[Labour (economics)|work]] for another, and get something in return in a trade. 
 
 [[Money]] can be given in return for a service or for a thing. If money is part of the trade, then the person who gives the money is buying, and the person who gets the money is selling. 
 
 A place where trading takes place is called a [[market]]. 
 
 When there is no money involved in the trade, the trade is called [[barter]]. If there is money involved in the trade, the trade is called a [[wikt:purchase|purchase]]. In the past, people would [[barter]] to get what they wanted, instead of buying goods and services. 
 
 [[Economics]] includes the study of trade. 
 
 Trade occurs not just between people, but also between large [[company|companies]] and even countries. [[Government]]s sometimes take some of the money or goods involved in a trade between [[countries]]. This is a type of [[tax]] called a [[tariff]]. [[Smuggling|Smugglers]] try to trade without paying tariffs. 
 
 [[Free trade]] between two countries is when there are small or no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on trade. When one country stops all trade with another country, it is called an [[embargo]].
