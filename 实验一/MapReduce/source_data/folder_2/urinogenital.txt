'''Urinogenital''' is a term for the common [[urine|urinal]] and sex passage (opening) in [[mammals]]. In females it is called the [[vagina]], and in males it is called the [[penis]]. Mammals have a sepate opening for waste ([[defaecation]]) called the [[anus]]. 
 
 The term contrasts with that of [[reptiles]] and [[birds]], which have one common opening for sex, urine and defaecation. This is called the [[cloaca]]. < ref > Leonard, Janet L. and Alex CÃ³rdoba-Aguilar 2010. ''The evolution of primary sexual characters in animals''.
