Neopets has story [[plot]]s, [[Internet forum|chat boards]], and different things that users can do with their Neopets. Many people of many different ages join Neopets. The site has many games that the user can play.  Neopets has a help section to find answers to many of the questions that users may have. The games length varies from a minute or less to saveable games like Neoquest that take more than 10 hours total to complete. 
 
 ==Pets== 
 
 A person can make a pet and care for it using items. Items are given when a person does activities on the website. Items can also be purchased using Neopoints, the website's form of money. They can get special items called paint brushes which change the color of the pet to a different special color. 
 
 People younger than thirteen years old have less access to website features. They are not allowed to use the forum or send messages to other people. 
 ===Default avatars=== 
 Default avatars are the easiest type of avatar to get. Once a person creates an account on Neopets, they get to use the default avatars without having to do anything. Default avatars are mainly the different pets that can be used on the site and certain [[fairy|faeries]]. 
 
 ===Clickable avatars=== 
 Clickable avatars are the second easiest avatar to get. To earn a Clickable, the user must go to a certain [[web page|place]] on the site. Once the user has gone to that page, they get a message that says they can use that avatar. 
 
 ===Avatars that are earned=== 
 Many avatars have to be earned. These are the avatars that people want most. These avatars are the hardest to get. These avatars may be gotten in many different ways. For example, getting a certain [[score]] in a [[game]], buying a specific item, looking up a pet, refreshing, or getting a set amount of Neopoints. 
 
 ==Fan sites== 
 There are many websites created by Neopets users to help other players. These sites help with information about how to play games and how to get avatars. There are also many sites for users to find ways to change the look of the pages that tell about themselves and their pets.
