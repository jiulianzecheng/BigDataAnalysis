'''Translation''' means to copy [[writing]] or [[speech]] from one [[language]] into a different language. 
 
 The people who do translation are called [[translator]]s. A translator who is copying a [[book]] into another language may use a language [[dictionary]] to find out how a word is written in another language. A translator who works with the spoken word is also called an [[interpreter]]. Translators can work independently as freelancers or by being hired by translation agencies. People who translate [[poetry]], novels, [[drama]], or short stories are called literary translators.  
 
 In [[computer]] technology, translation from a [[programming language]] to a [[machine language]] is called [[compile|compiling]]. 
 
 There are free translators on the [[internet]]. A notable example of this is [[Google Translate]].
