A '''[https://sucessmantr.blogspot.com/2021/03/get-free-reward-free-product-by-just.html reward]{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''' is getting something good for doing a given task.  It needs someone who has the power to give the good thing. It is the opposite of [[punishment]]. 
 
 Ideas like [[risk and reward]], [[reward and punishment]] are based on the idea that people do things, or avoid doing things, to get rewards. In [[psychology]] there is another idea that this is not true. This other idea says that training ([[conditioning]]) and emotions ([[affective factor]]s) are much more important than the rewards or punishments given by others. 
 
 In trying to catch criminals and other bad people, the [[government]] often offers money to people. This money is given to people who may capture the criminal, or give information that helps the police catch them. For example, after the [[Eureka Stockade]] [[rebellion]] in [[Ballarat, Victoria]] in 1854, the government offered a big reward of 400 pounds for the capture of the people who had started it.

 In 2001, the US government offered a big reward of 2.5 million dollars for help in capturing the person who had sent [[Anthrax (disease)|anthrax]] in letters to a newspaper [[journalist]] and 2 [[senator]]s. Anthrax is a [[disease]] which can kill people.
