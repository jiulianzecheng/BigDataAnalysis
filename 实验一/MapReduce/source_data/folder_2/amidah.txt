The '''Amidah''' ({{Hebrew|עמידה}},  " standing " ) is one of the two main [[prayer]]s of [[Judaism]].  It has that name because people say it standing up.  [[Jew]]s say it at every [[Jewish prayer services|prayer service]] of the year. 
 
 It is also called ''Shemoneh Esrei'' ({{Hebrew|שמונה עשרה}},  " eighteen " ) because at first the weekday [[wikt:version|version]] of the prayer had eighteen [[blessing]]s.  (It now has nineteen.) In the [[Talmud]], it is called ''Tefilah'' ({{Hebrew|תפילה}}).  This simply means  " prayer " .  It has that name because it is so [[wikt:central|central]] to Judaism. 
 
 ==Blessings of the Amidah== 
 The Amidah always has three sections.   
 *The first section has blessings of praise to God.   
 *The middle section is different between [[weekday]]s and [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays|holidays]].  On weekdays it has blessings asking for God's help.  On Shabbat and holidays there is one blessing to thank God for Shabbat or the holiday. 
 *The last section has blessings to thank God for everything He does for us.

 ==Saying the Amidah== 
 The Amidah is said at least three times every day: at the morning, afternoon and evening prayer services.  A person should say it standing.  A person should say it loud enough to hear it.  But it should be quiet enough that other people cannot hear it. 
 
 At the morning and afternoon services, the Amidah is repeated out loud by the prayer [[leader]].  When the Amidah is said out loud: 
 *The third blessing includes a section called ''Kedushah,'' or  " holiness " , centered around Isaiah's vision of angels declaring God's holiness. < ref > {{bibleref|Isaiah|6:3|HE}} < /ref > 
 *The eighteenth blessing includes a section called ''Modim d'Rabbanan,'' or  " The Rabbis' Prayer of Thanks. "  The Talmud says that everyone must thank God himself or herself, even during public prayer. < ref > Tractate ''Sotah:'' Babylonian Talmud 40a, Jerusalem Talmud 1:8. < /ref > 
 The Amidah is not said out loud at night. 
 
 In [[Reform Judaism]] the Amidah is not said quietly.  It is said out loud at every prayer service. 
 
 ==Changes on Shabbat and Jewish holidays== 
 On Shabbat and important Jewish holidays, the Amidah prayer changes in two important ways. 
 *People do not ask God to help them meet their needs.  The middle section of the weekday Amidah is replaced by one blessing about the holiness of the Shabbat or holiday.  The first three blessings and last three blessings are the same as on weekdays. 
 *The Amidah is said a fourth time. < ref > Reform Jews do not say this Amidah. < /ref >   This Amidah is called the ''musaf,'' or [[wikt:additional|additional]] service.  The middle blessing is about the additional offering given at the Temple in Jerusalem on Shabbat and holidays. < ref > {{bibleref|Numbers|28|HE}} and {{bibleverse-nb|Numbers||29|HE}} < /ref > 
 There are two Amidah prayers during the year that are different from any others.  See the pages on these holidays for more [[information]]. 
 *On [[Rosh Hashanah]], the ''musaf'' Amidah has nine blessings instead of seven. 
 *On [[Yom Kippur]], a ''fifth'' Amidah, called ''Ne'ilah'' ( " closing " ) is said at the very end of the day.

 ==Reference== 
 A ''[[siddur]]'' (Jewish prayer book) is always the best reference for information about Jewish prayers:  
 
 < center > {{cite book |first=Lord Jonathan |last=Sacks |title=The Koren Siddur |edition= Nusaḥ Ashkenaz, 1st Hebrew/English |date=2009 |publisher= Koren Publishers |location= Jerusalem |isbn= 978-965-301-067-3 |mode=cs2}}.  < /center > 
 
 It is a very good English/Hebrew siddur to use for learning about prayers.
