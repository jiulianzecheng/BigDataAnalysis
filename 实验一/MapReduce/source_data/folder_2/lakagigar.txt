 '''Lakagígar''' is a row of spectacular [[crater]]s along twenty-five [[kilometres]] in the southern [[Iceland]]ic Highlands. They formed in the eruptions at '''Lakí''' in 1784. 
 
 The system erupted violently over an eight months between June 1783 and February 1784. [[Lava]] came from the Laki fissure and the adjoining [[volcano]] [[Grímsvötn]]. It poured out an estimated 42 billion tons or {{convert|14|km3|cumi|1|abbr=on}} of [[basalt]] lava and clouds of poisonous [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] compounds. That contaminated the soil, leading to the death of over 50% of Iceland's livestock population, and the destruction of almost all crops. This led to a [[famine]] which killed about 25% of the island's human population. < ref > Gunnar Karlsson 2000. ''Iceland's 1100 Years'', p. 181 < /ref >  The lava flows also destroyed 20 villages.
