 '''Delta''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Δ δ'''), is a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used to represent the  " d "  sound in [[Ancient Greek|Ancient]] and [[Modern Greek language|Modern]] Greek. In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of 4. Letters that came from it include the Roman [[D]] and Cyrillic [[Д]]. 
 
 In [[mathematics]], the upper-case letter Δ can be used as symbol to represent  " [[:wikt:change|change]] "  in a variable (e.g.,  < math > \Delta x < /math > ). It can also be used to represent [[discriminant]]—a key algebraic expression used to determine the number of roots a [[polynomial]] has. The lower-case letter  < math > \delta < /math > , on the other hand, is often used to denote small quantities in [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] involving [[Limit of a function|limit]], a key concept on [[calculus]] is based on. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-18|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 In molecular chemistry, the lower case Greek letter δ is used to represent a partial charge. This is always less than the unit charge associated with an ion, but has no real fixed value. 
 
 A [[river delta]] is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta.
