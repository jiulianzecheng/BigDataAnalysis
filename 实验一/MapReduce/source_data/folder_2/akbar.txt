 Akbar became the ''[[de jure]]'' king in 1556 at the age of 13 when his father died. Akbar was too young to rule, so Bairam Khan was appointed as Akbar's [[regent]] and chief army commander. Soon after coming to power Akbar defeated Himu, the general of the Afghan forces, in the Second Battle of Panipat. After a few years, he ended the regency of Bairam Khan and took charge of the kingdom. He initially offered friendship to the [[Rajput]]s. However, he had to fight against some Rajputs who opposed him. In 1576 he defeated [[Maharana Pratap]] of [[Mewar]] in the Battle of Haldighati. Akbar's wars made the Mughal empire more than twice as big as it had been before, covering most of the [[Indian subcontinent]] except the south (excluding the [[Deccan Plateau]]).

 * The revenue department was headed by a ''[[Vizier|wazir]]'', responsible for all finances and management of ''jagir'' and ''inamdar'' feudal lands. 
 * The head of the military was called the ''mir bakshi'', appointed from among the leading nobles of the court. The ''mir bakshi'' was in charge of intelligence gathering, and also made recommendations to the emperor for military appointments and promotions.:) 
 * The ''mir saman'' was in charge of the imperial household, including the [[harem]]s, and supervised the functioning of the court and royal bodyguard. 
 * The judiciary was a separate organization headed by a chief ''qazi'', who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices. in 
 
 == Religious policy == 
 Akbar was a Muslim. He realized that to establish a strong empire, he had to gain the confidence of his Hindu people who were the majority in India. 
 
 Din-i-ilahi (''Religion of God'') was a religious path suggested by Akbar. It was a code of moral conduct which reflected Akbar's secular ideas and he desire to achieve peace, unity, tolerance in his empire. Belief in one god, worship of source of light, non-killing of animals, Having peace with all were some features of Din-i-ilahi. It didn't have any rituals, holy books, temples or priests. 
 
 Male [[circumcision]] was not to be done before the boy was 12 years old, and after that it was optional. It was a Jewish custom adopted by Islam. Akbar's rule was that it should be made optional and should be done, if at all, at an age when boys could understand what it was. Here Akbar gave every man a choice and opportunity to have a play of his reason. Indeed, the boy of reason as he was, he could not deny it to others.  
 
 When he was at Fatehpur Sikri, he held discussions as he loved to know about others' religious beliefs. On one such day, he got to know that the religious people of other religions were often bigots (intolerant of others religious beliefs). This led him to form the idea of the new religion, Sulh-e-kul meaning ''universal peace''. His idea of this religion did not discriminate other religions and focused on the ideas of peace, unity and tolerance. This gesture of his made the Hindus and people of other religions call him with different names and start loving him. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_12.html | title=Part2_12 }} < /ref >
