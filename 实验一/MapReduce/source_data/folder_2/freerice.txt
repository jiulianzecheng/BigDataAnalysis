 '''''FreeRice''''' is a [[non-profit]] organization that donates rice to the [[Poverty|hungry people around the world]]. Players choose an answer from a multiple-choice question. As the player gets more right answers, they advance in level. The highest level depends on the subject. 
 
 ==Donation== 
 
 In 2008, FreeRice became economically sufficient to donate 20 grains of rice per answer instead of 10. Unfortunately, the economic landslide of 2009 reduced the grains per answer back down to 10.
