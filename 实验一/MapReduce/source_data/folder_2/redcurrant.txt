 A '''redcurrant''' (''Ribes rubrum'') is a type of [[fruit]]. It is related to the [[blackcurrant]]. They are in the same genus ''[[Ribes]]''. They can be found growing in the wild in western Europe ([[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and northern [[Italy]]). 
 
 The redcurrant is more tart than the blackcurrant. Redcurrants are used in jams and other cooked foods.
