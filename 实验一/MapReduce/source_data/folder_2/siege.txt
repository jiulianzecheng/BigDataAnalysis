{{War}} 
 A '''siege''' is a [[military]] [[blockade]] of a [[city]] or [[fortress]]. The purpose is to conquer by [[starvation]], [[drought|lack of water]], or by a well-prepared assault.  
 
 Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict. The defender inside has a strong, static, defensive position. [[Negotiation]] between combatants is common. 
 
 A siege happens when the attacker gets to a city or [[fortress]] which cannot be taken by storm, and which refuses to surrender. Sieges block the  supplies and reinforcements or escape of men. Siege engines, artillery bombardment, and undermining are frequent. Deception and treachery are common. 
 
 Sieges can be decided by starvation, thirst, or disease. This form of siege can take many months or even years, depending upon the size of the stores of food the fortified position holds.
