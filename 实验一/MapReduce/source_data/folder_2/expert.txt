An expertâ€™s corresponding ability or '''expertise''' is, mostly, based on his/her  credential, [[training]], [[education]], [[profession]], [[publication]] or [[experience]]. Historically, an expert was referred to as a ''wise old man''. Such individual was usually a profound [[intellectual]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]]. < ref > [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wise+man Wise man] < /ref >  In law, an expert [[witness]] may contribute specialized knowledge of a field. 
 
 Someone who is not an expert may be called a [[beginner]] or a [[novice]] if they are new to that field.
