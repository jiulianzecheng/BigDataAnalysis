 The [[mineral]] '''pyrite''', < ref > The name pyrite is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] '''''πυρίτης''''' (puritēs),  " of fire "  or  " in fire " , from ''πύρ'' (pur),  " fire " . < /ref >  or '''iron pyrite''', is an [[iron sulfide]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[iron|Fe]][[sulphur|S]] < sub > 2 < /sub > . This mineral's metallic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] and pale-to-normal, brass-yellow colour have earned it the nickname '''fool's gold''' because of its resemblance to [[gold]]. < ref > Julia A.

 == History == 
 Pyrite is the most common sulphide mineral. In ancient Roman times, the name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when it was struck against [[steel]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] described one of them as being brassy, which was almost certainly a reference to what is now called pyrite. < ref > James Dwight Dana, Edward Salisbury Dana, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lHS7AAAAIAAJ & pg=PA86 Descriptive Minerology, 6th ed.], Wiley, New York (1911) p86. < /ref > 
 
 By [[Georgius Agricola]]'s time, the term had become a generic term for all sulphide minerals. < ref > [[Herbert Clark Hoover]] and [[Lou Henry Hoover]], translators of [[Georgius Agricola]], [De Re Metallica], The Mining Magazine, London (1912; Dover reprint, 1950); see footnote, p. 112. < /ref > 
 
 Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulphides or [[oxide]]s in [[quartz]] [[vein (geology)|veins]], [[sedimentary rock]], and [[metamorphic rock]], as well as in [[coal]] beds and as a replacement mineral in [[fossil]]s. Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small amounts of gold.
