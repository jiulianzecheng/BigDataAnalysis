 == Discovery and description ==

 [[Fossil]]s of ''Shonisaurus'' were first found in a large deposit in [[Nevada]] in 1920. Thirty years later, they were excavated, uncovering the remains of 37 very large ichthyosaurs. These were named ''Shonisaurus'', ( " Lizard from the Shoshone Mountains " ). ''Shonisaurus'' lived 216–203 million years ago. 
 
 ''S. popularis'' was about 15 metres (50 & nbsp;ft) long. A longer specimen is now placed in  ''[[Shastasaurus]]'' rather than ''Shonisaurus''. ''Shonisaurus'' had a long pointed mouth that contained [[teeth]] only at the front end. < ref name = Hilton/ >  It had a large [[whale]]-like body, a long [[dolphin]]-like snout, and its flippers were much longer, and narrower than in other ichthyosaurs. All of these features suggest that ''Shonisaurus'' may be a relatively specialised offshoot of the main ichthyosaur evolutionary line. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|pages= [https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7/page/78 78]–79|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref > 
 < !--Thus, due to being, perhaps, a slow-moving animal, it may have fed like a modern-day [[whale shark]], taking large amounts of small prey. Whale sharks sometimes feed on schooling fish, and small sharks and the extinct [[Saurichthys]], along with ammonites, belemnites and squid, would've supplemented Shonisaurus.-- > 
 
 == Fossils == 
 The first species discovered, ''S. popularis'', was adopted as the state fossil of Nevada in 1984. Excavations, begun in 1954 under the direction of Charles Camp and Samuel Welles of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], were continued by Camp throughout the 60s. < ref name = Hilton/ > 
 
 The Nevada fossil is at the [[Berlin–Ichthyosaur State Park]], [[Nevada]], USA. The park has several undisturbed [[ichthyosaur]] [[fossil]]s of the species ''Shonisaurus popularis'' as well as the early-20th Century [[ghost town]] of Berlin.  The park is about {{convert|150|mi|km}} east of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. 
 
 The discovery of ''S. sikkanniensis'' in [[British Columbia]] in the 1990s made ''S. popularis'' the smaller of the ''Shonisaurus'' species. An [[ichthyosaur]] found in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] mountains called ''Himalayasaurus'', may be the same animal as ''Shonisaurus''. 
 
 === British Columbia specimen === 
 [[Image:Royal Tyrell Shonisaurus.jpg|thumb|''S. sikanniensis'' at Royal Tyrrell Museum]]  
 The British Columbia specimen was described as follows: 
 : " The ichthyosaur ''Shonisaurus sikanniensis''... type specimen is considerably larger than ''Shonisaurus popularis'', with an estimated length of 21 m. It also differs from ''S. popularis'' in having a fan-shaped [[scapula]], and relatively longer [[vertebra]]l centra... Teeth are set in sockets, but are known only in a few, small individuals. This implies that teeth were present only in juveniles, and that adults were edentulous (without teeth). < ref name=giant/ > 
 
 : " Isolated elements from other localities suggest that larger individuals existed... The [site] ... is from the final stage of a late Triassic marine transgression (deepening) along the noth-west coast of [[Pangea]]. It was deposited in a deep-water, distal shelf setting, well below wave base " . < ref name=giant/ > 
 
 == Life-style == 
 Its slender skull and lack of teeth except at the front are obvious adaptations to its method of feeding. They are like those of modern whales which feed on [[squid]], such as the [[pilot whale]] and [[sperm whale]]. < ref > McGowan, Christopher 1997.
