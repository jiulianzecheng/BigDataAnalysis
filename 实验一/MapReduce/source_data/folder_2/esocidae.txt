 '''Esocidae''' is a family of fish in the order [[Esociformes]], which contains pike, pickerel, and mudminnows. 
 
 ==Studies== 
 While the family only contained the genus ''[[Esox]]'', recent studies have recovered ''[[Novumbra]]'' and ''[[Dallia]]'' as members of the family Esocidae, being closer related to ''Esox'' than ''[[Umbra (fish)|Umbra]]''. Fossil specimens from the Mesozoic in North America have been assigned as two additional genera in this family.
