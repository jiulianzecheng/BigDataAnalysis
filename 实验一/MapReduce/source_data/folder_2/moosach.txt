 '''Moosach''' is a [[Municipalities of Germany|municipality]] in the [[Upper Bavaria]]n district of [[Ebersberg (district)|Ebersberg]] and a member of the ''Verwaltungsgemeinschaft'' (administrative community) of Glonn. 
 
 == Geography == 
 The community is in a picturesque setting in an [[Ice age|ice-age]] [[moraine]] landscape about 500 & nbsp;m in elevation and lends itself well to [[hiking]]. In the heights of the moraine that ring the town are lakes, among them the Steinsee, a bathing lake also favoured by visitors from [[Munich]]. Somewhat farther away is the Kitzlsee, a protected landscape. 
 
 Moosach comprises a number of surrounding hamlets and lone homesteads such as Falkenberg (with a stable and a beergarden), Baumhau, Altenburg and Berghofen.
