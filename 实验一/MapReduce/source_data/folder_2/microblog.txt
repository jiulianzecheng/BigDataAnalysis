A '''microblog''' is a form of a [[blog]] where people send short messages of text or [[media]] (pictures, video, or sounds). These messages can be sent to a [[website]] and shown to either a small group or to the public. A  " microblogger "  (someone who uses a microblog) could send their messages from different sources including cell phone text messages, email, [[instant messaging|instant messages]] or through a [[website]].  
 
 A microblog is usually different from a normal [[blog]]. It has much smaller pieces.  A microblog entry can be just one sentence, or a link to an [[image]] or short [[video]]. A person writing a microblog can use many ideas from  " what am I doing now, "  to Race cars  or [[politics]] or information about their business or personal life. 
 
 ==Services== 
 
 Micro blogs are in use in many ways on different websites. They became popular with sites like [[Twitter]] where people send messages to each other with text comments or links to other media. Newer sites are also available now which allow you to share media like videos, pictures or sounds directly instead of sending a link.  
 
 Many [[social networking]] sites (such as [[Facebook]] or [[MySpace]]) use a type of microblogging using ''status updates'' where the person tells their friends what they are thinking or doing.  
 
 ==Usage== 
 
 A [[Harvard]] Business School study found that while most social networking websites are more popular with women microblogging, like [[Twitter]], has been much more popular with men. Both men and women  " followed "  more men, this allows them to receive the messages that get sent out by the person they followed.  < ref name= " hbs " > {{Cite web|url=http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/cs/2009/06/new_twitter_research_men_follo.html|title=New Twitter Research: Men Follow Men and Nobody Tweets| work=[[Harvard Business School]] | date=2009-06-01|accessdate=2009-10-22}} < /ref > 
 
 Micro blogs have also become new sources for news that just happened or is still happening, such as the [[terrorist]] attacks on [[Mumbai]] in November 2008. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/26/first-hand-accounts-of-terrorist-attacks-in-india-on-twitter/|work=[[TechCrunch]] |title=First Hand Accounts Of Terrorist Attacks In India On Twitter, Flickr| date=2008-11-26|accessdate=2009-10-22}} < /ref > 
 
 == Microblogging at work == 
 A new idea for Micro blogging has been to turn it into a way to talk to other people about work. It allows a person to give quick news or information to the people they work without sending a lot of [[email]]s and without the [[spam]] they get in their email account. New companies such as [[Yammer]] have been started who want to help allow workers to talk to each other with about work and share what they need.  < ref name= " nyt " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/technology/start-ups/21twitter.html|work=[[New York Times]]|title=Twitter and Yammer Test Dot-Com Business Models| date=2008-10-20|accessdate=2009-10-22}} < /ref >
