'''Barabbas''' is a person from the [[Bible]] who lived around the time of [[Jesus]] (33 AD). He has a bad [[reputation]] for being a [[Lying|liar]], [[Theft|thief]], [[Rebellion|insurrectionist]] and [[zealot]]. He was released by [[Pontius Pilate]] the Roman governor of [[Judea]] < ref > Matthew 27;2; Luke 3:1 < /ref >  who presided over Jesus' trial. < ref > Matthew 27:11; Mark 15:2; Luke 23:1; John 18:28-38 < /ref >  The most notable thing about Barabbas is that this name was his [[surname]] (last name), but his first name was also Jesus. So when Pilate — who was warned by his wife to leave this Holy man alone — < ref > Matthew 27:19 < /ref >  offered to set free one of the prisoners, he was offering the crowd in Jerusalem two Jesuses to choose from: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus of Nazareth. Pilate released Barabbas and ordered Jesus, < ref > Matthew 27:26 < /ref >   " King of the Jews " , < ref > John 19:15,19-22 < /ref >  to be [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]]. < ref > Matthew 27:24; Mark 15:15; Luke 23:24,25; John 19:16,18 < /ref >
