 The '''Benelux''' is an [[economic union]] in [[Western Europe]]. It includes three neighboring [[monarchy|monarchies]], [[Belgium|'''Be'''lgium]], the [[Netherlands|'''Ne'''therlands]], and [[Luxembourg|'''Lux'''embourg]]. They are in the north western European region between [[France]] and [[Germany]]. The name is formed from the beginning of each country's name. The Benelux region has a total [[population]] of about 27,562,220 and an area of about 74,640 km² (28,819 sq mi). 
 
 == History == 
 On 25 july 1921, the [[Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union|Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union]] was established, a treaty which is still upheld. Following [[World War II]], the harsh economic climate in [[Europe]] led to a further desire for economic cooporation between Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands. The '''Benelux Customs Convention''' was signed in [[London]] on 5 September 1944, by the three governments-in-exile in [[London]]. The treaty officially entered into force in 1948. On 1 November 1960, the customs union was superseded by the ''Benelux Economic Union'' treaty'','' signed in [[The Hague]] on 3 February 1958. The treaty contributed to the founding of the [[European Union]] (EU), serving as a proving ground for succesful economic cooperation within Europe. 
 
 == Politics == 
 A Benelux Parliament (originally referred to as ''Interparliamentary Consultative Council'') was created in 1955. This parliamentary assembly is composed of 21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourgish parliament. The treaty establishing the '''Benelux Economic Union''' (''Benelux Economische Unie/Union Économique Benelux'') was signed 3 February 1958 and came into force in 1960 to promote the free movement of [[worker]]s, [[capital (economics)|capital]], [[Service (economics)|services]], and [[good (economics)|goods]] in the region. Its secretariat-general is located in [[Brussels]].  
 
 == Law == 
 In 1965, the treaty establishing a '''Benelux Court of Justice''' was signed. It entered into force in 1975. The Court, composed of judges from the highest courts of the three States, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of common legal rules. This international judicial institution is in Brussels. 
 
 The Benelux is particularly active in the field of [[intellectual property]]. The three countries established a '''Benelux Trademarks Office''' and a '''Benelux Designs Office''', both in [[The Hague]]. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing a '''[[Benelux Office for Intellectual Property|Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property]]''' which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on 1 September 2006.
