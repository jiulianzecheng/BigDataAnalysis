 A '''gribble''' is any species of marine [[isopod]] from the family '''Limnoriidae'''. They are mostly pale white and small (1-4  & nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] long) [[crustacean]]s.  
 
 The term gribble was originally used for the wood-boring species, especially the first species described from Norway by Rathke in 1799, ''Limnoria lignorum''. The Limnoriidae have species which bore into [[seaweed]] and [[sea grass]], as well as wood borers.  
 
 There are three genera, ''Paralimnoria'', ''Limnoria'' and ''Lynseia''. ''Limnoria'' has species in most seas. Those gribbles able to bore into living [[Ocean|marine]] [[plant]]s are thought to have evolved from a [[wood]] (dead plant) boring species.  
 
 Gribbles bore into wood and plant material for food. The [[cellulose]] of wood is digested. The most destructive species are ''Limnoria lignorum'', ''L. tripunctata'' and ''L. quadripunctata''. According to an expert, they are the only animals able to make a cellulase to dissolve plant [[cell wall]]s. < ref name= " bio " / >  Other animals that eat plant fibres make use of [[bacteria]] in their gut to produce the [[enzyme]]. Gribbles do not. This has led some biologists to think of biofuels. < ref name= " bio " > Gribbles, cellulase and biofuel: [http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/pressreleases/gribble.htm]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >
