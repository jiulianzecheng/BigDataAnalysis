 '''Briefs''' are a type of short [[underwear]] for males or females. They provide a close fit, and come in either [[white]], or in other colors like [[blue]], [[pink]], or [[red]]. 
 
 For male briefs, before the 2000s, briefs often came with hard elastic waistbands. This would cause [[stretch mark]]s, and this was eventually replaced by the soft elastic waistband. However, hard elastic waistbands are still found on generic store brand underwear (that save consumer and manufacturing costs by not being [[fashion]] forward). 
 
 Female briefs are also called [[knickers]] or [[panties]].
