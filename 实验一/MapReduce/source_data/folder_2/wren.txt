 The '''wrens''' are [[passerine]] birds in the mainly [[New World]] [[family (biology)|family]] '''Troglodytidae'''. There are about 80 [[species]] in about 20 [[genera]]. The Wren is also the shortest bird in Britain. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.livingwithbirds.com/tweetapedia/21-facts-on-wren|title=21 Facts on Wren - Tweetapedia - Living with Birds|website=www.livingwithbirds.com|access-date=2020-07-20}} < /ref > 
 
 Originally, the word 'wren' was (and still is) used for the [[species]] found in [[Europe]], western [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]. The word came into English after a long history in the [[German language|Germanic languages]]. The bird's scientific name is ''Troglodytes troglodytes''. < ref > [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150417-vote-for-britains-national-bird ''BBC News''] < /ref > < ref name=Britannica > {{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649412/wren |title=wren (bird) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |first= |encyclopedia=britannica.com |year=2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}} < /ref >  When European biologists got to the [[Americas]], they soon realised that the family of wrens has many species, and is mainly an American family of birds. 
 
 Most wrens are about 10 centimetres (4 inches) long, brown (both sexes), and has a short bill that curves slightly down. < ref name=Britannica/ >  Its wings are round and it has a short tail. 
 
 ==Vocalizations== 
 Its song is a gushing burst of sweet music, loud and emphatic. It has an enormous voice for its size, ten times louder, weight for weight, than a [[chicken|cockerel]]. Its song may sometimes be confused for the [[dunnock]], which has warble that is shorter and weaker. The wren's song also has trill sounds, which the dunnock does not. The male has a long and complex song, with a series of tinkling trills one after the other for seconds on end. < ref name= " HBW10 " > del Hoyo J; Elliott A.  &  Christie D. 2005.

 When this bird is annoyed or excited, its call runs into an emphatic ''churr'', like [[clockwork]] running down.
