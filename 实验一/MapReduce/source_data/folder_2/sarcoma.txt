As a result, there are many subtypes of sarcoma. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/metastatic-cancer|title=Metastatic Cancer|date=2015-05-12|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-03-22}} < /ref >  The word sarcoma is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:σάρξ|σάρξ]] ''sarx'' meaning  " flesh " . < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sarcoma|title=Definition of SARCOMA|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-22}} < /ref >
