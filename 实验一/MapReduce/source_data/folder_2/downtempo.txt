'''Downtempo''' (sometimes known as ''chill out'', ''chill'' or ''downbeat'') is a music style with [[electronic music]]. It is similar to [[ambient music]], but usually with a [[rhythm|beat]] or [[Groove (music)|groove]]. < ref > {{cite web | title=Pandora FAQ | url=http://blog.pandora.com/faq/index.html#310 | accessdate=2009-09-15 | archive-date=2010-02-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208213314/http://blog.pandora.com/faq/index.html#310 | url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 
 The [[tempo]], as well as the drum patterns of each track can vary. Sometimes the beat can be restrained and/or simple. Sometimes the beats are more complicated and more featured instead of being in the background, but even then they are usually less intense than other kinds of electronic music like [[trance music|trance]] and [[house music|house]]. The tempo is often slower than that of traditional [[electronic dance music]]. Often the name [[chill-out music]] is used to refer to songs demonstrative of the genre, but those names also refer to other styles of music, and downtempo encompasses a wider variety of styles than those terms alone would indicate. Because of the relaxing and often sensual or romantic feel of most downtempo music, it is a popular form of background music in 'chill out rooms' of dance parties, and many alternative cafes.
