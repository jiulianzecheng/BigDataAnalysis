 ==Gameplay== 
 The player in a [[First person (video games)|first-person view]] controls the lone survivor of a crashed ship. The objective is to explore the planet and collect resources to survive, the player must make sure to not run out of [[oxygen]] and keep fed and hydrated. The player can create bases and build vehicles. The game uses a day and night cycle. 
 
 == Plot == 
 The universe of ''Subnautica'' takes place in the 22nd century. 
 
 The player is the lone survivor of the crash of the Aurora on a planet designated 4546B. The Aurora is a vessel owned by the Alterra corporation. The Aurora’s primary mission was to build a high speed “Phasegate” to enable travel. Its secret mission was to locate the fate of another vessel called the Degasi, which crashed on the same planet many years prior. 
 
 After crashing into planet 4546B, the player sets out to explore unknown buildings and biomes in the ocean. While exploring planet 4546B, the player discovers an abandoned alien facility, which the player finds an abundant information about the planet. As the player finds crewman logs and alien archives, they discover the Aurora was shot down by an ancient alien quarantine facility to contain a virulent fatal [[bacteria]] known as “Kharaa”. Since the player becomes infected by Kharaa, they cannot deactivate the quarantine protocols. Eventually, the player is contacted by a telepathic being, a Sea Emperor Leviathan. The Sea Emperor explains what the Precursor aliens were attempting to do to find a cure for Kharaa. The Sea Emperor Leviathans produce an enzyme, designated “Enzyme 42”, but adults do not produce enough to be effective. The Precursors died before they could discover the required ingredients necessary to allow the hatching of young Sea Emperors. 
 
 The Sea Emperor was unable to communicate with the Precursors. Since it can communicate with Humans, it asks the player to aide it in collecting the ingredients to hatch their eggs. Once the player completes this task, the player is cured and is able to build a rocket to escape the planet, ending the game. 
 
 ==Development== 
 ''Subnautica'' was announced by Unknown Worlds Entertainment on December 17, 2013. 
 
 They used [[Unity (Game engine)|Unity]] rather then Spark which they used for [[Natural Selection 2]]. 
 
 The development team chose to not include lethal weapons in the game. Charlie Cleveland, the game's director, described ''Subnautica'' as  " one vote towards a world with less guns, " . 
 
 ==Reception== 
 Ian Birnbaum of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' said ''Subnautica'' was an  " underwater ''[[Minecraft]]'' " , saying that  " with an experienced developer at the helm and a limitless variety of the oceans to play with, it’s going to take a lot for ''Subnautica'' to go badly wrong. As the toolbox gets deeper and the shape of the end-game gets set, ''Subnautica'' will be a unique example of the ways survival can be tense, rewarding, and fun. " < ref name= " PC Gamer " / >  Marsh Davies of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' liked the rewarding nature of exploring the world of ''Subnautica'', but disliked that some of the in-game recipes were found by chance. < ref > {{cite web|title=Premature Evaluation: Subnautica|last=Davies|first=Marsh|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/01/05/subnautica-alpha-review/|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=January 5, 2015|access-date=May 12, 2016}} < /ref >
