 '''Cosmetics''' (also called '''makeup''', '''make up''', or '''make-up''') are products used to make the human body look different. Often cosmetics are used to make someone more attractive to one person, or to a culture or sub-culture. In Western culture, women are the main users of cosmetics. Their use by men is less frequent, except on [[stage]], [[television]] and [[movie]]s. Cosmetics are widely used in the world of [[acting]]. < ref > [https://salarship.com/guide/freelance-makeup-artist/ Makeup artist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108200829/https://salarship.com/guide/freelance-makeup-artist/ |date=2020-11-08 }}, Salarship < /ref > 
 
 All cosmetics are temporary. They need to be renewed after a certain time. Cosmetics include [[lipstick]], [[powder]]s (e.g. [[blush]], [[eye]]shadow), and [[sun screen|lotion]]s as well as other things. 
 
 == Facial cosmetics == 
 Most cosmetic products and methods are intended to improve the look of the face.  There are two categories: those which improve the basic quality of the skin, and those which sit on the skin during active social life.  
 
 === Skin care === 
 The purpose here is to clean the skin, improve its basic quality, and prepare it for the application of make-up. Products are of these types: 
 *[[Cleanser]]s, used to remove make-up and clean the skin.  
 *[[Toner (cosmetics)|Toners]], used to remove oil from the skin and close the pores on the skin. 
 *[[Moisturizer]]s, used to make the skin soft and to reduce evaporation of water from the skin. 
 *[[Primer (cosmetics)|Primers]], used to prepare the surface for the later application of make-up. 
 *[[Concealer]]s, to mask flaws or slightly modify the colour of the skin. 
 *[[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]], a product which holds face-powder in place. More generally, it create an even, uniform colour, covers flaws and adjusts the natural skintone. 
 
 === Make-up === 
 These are the cosmetics which the viewer actually sees on the face (or other parts of the body). They are some or all of these: 
 *[[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge]] or blusher: [[talcum]]-based reddish powder, to give a more youthful appearance. Used mainly to emphasize the cheekbones, sometimes to redden the cheeks. Very ancient, used by the [[ancient Egyptians]]. 
 *[[Face powder]].  Or translucent powder applied with a powder puff, brush or sponge, it comes in all shades to match skin.  
 *[[Lipstick]]. 
 *[[Eye make-up]]. 
 *Hand care: [[manicure]] and [[Nail art|nail polish]] 
 
 == History of cosmetics == 
 The word ''cosmetics'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κοσμητικός (''kosmētikos''),  " skilled in ordering or arranging " . < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkosmhtiko%2Fs κοσμητικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus < /ref >

 The makeup market originated and developed in the United States during the 1910s, thanks to the pioneering efforts of influential figures such as Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, and Max Factor. These visionary individuals played a crucial role in shaping the cosmetics industry. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Revlon entered the scene, followed by Estée Lauder in the post-war period, further solidifying the market's growth and diversity. 
 
 Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, Max Factor, Revlon, and Estée Lauder were instrumental in introducing innovative beauty products and revolutionizing the way makeup was perceived and used. Their contributions not only elevated the concept of makeup but also propelled it into the mainstream. 
 
 Often referred to as cosmetics, makeup encompasses a wide range of products designed to enhance or alter one's appearance. Examples include lipstick, mascara, foundation, eyeshadow, blush, and various other beauty items. These products are meticulously formulated and crafted to cater to diverse preferences, skin types, and tones. 
 
 The advent of these visionary makeup brands brought about a significant shift in societal attitudes towards beauty and self-expression. Their commitment to quality, innovation, and consumer satisfaction set the stage for the thriving cosmetics industry we see today. The influence of these pioneers continues to resonate, shaping trends, inspiring new brands, and driving continuous evolution within the makeup market. 
 
 With a rich history rooted in the early 20th century, the makeup market has evolved into a multi-billion-dollar industry, driven by a constant stream of new product launches, collaborations, and advancements in technology. Today, makeup has become an integral part of many individuals' daily routines, allowing them to express their unique personalities, enhance their features, and embrace their individuality. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Khan|first=Fizza|title=Best Makeup Artist In Dubai {{!}} Fizza Khan Makeup Artist|url=https://www.fizzakhan.com/|url-status=dead|access-date=2023-05-25|website=Makeup Artist In Dubai Fizza Khan|language=en-US|archive-date=2023-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530201756/https://www.fizzakhan.com/}} < /ref >
