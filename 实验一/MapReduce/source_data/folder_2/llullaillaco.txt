 '''Llullaillaco''' is a {{convert|6739|m|ft}} [[stratovolcano]] in the [[Andes]] [[Mountain range|range]], in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. < ref > {{cite peakbagger|pid=8545|name=Cerro Llullaillaco, Argentina/Chile|accessdate=22 November 2019}} < /ref >  It is the [[List of mountains in the Andes|7th highest mountain in the Andes]]. < ref name= " andes.org.uk " > {{cite web |url=http://www.andes.org.uk/andes-information-files/6000m-peaks.asp |title=Andes 6000 & nbsp;m peak list |publisher=Andes.org |language= |accessdate=26 July 2016 |date= }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite peakware |id=1197|name=Llullaillaco |accessdate=22 November 2019}} < /ref > 
 
 It lies in the [[Puna de Atacama]], a region of very high volcanic peaks on a high [[plateau]] within the [[Atacama Desert]], one of the [[:wikt:driest|driest]] places in the world. 
 
 == History == 
 The first recorded ascent was on 1 December 1952, by Bión González and Juan Harseim, from Chile. < ref name= " andes " > {{cite web |url=http://www.andeshandbook.org/montanismo/cerro/43/Llullaillaco |title=Volcán Llullaillaco |publisher=Andeshandbook.org |language=Spanish |accessdate=26 July 2016 |date= }} < /ref >  They found archaeological evidence that people were at the top of Llullaillaco in the [[pre-Columbian]] period. 
 
 During 1983–1985, American [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] Johan Reinhard directed three [[:wikt:survey|surveys]] of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[site]]s on the [[summit]] and [[:wikt:slope|slopes]]  of the mountain. 
 
 The [[summit]] is the highest [[archaeological site]] in the world. The [[mummies]] of three [[Inca]] children were found on it in 1999. < ref > {{cite summitpost |id=184475 |name=Llullaillaco |accessdate=22 November 2019}} < /ref >  These were found by Johan Reinhard and Constanza Ceruti and their expedition. < ref name= " livescience " > {{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/21097-extreme-volcano-microbes-found.html |title=Extreme microbes found near mummy burial site |publisher=Livescience |language= |accessdate=26 July 2016 |date= 21 June 2012}} < /ref >  Other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] were also found along with the mummies. It is believed that the children were part of a [[human sacrifice]]. < ref > {{cite news |last1=Wilford |first1=John Noble |title=Entirely Preserved Inca Mummies Found |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/07/us/entirely-preserved-inca-mummies-found.html |accessdate=22 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=7 April 1999}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite magazine |title=The  " Llullaillaco Maiden "  Was Sedated at Time of Death - Archaeology Magazine |magazine=Archaeology Magazine |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=30 July 2013 |url=https://www.archaeology.org/news/1136-130730-argentina-llullaillaco-maiden-coca-alcohol |accessdate=22 November 2019}} < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 The volcano is in the Chile-Argentina boder and is part, on the Chilean part, of the [[Llullaillaco National Park]] ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Llullaillaco}}). 
 
 The Llullaillaco is a [[stratovolcano]]. There were [[Volcanic eruption|eruptions]] in 1854, 1866 and 1877. Since then, no volcanic activity has been recorded. It is the world´s second highest active volcano, second to ''Ojos del Salado''. < ref name= " andes "  / > < ref > {{cite gvp|vn=355110 |name=Llullaillaco |accessdate=22 November 2019}} < /ref > 
 
 It is an [[ultra-prominent peak]], or '''Ultra''' for short, because it has as a [[summit]] with a [[topographic prominence]] of {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}} or more. < ref name= " PeakList " > {{cite web|url=http://www.peaklist.org/ultras.html|title=The Ultra-Prominences Page|publisher = Peaklist.org|last=Maizlish|first=A. |language= |accessdate=26 July 2016 |date= }} < /ref >
