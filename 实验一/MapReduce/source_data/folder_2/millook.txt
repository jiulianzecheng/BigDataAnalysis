 '''Millook''' is a place on the north coast of [[Cornwall]]. It has these remarkable cliffs. < ref name=OS190 > {{cite map|title=Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 190 ''Bude  &  Clovelly''|ISBN=978-0-319-23145-6|publisher=Ordnance Survey}} < /ref >  The cliffs at Millook  are so famous they were voted by the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]] as one of Britain's top 10 [[geological]] [[site]]s. They came top of the  " folding and [[fault]]ing "  category. < ref name=bbc-20141013 > {{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29572008 |title=Chart-topping rocks: UK's 'Greatest Geosites' announced |author=Jonathan Webb |publisher=BBC |date=13 October 2014 |access-date=13 October 2014}} < /ref >   
 
 The cliffs have a  series of [[horizontal]] [[chevron (geology)|chevron folds]]. The rocks were once [[sedimentary rocks]] laid down in deep water during the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods. We know this because they still contain [[brachiopod]] fossils of a type which lived in the late Devonian period. Later they were altered by heat from [[granite]] during mountain building in the English counties of [[Devon]] and Cornwall. < ref > Inter-bedded [[sandstone]]s and [[shale]]s were originally deposited in deep water: {{cite journal | title=Some considerations on the kinematics of chevron folds |author1=Bastida F. |author2=Aller J. |author3=Toimil N.C. |author4=Lisle R.J. |author5=Bobillo-Ares N.C. | journal=Journal of Structural Geology | year=2007 | volume=29 | issue=7 | pages=1185â€“1200 | doi=10.1016/j.jsg.2007.03.010|bibcode=2007JSG....29.1185B }} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Variscan orogeny]] caused the [[intrusion]] of the hot granite. The subsequent contact with the [[sandstone]]s created the [[metamorphic rocks]] seen today. This also put intense pressure on the sediments causing them to be folded and [[fault]]ed. What we see is a small part of a huge mountain system    caused by a continental collision between [[Euramerica]] ([[Laurussia]]) and [[Gondwana]]. This formed the supercontinent of [[Pangaea]].
