 '''Militarization''' is when [[society]] gets ready for [[war]] and [[violence]]. It is connected to [[militarism]], which is a belief that a [[country]] should have a strong military. The process of militarization affects many different parts of society and is complex. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|title=Militarization - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/militarization|access-date=2022-08-27|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref >

 The amount of danger that is thought to exist affects how much a country needs to be able to fight and protect itself. If a country does not feel like it is in danger, < ref name= " :0 "  / >  for example: Canada, it might not have as big of a military or as many weapons. But in Israel, because [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|there is a risk of attack]] from other countries nearby, the military and defense are important and get a lot of money and people. 
 This danger could come from:

 Militaristic ideas are used in non-military situations. For example, when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] talked about [[War on poverty|fighting poverty]], and President [[Richard Nixon]] talked about [[War on Drugs|fighting drugs]], they were not talking about real wars with an enemy that can be defeated. They were talking about how much work, effort, and dedication is needed to solve these problems. < ref name= " unherd-20221230 " > Matthew Crawford.  " [https://unherd.com/2022/12/covid-was-liberalisms-endgame-2/ Covid was liberalism's endgame] " , ''[[UnHerd]]'', 30 December 2022. < /ref >  Sometimes, politicians use militaristic ideas when they create teams of government workers to solve important political or social problems. These teams are often called  " task forces. "  Using militaristic ideas can also help politicians to have more power, because in war time, the leader of the country has [[Martial law|more power than usual]]. < ref name= " tg-20200306 " > [[Simon Jenkins]].

 Militarization of police means when [[Police officer|police officers]] use military equipment and [[Military tactics|tactics]]. This includes things like [[Armored vehicle|armored vehicles]], [[Assault rifle|assault rifles]], [[Sniper rifle|sniper rifles]], [[Hand grenade|grenades]], and [[SWAT team|SWAT teams]]. It is also connected to when police gather information on the public and [[Political activist|political activists]] in the same way as [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] and when police use more aggressive methods. A criminal justice professor named Peter Kraska defines the militarization of police as when the police start to act more like the military and follow their ways of doing things.
