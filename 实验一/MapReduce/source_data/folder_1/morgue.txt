 A '''morgue''' is a place where dead human bodies are kept for a short time soon after the person died. Sometimes, the body is examined by [[autopsy]]. Most often, the body is delivered to a [[Noredirect|mortuary]] and [[bury|buried]] in a [[grave]] or [[cremation|cremated]]. Morgues are found in [[hospital]]s, usually on the lowest floor or basement.
