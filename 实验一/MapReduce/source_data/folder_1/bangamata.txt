 In his patriotic song, known as ''Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy'' (1905), the poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote the following depiction of Bangladesh: < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |title=Lyric aaji bangladesher hridoy |website=geetabitan.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144200/http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |archive-date=2012-10-17}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/rs-a1/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy-english-translation.html | title=Song aji bangladesher hridoy  & #124; English translation }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news |title=What's in a word? |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/whats-word-1364398 |work=The Daily Star |type=Opinion}} < /ref > 
 :When did you come out of the heart of Bangladesh, 
 :O, Mother dear, with such inexplicable splendour! 
 :It’s impossible to take away eyes from you! 
 :The doors of your golden temple have unlocked. 
 :Your right hand holds the blazing sword, the left one takes away fear, 
 :Smile of affection on the eyes, the third eye glaring. 
 :O Mother dear, how uniquely you reveal yourself! 
 :The cloud of your untied hair conceals thunders 
 :Ends of your sunlight coloured robes flutter in the horizon! 
 :It’s impossible to take away eyes from you! 
 :The doors of your golden temple have unlocked. 
 :When impassionately did not look up seemed 
 :Poor mother stayed back home , desolate, destitute. 
 :Your torn clothes vanish now, meagre smile disappear. 
 :Beams of light scatter from your feet into entire sky 
 :O Mother, your appearance astounds me. 
 :You flood the world with the flow of happiness on the distressed nights 
 :O the mindblower, your word of fearlessness drum the heart 
 :It’s impossible to take away eyes from you! 
 :The doors of your golden temple have unlocked. 
 
 This is most probably only picturesque details of Mother [[Bengal]].
