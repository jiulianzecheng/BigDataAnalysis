 '''Freon''' is a word for certain [[chemical compound]] < nowiki/ > s, often used as [[Refrigerant|refrigerants]]. [[Thomas Midgley]], Jr. invented using Freon as a refrigerant.   " Freon "  is a [[trademark|registered trademark]] of [[DuPont]]. Freon was first used to describe [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) refrigerants, but it is now used to describe many other kinds of chemicals used as refrigerant. Refrigerants may contain [[carbon]], [[chlorine]], [[fluorine]] and sometimes [[bromine]]. For example, Freon 10 is [[carbon tetrachloride]]. Many kinds of freon are not toxic to animals.{{cn|date=February 2012}} They also are cheap and work well. However, most refrigerants can reduce the amount of [[ozone]] from the upper [[atmosphere]]. Reducing ozone lets more [[ultraviolet]] light to come through. Too much ultraviolet light can cause [[skin cancer]] and [[cataracts]], and can kill off [[plankton]] in the oceans.  
 
 The [[chlorine]] part of CFC refrigerants can reduce ozone. [[Hydrochlorofluorocarbon|Hydrochlorofluorocarbons]] (HCFCs) can also damage ozone. Newer Hydrofulorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants do not have chlorine in them and do not reduce ozone in the atmosphere. Most refrigerants also increase [[global warming]] because they are powerful greenhouse gasses. These refrigerants increase global warming thousands of times more than [[carbon dioxide]] (CO < sub > 2 < /sub > ).
