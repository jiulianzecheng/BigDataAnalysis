 '''Maine''' is the [[northeast]]-most [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]]. The [[capital (city)|capital]] is [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]], although the city of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], farther south, is the largest in the state. Maine became the 23rd state, on March 15, 1820. < ref > {{Citation| url = http://www.mainehistory.info/timeline.html| accessdate = 2010-03-15| title = Maine History Timeline| archive-date = 2010-05-29| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100529234910/http://www.mainehistory.info/timeline.html| url-status = dead}} < /ref >   It was previously a part of Massachusetts. Commercial Fishing, including [[lobster]] [[wikt:trap|trap]]ping, is a traditional and still vital part of the coastal economy. Tourism is a large industry in [[south]]ern Maine because of its many [[beach]]es and picturesque coastal villages. Southern Maine is the part of the state that has the most people. Many other areas, to the North, are far more rural. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 To the south and east is the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to the north and northeast is [[New Brunswick]], and the country of [[Canada]]. The Canadian province of [[Quebec]] is to the northwest. Maine is both the northernmost state in New England and the largest, [[wikt:accounting|accounting]] for nearly half the [[wikt:region|region's]] whole land area. Maine also has the [[wikt:distinction|distinction]] of being the only state to border just one other state (New Hampshire to the west). The [[wikt:municipalities|municipalities]] of [[Eastport]] and [[Lubec]] are the easternmost city and town in the United States. Estcourt Station is Maine's northernmost point and also the northernmost point in the New England region of the [[United States]]. 
 
 Maine's  " Moosehead Lake "  is the biggest lake that is completely in New England (Lake Champlain is located between [[Vermont]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], which is not considered part of New England). A number of other Maine lakes, like as [[South Twin Lake]], are said by Thoreau. [[Mount Katahdin]] is both the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, which {{broken wikt link|extends|extends}} to [[Springer Mountain]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the southern {{broken wikt link|terminus|terminus}} of the new  " International Appalachian Trail "  which, when finished, will run to  " Belle Isle " , Newfoundland and Labrador. 
 
 Maine is the only state that shares its borders with only one other [[American state]] since it only borders [[New Hampshire]] and [[Canada]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-u-s-state-borders-only-one-other-state.html|title=Which U.S. State Borders Only One Other State?|date=25 April 2017|publisher=World Atlas|accessdate=July 3, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Climate=== 
 Maine has a [[Humidity|humid]] {{broken wikt link|continental|continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with warm (although mostly not hot), humid [[summer]]s. [[Winter]]s are cold and snowy all over the state, and are mostly more severe in the northern parts of Maine. Coastal areas are [[wikt:moderated|moderated]] somewhat by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Daytime highs are mostly in the 75–80 & nbsp;°F (24–27 & nbsp;°C) range all over the state in July, with overnight lows in the high 50s°F (around 15 & nbsp;°C). [[January]] [[temperature]]s range from highs near 32 & nbsp;°F (0 & nbsp;°C) on the southern coast to overnight lows below 0 & nbsp;°F (−18 & nbsp;°C) in the far [[north]]. 
 
 Maine is mostly safe from [[hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s. By the time they reach the state, many have become {{broken wikt link|extratropical|extratropical}} and few hurricanes have made landfall in Maine. Maine has fewer days of [[thunderstorm]]s than any other state east of the Rockies, with most of the state with less than 20 days of thunderstorms a year. [[Tornado]]es are rare in Maine, about two per [[year]], mostly happening in the southern part of the state. 
 
 In January 2009, a new record low temperature for the state was set at −50 & nbsp;°F, tying the New England record. The state's record high temperature is 105 & nbsp;°F, set in July 1911.

 ==History== 
 
 Humans have lived in Maine for many thousands of years.  The [[Penobscot]], [[Mi’kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], [[Passamaquoddy]], and [[Penobscot]] [[Native American]] groups all lived there before Europeans found Maine. < ref name=Beacon > {{cite news|url=https://mainebeacon.com/indigenous-peoples-day-in-maine-is-empty-without-full-sovereignty-tribal-leaders-say/|publisher=Maine Beacon|accessdate=October 29, 2021|author=Dan Neumann|date=October 11, 2021|title=Indigenous Peoples' Day in Maine is 'empty' without full sovereignty, tribal leaders say}} < /ref > < ref name=Gov / > 
 
 Early during the colonial time, Maine was part of [[Massachusetts]].  It became its own state in 1820, the 23rd state in the United States of America.  Its northern border with Canada was set in 1842. < ref name=Gov > {{cite web|url=https://www.maine.gov/portal/about_me/history.html|title=About Maine: History|accessdate=October 29, 2021|publisher=About Maine}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Population== 
 [[File:Maine population map.png|180px|right|thumb|A population map of Maine.]] 
 As of 2008, Maine has an [[wikt:estimated|estimated]] population of 1,321,504, which is an [[wikt:increase|increase]] of 6,520, or 0.5%, from the past year and an increase of 46,582, or 3.7%, since the year of 2000. This has a natural increase since the last census of 6,413 people (that is 71,276 births minus 64,863 deaths) and an increase because of  " net migration "  of 41,808 people into the state. [[Immigration]] from outside the [[United States]] made a net increase of 5,004 people, and migration within the country made a net increase of 36,804 people. The population [[wikt:density|density]] of the state is 41.3 people per [[square mile]]. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 [[Image:Cape Neddick Light, 3.jpg|180px|right|thumb| < center > Cape Neddick Light < /center > ]] 
 The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] [[wikt:estimates|estimates]] that Maine's total gross state [[wikt:product|product]] for 2007 was $48 billion. Its per capita personal income for 2007 was $33,991, 34th in the [[United states|country]]. 
 
 People in Maine produce [[agriculture|agricultural]] goods like [[poultry]], [[egg (food)|egg]]s, [[dairy product]]s, [[cattle]], wild [[blueberries]] (the state makes 25% of all blueberries in North America, making it the largest blueberry maker in the world), [[apple]]s, [[maple syrup]] and [[maple sugar]]. Aroostook County is known for its [[potato]] crops. [[Commerce|Commercial]] [[fish]]ing, once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, mostly [[lobster]]ing and [[groundfishing]]. Western Maine {{broken wikt link|aquifers|aquifers}} and springs are a big source of bottled [[water]]. Maine's company outputs make [[paper]], [[lumber]] and wood products, [[electronics|electronic]] stuff, [[leather]] things, [[food]] [[wikt:products|products]], [[textiles]], and [[bio-technology]]. [[Naval shipbuilding]] and building remain key as well, with Bath Iron Works in Bath and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery. Naval Air Station [[Brunswick]] is also in Maine, and serves as a large support base for the [[U.S. Navy]]. However, the BRAC campaign recommended Brunswick's closing, [[wikt:despite|despite]] a new government-funded effort to upgrade its [[wikt:facilities|facilities]].
