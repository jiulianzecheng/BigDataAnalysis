 '''Renting''' (also called '''leasing''') is where someone pays [[money]] to use something for a definite amount of time. This can be anything from a [[car]] or [[house]] to a [[DVD]].  The document that has all the details written on it is called the ''lease''. The person who owns the item that will be leased or rented is called the ''lessor''. The person who is paying the money to use the item is called the ''lessee''. If it is a house, building, or land that is being leased, the person who pays the money is called the ''[[tenant]]''. For example, a tenant farmer is a person who rents a farm from its owner. [[Convict leasing]] was a historical practice of [[prison]]s in the [[United States]] and certain other countries offering convicted [[prisoner]]s as ultra-cheap labor to private entities as a form of [[penal servitude]]. 
 
 In a closed-end lease (like a car), it is best to drive a vehicle with a [[residual value]] of at least 55%. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Car Leasing Companies|url=https://www.car-leasing-companies.co.uk/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=www.car-leasing-companies.co.uk}} < /ref >
