'''Widescreen''' is a [[video]] [[format]] with a greater [[aspect ratio]] than 4:3.  Widescreens have long been used in some [[movies]].  In the early 21st century it also became very [[Popularity|popular]] for [[television]] and other things like [[Computer monitor]]s.  
 
 Widescreen is often used as a [[nickname]] for the 16:9 [[aspect ratio]] of television screens. This means that if the television screen was sixteen [[inch]]es [[wide]] it would have to be nine inches [[wikt:tall|tall]]. Most 20th century [[television]] screens were 4:3 which means if it was four inches wide it would have to be three inches tall.  A widescreen could be any size with the same ratio.  For example, a screen could be 32 feet wide and 18 feet tall and still be considered widescreen.
