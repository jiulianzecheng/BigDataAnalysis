In 1939, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved [[Thanksgiving]] one week earlier than normal. He thought this would help increase [[retail]] sales during one of the final years of the [[Great Depression]]. This led to much upheaval and protest. Those upset by the change called the holiday '''Franksgiving'''. Thanksgiving (after 1941) takes place on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/us/franksgiving-a-modern-take-on-a-post-depression-holiday.html|title=New York Times|access-date=November 22, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >
