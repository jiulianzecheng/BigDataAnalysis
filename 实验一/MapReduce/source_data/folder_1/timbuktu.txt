 '''Timbuktu''' is a [[city]] in [[Tombouctou Region]], [[Mali]]. [[Sankore University]] and other [[madrasa]]s are in the city. The city was important for thinking and for religion in the 15th and 16th centuries.  It was important in spreading [[Islam]] through [[Africa]] at that time. There are three great [[mosque]]s: [[Djinguereber Mosque|Djingareyber]], [[Sankore]] and [[Sidi Yahya]]. They are reminders of Timbuktu's golden age. They are always being fixed, but are threatened because the [[desert]] is spreading. < ref > [http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31 & id_site=119 Timbuktu — World Heritage (Unesco.org)] < /ref > 
 
 [[Songhay]], [[Tuareg]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], and [[Mandé]] people live in Timbuktu. It is about 15 [[km]] [[north]] of the [[Niger River]]. There is a route across the [[Sahara Desert]] from [[east]] to [[west]] and this is used for [[trade]]. There is another from [[north]] to [[south]]. These two routes meet in Timbuktu. It is an ''[[entrepôt]]'' for [[rock salt]] from [[Taoudenni]]. This means that the [[rock salt|salt]] is brought here and sold to other people to take it somewhere else, but no [[tax]] is charged. 
 
 Its location helped different people meet, so local people, [[Berber people|Berber]]s and [[Arab]]s met here. It has a long history of mixed [[Africa]]n [[trade]], so it became famous in [[Europe]] for this reason. Therefore, western people often thought of Timbuktu as being exotic. It has a hot [[desert climate]] (''BWh'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). 
 
 Timbuktu has given a lot of research and study to [[Islam]] and to the [[world]]. < ref > Timbuktu. (2007). Encyclopædia Britannica. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica. < /ref >  Important books were written and copied in Timbuktu in the 14th century. This made the city become the center of writing in [[Africa]]. < ref > Okolo Rashid. Legacy of Timbuktu:
