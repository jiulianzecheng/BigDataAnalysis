'''Wadjet''' is a [[goddess]] in [[Egyptian mythology]]. She was often shown in [[art]] as a [[cobra]] and was the protector of lower [[Egypt]]. Later, she became the protector of [[king]]s. Her worship was already established by the Predynastic Period, but did change somewhat as time progressed. She began as the local goddess of Per-Wadjet (Buto) but soon became a patron goddess of Lower Egypt.
