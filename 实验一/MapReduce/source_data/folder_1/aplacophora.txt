 The '''Aplacophora''' is a [[Class (biology)|class]] of small, deep-water, exclusively [[benthic]], shell-less [[Ocean|marine]] [[mollusc]]s. They are found in all oceans of the world. They are a small group of molluscs which have deviated from the normal molluscan form. There are approximately 320 < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Aplacophora|url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/inverts/mollusca/aplacophora.php|access-date=2023-05-23|website=ucmp.berkeley.edu}} < /ref >  known species living today. They are rather [[worm]]-like and average about an inch (2.5 cms.) in length. 
 
 == Description == 
 Most live in deep water, except a few more northern species.  One group bury themselves into the [[sand]] and [[mud]] of the ocean bottom where they feed on [[annelid]]s and other small invertebrates. The rest of the known aplacophorans parasitize [[hydroid]]s and other [[coral]]s. < ref > Barnes, Robert D. 1982. ''Invertebrate Zoology''.

 This class used to be classified as [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s in the [[echinoderm]]s. In 1987, they were officially recognized as [[mollusc]]s and given their own class. The class is [[polyphyletic]], and consists of two [[clade]]s. < ref > Giribet; Okusu A; Lindgren A.R.; Huff S.W.; Schrödl M; Nishiguchi M.K. 2006.
