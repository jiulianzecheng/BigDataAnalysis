 In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], a '''nucleon''' refers to any [[subatomic particle]] found in the [[nucleus]] of an [[atom]]. For instance, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s are nucleons, since they are in the nucleus of the atom. Nucleons are made of [[quark]]s.  
 
 == Nucleons and their properties == 
 === Types of nucleons === 
 {{main|Proton|Neutron}} 
 The main types of nucleons are protons and neutrons. A proton has a positive [[electric charge]], and a neutron has a neutral [[electric charge]] (meaning that it has no charge). The two in the nucleus of the atom make a positive charge, since the neutron has no charge at all.  
 
 [[Electron]]s are not nucleons, because they are not in the nucleus of the atom.  
 
 The other types of nucleons are ''antinucleons''. These are the [[antiparticles]] of the nucleons. 
 
 === The strong force and nucleons === 
 The [[fundamental force]] responsible for holding the nucleons together in the nucleus is called the [[strong force]].
