 '''WebCite''' is a service that [[wikt:archive|archives]] [[web page]]s. A user asks WebCite to archive a certain [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and then WebCite will make a copy of what the page looks like at that time. [[Author]]s use this when writing [[cite|citations]]. If the webpage changes or is removed ( " [[link rot]] " ), there is still a copy on WebCite. This is very important when writing papers for [[academic]] journals or for school. Using the WebCite service is free (it costs no money.) 
 
 WebCite saves many kinds of internet content. Some of these are: 
 * [[HTML]] web pages 
 * [[PDF]] files 
 * [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] 
 * [[JavaScript]] 
 * [[digital images]] (pictures) 
 
 It also saves some [[information]] ( " [[metadata]] " ) about the original content. This information includes the time it was saved, the [[MIME type]], and how long it is. This information is useful because it can prove that the archive version is [[Authentication|authentic]].
