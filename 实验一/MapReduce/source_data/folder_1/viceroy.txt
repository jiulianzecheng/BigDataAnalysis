A '''viceroy''' is a royal official who rules an area in the name of the King (or Queen). The word is made of 'vice' (Latin for 'in place of') and 'roy' (French, meaning 'king').

 The title was used when an empire has widespread territories which the [[monarch]] would rarely visit. It was used regularly by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Habsburg]] and [[British Empire|British]] [[empires]]. In the British Empire a viceroy was only appointed in the case of [[British India]], and only then for [[Lord Canning]] in 1858. Otherwise it was just a ceremonial name for the [[Govenor General|Governors-General]].
