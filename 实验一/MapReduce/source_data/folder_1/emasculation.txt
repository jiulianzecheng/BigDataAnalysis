Emasculation is also used [[metaphor]]ically to refer to the loss of a man's [[masculinity]]. A man is said to be emasculated when he loses, or is deprived of, a characteristic traditionally associated with being a man, such as power or independence. It is the removal of both the [[penis]] and the [[testicle]]s, the external [[Human male genitalia|male sex organ]]s. It differs from [[castration]], which is the removal of the testicles only. Throughout the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent tradition]], including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, some members of the [[Hijra (Indian subcontinent)|Hijra]] community reportedly undergo emasculation, or ''nirvan.''{{Sfnm|1a1=Bellringer|1y=2017a|1p=249|2a1=Stief|2y=2017|2p=74}} For the Hijra, emasculation does affect a recipient's gender identity, with some identifying as female, non-binary, or a third gender.{{Sfnm|1a1=Hossain|1y=2012|1p=495|2a1=Khan|2a2=Hussain|2a3=Parveen|2a4=Bhuiyan|2a5=Gourah|2a6=Sarker|2a7=Arafat|2a8=Sidker|2y=2009|2p=442|3a1=Nanda|3y=1999|3p=28|4a1=Stief|4y=2016|4p=73}}
