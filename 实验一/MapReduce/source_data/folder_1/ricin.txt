'''Ricin''' is a poison. It is a highly [[toxic]], naturally occurring [[protein]]. It is produced in the seeds of the [[castor oil plant]] ''Ricinus communis''.  
 
 A dose the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/What-Makes-Ricin-So-Deadly-203512561.html|title=What makes ricin so deadly|publisher=Anthony Sabella|date=|accessdate=2013-04-24|archive-date=2013-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430234212/http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/What-Makes-Ricin-So-Deadly-203512561.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The [[median lethal dose]] (LD < sub > 50 < /sub > ) of ricin is around 22 micrograms per kilogram (1.78 & nbsp;mg for an average adult, around {{frac|1|228}} of a standard aspirin tablet/0.4 & nbsp;g gross) in humans if [[injection|injected ]] or [[inhalation|inhaled]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1211902083375.htm |title=EFSA Scientific Opinion: Ricin (from Ricinus communis) as undesirable substances in animal feed [1 & #93; - Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain |publisher=Efsa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Oral exposure to ricin is far less toxic and a lethal dose can be up to 30â€“40 & nbsp;milligrams per kilogram. 
 
 Ricin prevents [[cells]] from assembling various [[amino acids]] into [[proteins]], and death occurs after a few hours up to a day. Ricin has been used as a [[terrorist]] weapon, including the [[assassination]] of [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978, supposedly by the [[KGB]].
