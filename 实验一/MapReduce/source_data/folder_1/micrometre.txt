A '''micrometre''' (the [[United States|American]] spelling is '''micrometer'''; symbol is '''Âµm''') is a [[unit of length]] in the [[SI]] measurement system. It can also be called a '''[[micron]]'''. It is one millionth of a [[metre]]. A micrometre is often used as a measurement for small things like bacteria. Like the [[Angstrom]] it is used for radiation in or near the [[visible spectrum]].
