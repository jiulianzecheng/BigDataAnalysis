 The '''Avocets''' are water birds which poke around in [[mud]] to get their food. They are a kind of bird which are often called  " waders " . 
 
 The genus name ''Recurvirostra'' comes from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|recurvus}}, 'curved backwards' and {{lang|la|rostrum}}, 'bill'. < ref name= " job " > {{cite book |last=Jobling |first=James A |year=2010 |title=The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names |url=https://archive.org/details/helmdictionarysc00jobl |publisher=Christopher Helm |location=London |isbn=978-1-4081-2501-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/helmdictionarysc00jobl/page/n266 266] }} < /ref >   
 
 Avocets sweep their long, thin, upcurved bills from side to side when feeding in the [[brackish]] or [[Saline water|saline]] [[Wetland|wetlands]] they prefer. Their plumage is pied (usually black and white), sometimes also with some red. 
 
 Avocets have webbed feet and swim. Their diet consists of aquatic insects and other small creatures. Their favourite places are [[mud]]flats and [[estuaries]]. They walk around on the mud, sticking their bill into it and sweeping from side to side to find small prey. 
 
 Avocets have made a return to [[Britain]]. During [[WWII]] some land was allowed to return to its previous [[salt marsh]] condition. This was followed by the later development of [[nature reserve]]s. Avocets now use the [[Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve]] as a summer breeding ground. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.hants.gov.uk/thingstodo/countryparks/titchfield/explore/cottagehide |title=Cottage Hide |publisher=Hampshire County Council |language=en-GB |access-date=3 June 2019 |archive-date=3 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603163203/https://www.hants.gov.uk/thingstodo/countryparks/titchfield/explore/cottagehide |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
