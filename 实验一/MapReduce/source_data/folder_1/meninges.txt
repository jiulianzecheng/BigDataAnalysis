 The '''meninges''' are the [[membrane]]s that surround and protect the [[brain]] and the [[spinal cord]].  In [[mammal]]s, the meninges have three layers: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. < ref name=tb > {{cite book |last1=Mistovich |first1=Joseph J. | last2=Karren |first2=Keith J. |last3=Hafen |first3=Brent |date=July 18, 2013 |title=Prehospital Emergency Care |edition=10th |url= |location= |publisher=Prentice Hall |page= |isbn=978-0133369137}} < /ref > 
 
 In the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater (called the  " subarachnoid space " ), there is [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).  CSF is a special [[fluid]] which bathes the brain and spinal cord.  The meninges and the CSF work together to [[cushion]] and protect the [[central nervous system]] (the brain and spinal cord). < ref name=tb/ > 
 
 ==Layers of the meninges== 
 ===Pia mater=== 
 The pia mater (or  " pia " ) is the layer of the meninges that is closest to the brain and spinal cord.  It is a thin, [[wikt:delicate|delicate]] layer ( " pia mater "  means  " [[wikt:tender|tender]] mother "  in [[Latin]]).  The pia mater sticks very closely to both the brain and spinal cord. < ref name=piaspine > {{cite book |last1=Maches |first1=Fabiola | last2=Reina |first2=Miguel Angel |last3=de Leon Casasola |first3=Oscar |date=November 13, 2014 |title=  " Ultrastructure of Spinal Pia Mater.

 The smallest type of [[blood vessel]]s, called [[capillaries]], go through the pia mater and bring the brain the things it needs, like [[blood]] and [[oxygen]]. The pia's capillaries also make up an important part of the [[blood-brain barrier]]. < ref name=pia/ >   This is the brain's  " security system. "   It controls what can leave the [[bloodstream]] and get into the brain's [[neuron|nerve cells]], and what cannot. < ref name=bbb > {{cite web |url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Blood-brain_barrier |title=Blood-brain barrier |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=February 24, 2009 |website= |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |accessdate=February 2, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 The pia's capillaries are lined with cells that are packed very closely together. < ref name=pia/ >   Only certain things can get through these cells and reach the brain.  This helps block things like [[bacteria]] and some [[poison]]s from getting into the brain.  It also lets in the things that the brain needs to survive, like [[glucose]] (sugar), water, and [[white blood cell]]s (which fight [[infection]]). < ref name=bbb/ > 
 
 ===Arachnoid mater=== 
 [[File:Spinal_dura_mater_1.jpg|thumb|{{Center|On [[autopsy]], the protective dura have been cut from the spine, and the clear arachnoid layer can be seen covering and protecting the spinal cord}}]] 
 The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges.  It is a thin, clear membrane that fits loosely over the pia mater.  This leaves a space in between these two layers called the  " subarachnoid space. "   ( " Subarachnoid space "  means  " the space under the arachnoid. " ) < ref name=tb/ >   Cerebrospinal fluid flows through the subarachnoid space. < ref name=arach > {{cite journal |author=Adeeb N, Deep A| display-authors = etal|title=The intracranial arachnoid mater: A comprehensive review of its history, anatomy, imaging, and pathology |url= |journal=Child's Nervous System | year = 2013|publisher=Springer-Verlag |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=17–33 |doi=10.1007/s00381-012-1910-x | pmid = 22961357| s2cid = 13822999}} < /ref > 
 
 One of the arachnoid layer's most important jobs is to cushion the brain.  Like the pia mater, the arachnoid mater is made of cells that fluid cannot get through.  Because fluid cannot get through either of these layers, the cerebrospinal fluid stays in the subarachnoid space and does not leak out.  Having this layer of fluid helps protect the brain, like a car's [[airbag]].  Without this cushion, every time a person moved their head, their brain would hit the inside of the [[skull]] and would get hurt. < ref name=arach/ > 
 
 The arachnoid mater also has an important job in the blood-brain barrier.  Blood runs through the dura mater, the last layer of the meninges.  The arachnoid mater keeps blood from getting through into the cerebrospinal fluid.  This is important, because if blood gets through the arachnoid mater into the cerebrospinal fluid, the brain and spinal cord can get irritated and [[infection|infected]].  Like all parts of the body, the arachnoid mater needs blood and oxygen to survive.  Small blood vessels bring these things to the arachnoid layer.  However, the arachnoid layer prevents the blood from getting through to the cerebrospinal fluid. < ref name=arach/ > 
 
 The arachnoid mater is attached to the last layer of the meninges: the dura mater. < ref name=tb/ > 
 
 ===Dura mater=== 
 [[Image:Slide7Neo.JPG|thumb|left|{{Center|On [[autopsy]], the protective dura mater has been peeled back}}]] 
 The dura mater (or  " dura " ) is the layer of the meninges that is farthest from the brain and the spinal cord.  It is a thick, protective layer.  ( " Dura mater "  means  " tough mother "  in Latin.)  The dura protects the brain from being scraped and hurt by the skull, which is very rough. < ref name=dura > {{cite book |last1=Woldenberg |first1=R.A. | last2=Kohn |first2=S.A. |date=2014 |title= " Dura Mater. "  In Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences |edition=2nd |url= |location= |publisher=Elsevier |page=1039-1042 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385157-4.01143-X}} < /ref > 
 
 The dura mater has the largest blood vessels of all three layers of the meninges.  The [[vein]]s in the dura carry blood from the brain to the [[heart]] after the brain has used up the oxygen in the blood.  The [[artery|arteries]] in the dura carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart.  These arteries split into the capillaries in the pia mater. < ref name=dura/ > 
 
 The dura also folds into the brain in four different places to separate parts of the brain, including the two [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. < ref name=dura/ > 
 
 ===Mnemonic=== 
 Some medical professionals use a [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] to remember the layers in the meninges and what order they go in.  The mnemonic is:  " The meninges '''PAD''' the brain " : < ref name=tb/ > 
 * '''P'''ia mater: closest to the brain and spinal cord 
 * '''A'''rachnoid mater: middle layer 
 * '''D'''ura mater: farthest from the brain and spinal cord 
 
 ==Problems with the meninges== 
 Because the meninges do many important things for the central nervous system, problems with the meninges can be very dangerous.  The most common problems with the meninges are caused by infections or bleeding in the meninges. 
 
 ===Bleeding problems=== 
 When blood vessels in the meninges break or are [[injury|injured]], those blood vessels will cause bleeding in the meninges.  Bleeding in the meninges is a type of [[stroke]] called a [[hemorrhagic stroke]].  ( " Hemorrhagic "  means  " caused by dangerous bleeding (hemorrhage) " ).  Bleeding in the meninges is very dangerous, because if enough blood builds up, the blood can squeeze or crush the brain. 
 
 ===Infections=== 
 The blood-brain barrier in the meninges' blood vessels protects the brain from most [[pathogens]] (things that cause infection).  Because of this, infections in the brain are not very common.  This is important, because [[antibody|antibodies]] - which the body's [[immune system]] makes to fight off infections - cannot get past the blood-brain barrier into the brain.  Neither can most [[antibiotic]] [[medication]]s. < ref name=Raza > {{Cite journal|pmid= 15808097|year= 2005|last1= Raza M.W. |display-authors = etal|title= Penetration and activity of antibiotics in brain abscess|volume= 15|issue= 3|pages= 165–7|journal= Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP}} < /ref >   This means that when a person does get a brain infection, the body usually cannot fight off the infection on its own, and most of the medications that [[medical doctor|doctors]] use to kill infections cannot get into the brain to kill the pathogens inside. 
 
 However, some [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], and other [[germ]]s are able to get through the blood-brain barrier and cause infections.  Examples of these infections include: < ref > {{cite journal |author=Lozano R, Naghavi M| display-authors = etal|date=2013 |title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 |url= |journal=The Lancet |volume=380 |issue=9859 |pages=2095–2128 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 | pmid = 23245604| hdl = 10292/13775| s2cid = 1541253}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=van den Pol, AN 2009 |title=Viral infection leading to brain dysfunction: More prevalent than appreciated? |journal=Neuron |year=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.09.023 |pmid=19840542 |pmc=2782954 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Derber CJ; Troy SB 2012 |title=Head and Neck Emergencies: Bacterial Meningitis, Encephalitis, Brain Abscess, Upper Airway Obstruction, and Jugular Septic Thrombophlebitis |url= |journal=Interventions in Infectious Disease Emergencies |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier |volume=96 |issue=6 |pages=1107–1126 |doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2012.08.002 |pmid=23102480 }} < /ref >
