 '''Justice''' is a [[concept]] on [[ethics]] and [[law]] that means that people behave in a way that is fair, [[wikt:equal|equal]] and balanced for everyone. 
 
 ==In law== 
 [[Government]]s, and especially the [[police]] and [[court]]s, see that the [[law]]s are [[wikt:obey|obeyed]] in most [[society|societies]].  Because they can [[wikt:punish|punish]] a person for not obeying the law, most people agree that laws should be fair and the same for everyone.  But governments sometimes  make laws that many people believe are not [[wikt:just#Adjective|just]].  If many people believe this, people may lose respect for the law and may even disobey it.  However, in [[democracy|democratic]] societies, the law itself has ways to change or get rid of these unjust laws.
