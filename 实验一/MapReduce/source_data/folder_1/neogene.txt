The '''Neogene''' is the second [[geology|geological]] [[Period (geology)|period]] of the [[Cainozoic]]. It began 23 [[million]] years ago, and ended about 2.6 million years ago. Before the Neogene was the [[Palaeogene]]. The Neogene and the preceding [[Palaeogene]] were originally together considered one period, the [[Tertiary]]. 
 
 The Neogene has two stages: [[Miocene]], and [[Pliocene]]. It is followed by the [[Quaternary]]. Some geologists think that the Neogene cannot be clearly distinguished from the modern geological period, the [[Quaternary]]. < ref > Tucker M.E. 2001.

 The global climate became seasonal and with an overall drying and cooling trend. The ice caps on both poles began to grow and thicken. By the end of the period the first glaciation of the [[Quaternary|current Ice Age]] began. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Benn |first1=Douglas I. |title=Glaciers  &  glaciation |url=https://archive.org/details/glaciersglaciati0000benn_d0t8 |date=2010 |publisher=Hodder Education |location=London |isbn=9780340905791 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/glaciersglaciati0000benn_d0t8/page/15 15]â€“21 |edition=2nd}} < /ref > 
 
 Marine and continental [[flora]] and [[fauna]] have a modern appearance. [[Mammal]]s and [[bird]]s adapted to various habitats. The first humans (belonging to the species ''[[Homo habilis]]'') appeared in Africa near the end of the period. < ref > Lourens L; Hilgen F; Shackleton N.J; Laskar J.  &  Wilson D. 2004.
