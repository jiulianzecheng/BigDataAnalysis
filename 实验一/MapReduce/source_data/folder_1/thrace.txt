 '''Thrace'''  < ref > {{lang-el|Θράκη, Thráki}}; {{lang-tr|Trakya}} < /ref >  ({{lang-grc|Θρᾴκη}}: ''Thráke''; {{lang-bg|Тракия}}; ''Trakiya'', {{lang-tr|Trakya}}) is a historical and geographic area in Southeastern [[Europe]]. It was bounded by the [[Balkan Mountains]] on the north, the Rhodope Mountains and the [[Aegean Sea]] on the south, and by the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] on the east. Thrace included areas that are now southeastern [[Bulgaria]], northeastern [[Greece]], and the European part of [[Turkey]]. 
 
 The [[Thracians]] were an ancient [[Indo-European]] people. They lived in [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Eastern Europe|Western]], and [[Southeastern Europe]]. 
 
 == Ancient history == 
 The [[indigenous]] population of Thrace was a people called the [[Thracians]]. They were divided into many tribal groups. Thracian troops were known to be used in the Persian army. Many of them went with neighbouring ruler [[Alexander the Great]] when he crossed the [[Hellespont]] (which is next to Thrace) during his invasion of the [[Persian Empire]]. 
 
 The Thracians were divided into separate tribes. They did not form a lasting political organization until the [[Odrysian|Odrysian state]] was founded in the 4th century BC. Like [[Illyria]]ns, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition. The tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity. 
 
 Thrace was conquered by Alexander. It later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 46 AD, in the reign of [[Claudius]]. They became a [[province]], and later four provinces, of the [[Roman Empire]]. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of conflict and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence. 
 
 The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and ''Thrace'' and ''Thracians'' are simply the names  given them by the Greeks. < ref > John Boardman, I.E.S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N.G.L. Hammond. 1992. ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', vol 3, part 2: ''The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and other states of the Near East, from the eighth to the sixth centuries BC''. {{ISBN|0-521-22717-8}} page 597:  " We have no way of knowing what the Thracians called themselves and if indeed they had a common name...Thus the name of Thracians and that of their country were given by the Greeks to a group of tribes occupying the territory...
