 '''Barebacking''' is when people have [[sexual intercourse]] without using a [[condom]]. The term originated in the [[gay]] community, and was used to refer to unprotected [[anal sex]]. The word is related to ''bareback'', which means riding a [[horse]] without a [[saddle]]. Barebacking refers to a deliberate decision to not use a condom, forgetting to use a condom is not barebacking. 
 
 Barebacking is dangerous, because there is a high risk of [[infection]] with [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted diseases]], such as [[Syphilis]], or [[HIV]]. Even if both partners are HIV positive, there is a risk of [[infection]] with other [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of HIV.
