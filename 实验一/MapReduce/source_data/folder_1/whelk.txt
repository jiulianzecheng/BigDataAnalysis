 '''Whelk''' is a word used for some [[Ocean|marine]] [[gastropod]]s. They are found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] waters, and are used by humans as food. The name is properly used for the family '''Buccinidae''', sometimes called the  " true whelks " . 
 
 == Use of the term == 
 Whelk is a common name, and used for gastropods of various families.  
 * In the [[British Isles]] and the [[Netherlands]], where the word ''whelk'' probably originated, the word  " whelk "  is used for some [[species]] in the family Buccinidae.  ''Buccinum undatum'', from [[Europe]]an and the North [[Atlantic]], is the typical species. 
 
 * In [[North America]] ''whelk'' refers to several large edible species in the genera ''Busycon'' and ''Busycotypus'' in the family Melongenidae. These are sometimes called ''Busycon whelks''. In the [[United States]], the invasive Murex ''Rapana venosa'' is referred to as the ''Veined rapa whelk'' or ''Asian rapa whelk''. 
 
 * In the English-speaking islands of the [[West Indies]], the word ''whelks'' or ''wilks''  is both singular and plural. It is used for a large edible top shell, ''Cittarium pica'', also known as the ''magpie'' or ''West Indian top shell''. 
 
 * In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], species of the genus ''Cabestana'' are called ''predatory whelks''. 
 
 == Life of a whelk == 
 True whelks are [[carnivore]]s and [[scavenger]]s. < ref > Family Buccinidae. [http://seashellsofnsw.org.au/Buccininae/Pages/Buccinidae_intro.htm] < /ref >  They feed on [[clam]]s, [[carrion]], and sometimes even on [[detritus]]. Their sense of [[smell]] is very well-developed; they can sense chemical signals from their prey from a considerable distance. Many whelks can bore through the shell of [[bivalves]]. Because of this, they can cause harm in [[oyster]] farms. Whelks can even attack fish caught in a net by extending their [[proboscis|probosces]] to  twice the length of their own bodies.
