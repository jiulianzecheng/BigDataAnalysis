 '''Mashhad''' ({{lang-fa|مشهد}}) is a city in the [[Razavi Khorasan Province]] in [[Iran]]. Mashhad is the second largest city in Iran. It is close to Iran's border with [[Afghanistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. 
 
 Mashhad is primarily known as the resting place of [[Ali ar-Ridha|Imam Reza]] and also the great Persian poet, [[Ferdowsi]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Before the 9th century, Mashhad was a small village but became prosperous after imam Reza was killed and buried there by [[Al-Ma'mun]] the Abbasid caliph. Mashhad turned into a famous town, in the time of [[Shah Ismail I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty]]  (1501) and later [[Nader Shah]] of [[Afsharid Dynasty|his Empire]] chose Mashhad as his capital. Mashhad has remained one of Iran's most important cities to this day even with the relocation of the capital to [[Tehran]].
