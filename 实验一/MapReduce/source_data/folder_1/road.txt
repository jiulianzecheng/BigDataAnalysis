 [[File:Indiana-rural-road-dirt.jpg|thumb|right|A road made of [[gravel]]]] A '''road''' is a piece of land which connects two or more places. Usually, a road has been made easy to [[travel]] on, for example by removing [[tree]]s and [[stone]]s so the ground is more [[level]]. Although many roads are made of [[gravel]] and [[Soil|dirt]], some are paved with [[concrete]] or [[brick]] < nowiki/ > s or [[stone]] < nowiki/ > s. 
 
 People have been making roads for a long time. [[Roman roads in Britain]] and the [[Inca road system]] are famous. [[Transport]] by boats on [[waterway]] < nowiki/ > s was usually easier and faster than transport by road. In the [[industrial revolution]], the [[railway]] was invented. A railway is a special type of road, using [[railway track]]s. Roads are now usually made for [[wheel]]ed vehicles, like [[car]]s, to travel on. 
 
 
 
 When [[traffic congestion]] becomes a frequent problem, the road may be made wider or other roads built. 
 
 Road building and care is usually paid for by [[tax]]es.  Some roads are [[toll road]]s, where people pay to use the road.
