 '''HelenOS''' is an [[operating system]]. It is made by staff and students of the [[Mathematical and Physical Faculty]] of [[Charles University in Prague]]. It is running on some architectures. 
 
 == Technical overview == 
 HelenOS is a [[microkernel]] operating system, which supports [[multitasking]], [[memory management]], [[inter-process communication]] and [[symmetric multiprocessing]]. [[File system]], [[device driver]]s and other services are implemented like user processes. It can run on some architectures like [[IA-32]], [[x86-64]], [[SPARC V9]], [[IA-64]], [[Power PC]], [[ARM]] and [[MIPS]]. 
 
 License of the [[source code]] is [[BSD license]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Jakub Jermář made HelenOS as a student project at the University. A few years later worked on the HelenOS [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] group of students and some students are using it for self-education of programming until now. In 2011 the project HelenOS took part on [[Google Summer of Code]]. < ref > [http://www.root.cz/clanky/helenos-nikdy-nebude-dokonceny-rika-jeho-autor-jakub-jermar/ Interview with Jakub Jermář on root.cz] < /ref >
