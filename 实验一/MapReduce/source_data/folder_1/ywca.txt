The '''Young Women's Christian Association''' (YWCA) is the world's largest [[Woman|women]]'s [[organization]].{{cn}} 
 
 It is represented in more than 120 countries around the world with more than 25 million women and girls as members. The motto of the YWCA is the empowerment of women, worldwide. 
 
 In [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]], only the abbreviation YWCA is used. The full name is not used because [[Christianity]] no longer plays a role in the organization. 
 
 The YWCA in the [[United States]] is a member of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence for stricter gun control. 
 
 In [[Switzerland]], the YWCA was widespread as the Christian Association of Young Women (CVJF) until it merged with the [[CVJM]] to form [[Cevi]] Switzerland.
