London: Christopher Helm. {{ISBN|0-7136-8026-1}} < /ref >   Harriers usually hunt by flying low over open ground, feeding on small mammals, reptiles, or birds.

 == Details == 
 Most harriers are placed in the [[genus]] ''Circus''. This scientific name comes from the circling movements the birds make when courting. 
 
 Two other harriers are in the genus ''Polyboroides'', the ''harrier-hawks'', which are [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] (geographically separated) and restricted to the [[Afrotropic ecozone]].  The remaining single species forms the  [[genus]] ''[[Geranospiza]]''. 
 
 ===Ring-tails=== 
 ''Ring-tail'' is an informal term used by [[birder]]s for the juveniles and females of several harrier species. If seen in the field the exact species usually cannot be known.  Ring-tail harriers include the juveniles and females of [[Montagu's harrier]] (''Circus pygargus''); Northern or [[hen harrier]] (''Circus cyaneus''); and [[pallid harrier]] (''Circus macrourus'').
