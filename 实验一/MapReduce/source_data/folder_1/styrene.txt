 '''Styrene''' is a certain [[Organic compound|organic]] [[chemical compound]] having the [[chemical formula]] C < sub > 8 < /sub > H < sub > 8 < /sub > . Its [[chemical structure]] is made up of a [[vinyl group]] [[Chemical bond|bonded]] onto a [[benzene]] ring. This benzene ring makes styrene an [[aromatic]] compound. At room [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], styrene is a clear, colorless [[liquid]]. Other names for styrene can be ''styrol'', ''vinylbenzene'', ''phenylethene'', or ''phenylethylene''.  
 
 == Uses == 
 
 Styrene is used in [[polymer chemistry]] as a [[monomer]].  This means many styrene [[molecule]]s can bond together to make a larger molecule called [[polystyrene]]. Polystyrene is a kind of [[polymer]] often used as a [[plastic]]. This kind of [[chemical reaction]] is called [[polymerization]].  
 
 Styrene can also bond with other kinds of monomers to make other kinds of polymers called ''copolymers''. For one example, styrene has been mixed with another monomer called [[1,3-butadiene]] to make a copolymer which is a kind of [[synthetic rubber]]. For another example, styrene is mixed with [[acrylonitrile]] and [[1,3-butadiene]] to make a copolymer plastic called [[ABS]] ('''A'''crylonitrile-'''B'''utadiene-'''S'''tyrene). 
 
 == Production == 
 In industry, styrene is made from [[ethylbenzene]] by this [[chemical reaction]]:

 This kind of reaction is called [[dehydrogenation]]. [[Hydrogen]] is also made by this reaction..
