 The '''Agly River''' ({{lang-ca|Aglí}}, {{lang-oc|Aglin}}) is a [[river]] in southern [[France]]. It flows mostly to the southeast through the [[Plain]] of Roussillon, in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Occitanie]]. It ends in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. 
 
 On its way to the Mediterranean Sea, it flows through the [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Aude]] and [[Pyrénées-Orientales]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 The Agly river is {{Convert|81.7|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} long. < ref name= " sandre " > {{cite web |url=http://services.sandre.eaufrance.fr/Courdo/Fiche/client/fiche_courdo.php?CdSandre=Y06-0400 |title=Fiche cours d'eau - L'Agly (Y06-0400) |publisher=SANDRE - Portail national d'accès aux référentiels sur l'eau |language=fr |access-date=11 July 2013 |date=1 January 2006 }} < /ref >  Its [[Source (river or stream)|source]] is on the [[Mountain pass|Pass]] of Linas, to the northeast of the [[Pic de Bugarach|Pech de Bugarach]], the highest of the [[Corbières (mountains)|Corbières]] [[mountain]]s, [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Aude]], at an [[elevation]] of {{Convert|940|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}. 
 
 It then goes into the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] by the [[Canyon|gorges]] of Galamus and flows into the Mediterranean Sea south of Barcarès. 
 
 There is a [[dam]] on the Agly river, on Caramany, Pyrénées-Orientales; it was built to prevent [[flood]]s and to store water.

 ==Hydrology== 
 The Agly is a very irregular small river. Its flow was observed over a period of 42 years (1967-2008) in Estagel about twenty kilometers from its mouth and after receiving the waters of its [[tributary]] Verdouble. < ref name= " hydro2 " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.hydro.eaufrance.fr/selection.php |title=hydro.eaufrance.fr (Station: ''Y0664040'', Option: ''Synthèse'') |access-date=2013-07-20 |archive-date=2015-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219053605/http://www.hydro.eaufrance.fr/selection.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] of the river at this location is {{convert|6.31|m3|cuft|abbr=off}} per second. 
 
 The Agly shows typical [[season]]al [[:wikt:fluctuation|fluctuations]] like other small rivers in southern France. The highest levels of the river are in [[winter]] and [[spring]], from December to May inclusive, with the highest level in February. They are followed by a rapid fall in the flow during the low water period that goes from late June to early October.
