 '''Rapids''' are found on [[river]]s. Rapids are formed by one or more of the following:  constriction, obstruction, gradient, and flow rate.  For instance, when water is flowing swiftly over a rocky river bed, rapids can be formed.  Rapids are typically found in or near the [[mountain]]s, due to the element of gradient.  Formally, the word  " rapids "  is always plural, (like  " scissors "  and  " trousers " ), but is often used in the singular when speaking of a specific rapid or when it would be grammatically awkward; e.g.,  " Sweet's Falls Rapids vs. Sweet's Falls Rapid).  The word  " rapid "  means  " very fast. " 
 
 Because of the splash made by the water going over rocks, rapids are also called  " whitewater " . Some people enjoying whitewater canoeing or whitewater rafting as a sport.
