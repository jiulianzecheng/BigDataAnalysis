'''Reborrowing''' is when words of a certain [[language]] are borrowed into a different language, when the new language creates new words using the [[Loanword|loanwords]] or [[Morpheme|roots]] they borrowed, and either when the newly created words are introduced to the language that the old loanwords came from. 
 
 Examples of this can be found in many languages. 
 
 == From Greek to English, and back into Greek == 
 English uses many loanwords borrowed from [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], which is why many [[Science|scientific]] words are made using words and word roots from these same languages. For example, the word  " [[telegram]] "  comes from the Greek roots  " tele- " , which means  " distant/far " , and  " -gram/-graph " , which means  " writing " , thus a telegram is a machine that sends written messages from far away. This word came back into Greek as τηλεγράφημα ''telegráfima''.
