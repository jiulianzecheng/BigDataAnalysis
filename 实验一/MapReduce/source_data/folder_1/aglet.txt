[[File:Three Different Aglets.jpg|thumb|250px|Different types of aglets]] 
 
 An '''aglet''', or '''aiglet''', is the small tip on the end of a [[Shoelaces|shoelace]] or [[rope]]. It can be plastic or metal. It keeps the [[fibre]]s from fraying or unwinding. This makes it easier to hold, and easier to feed through a hole, such as a [[grommmet]], [[eyelet]], or lacing guides. 
 
 The word ''aglet'' (or ''aiglet'') comes from the [[Old French]] word, ''aguillette'' (or ''aiguillette''), which means ''needle''. < ref > Picken, Mary Brooks: ''The Fashion Dictionary'', Funk and Wagnalls, 1957. (1973 edition {{ISBN|0-308-10052-2}}) < /ref >  This in turn comes from ''acus'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''needle''. An aglet is like a small needle at the end of a cord. 
 
 ==Types== 
 There are two main types of aglets. Some are purely functional, that is to simply stop fraying, while others can also be [[decoration|decorative]]. Decorative aglets are on the end of decorative cords, such as [[bolo tie]]s, or on the [[aiguillette]]s of military dress uniforms. 
 
 Aglets today are most often made of [[plastic]]; they also have been made of metal, glass, and stone. Many were highly [[ornament]]al and made of metals such as [[silver]]. Before the invention of [[button]]s, they were used on the ends of [[ribbon]]s to hold clothing together. Sometimes they were formed into small figures. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called these an  " aglet baby "  in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''. 
 
 Homemade aglets can be made out of [[adhesive tape]], [[wax]], [[resin]], [[glue]], [[Yarn|thread]], [[Heat-shrink tubing|heat shrink]] or [[metal]] [[Tubing (material)|tubing]], and by simply [[knot]]ting or [[melting]] the end of a lace or cord. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/agletrepair.htm |title=Eight ways to make an aglet |publisher=Fieggen.com |date=2009-05-05 |access-date=2009-06-08}} < /ref >  During the [[Great Depression]], aglets were made out of paper and glue.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
