 '''Shipwrecking''' is an event that causes a [[shipwreck]], such as a [[Ship collision|ship striking something]] that causes the [[ship]] to sink; the stranding of a ship on rocks, land or shoal; poor maintenance; or the destruction of a ship either intentionally or by violent weather. 
 
 == Causes == 
 [[File:Estonia ferry2.jpg|thumb|Life raft from [[MS Estonia|MS ''Estonia'']], which sank in the [[Baltic Sea]] in 1994.]] 
 Factors for the loss of a ship may include: 
 * poor [[naval architecture|design]] or failure of the ship's equipment or [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] - [[submarine hull|pressure hull]] 
 * instability, due to poor design, improperly stowed [[cargo]], cargo that shifts its position or the [[free surface effect]] 
 * [[navigation]] errors and other human errors, leading to [[collision]]s (with another ship, rocks, an [[iceberg]] ({{RMS|Titanic}}), etc.) or [[Ship grounding|running aground]] (''[[Costa Concordia]]'') 
 * bad weather and powerful or large waves or [[gale]] winds: This often leads to capsizing, also referred to as ''foundering'' 
 * warfare, [[piracy]], [[mutiny]], or [[sabotage]] including: [[gun]]s, [[torpedo]]es, [[depth charge]]s, [[naval mine|mine]]s, [[bomb]]s and [[missile]]s 
 * fire 
 * [[biofouling]], such as accumulation of [[polychaete]] and other [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]] on wood hulls 
 * overloading - either cargo or icing, and displacement exceeding the [[Waterline|plimsoll line]] 
 * intentional sinking ([[scuttling]]) 
 ** to form an [[artificial reef]] 
 ** for [[wreck diving]] 
 ** use as a [[target ship]] for training or testing weapons 
 ** as a [[blockship]] to create an obstacle to close a harbour, river, etc. against enemy ships 
 ** to prevent a ship from falling into an enemy's hands (e.g. [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|''Admiral Graf Spee'']]) 
 ** to destroy a derelict ship that poses a menace to navigation 
 ** as part of an [[False insurance claims|insurance scam]] 
 
 === Design and equipment failure === 
 The hallmark of a shipwreck due to poor design is the [[capsize]] of Swedish warship ''[[Vasa (ship)|Wasa]]'' in [[Stockholm]] harbour 1628. She was too narrow, had too little [[ballast tank|ballast]] and her lower cannon deck had too low free-board for good seaworthiness. Poor design allowed the ferry [[MS Herald of Free Enterprise|MS ''Herald of Free Enterprise'']] to put to sea with open [[roll-on/roll-off]] bow doors, with tragic consequences. 
 Failure or leaking of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] is a serious problem that can lead to the loss of [[buoyancy]] or the [[free surface effect]] and the subsequent sinking of the vessel. Even the hulls of large modern ships have cracked in heavy [[storm]]s. Leaks between the hull planks of wooden vessels are a particular problem.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} 
 
 Equipment failure caused the shipwreck of [[cruiseferry]] ''[[Estonia (ship)|Estonia]]'' in 1994. The stress of stormy seas on hull and bow especially caused the bow visor to break off, in turn tearing the watertight bow door open and letting seawater flow onto the car deck. She capsized with tragic consequences.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} Failure of pumps can lead to the loss of a potentially salvageable ship with only a minor leak or fire.{{citation needed|date = August 2017}} 
 
 Failure of the means of propulsion, such as [[engine]]s, [[sail]]s or [[rigging]], can lead to the loss of a ship. When the ship's movement is determined only by currents or the wind and particularly by storms, a common result is that the ship is unable to avoid natural hazards like [[rock (geology)|rocks]], shallow water or [[tidal race]]s.  Loss of propulsion or steering can inhibit a ship's ability to safely position itself in a storm, even far from land.  Waves attacking a ship's side can overwhelm and sink it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} 
 
 === Instability and foundering === 
 Instability is caused by the [[centre of mass]] of the ship rising above the [[metacenter]] resulting in the ship tipping on its side or [[capsize|capsizing]].  To remain buoyant, the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel (known as downflooding). Clearly for the ship to float, the normally-submerged parts of the hull will be watertight, but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow ventilation to compartments, including the engine room, for crew access, and to load and unload cargo. In a capsize, water can enter these openings if not watertight. If a ship sinks after capsizing, or as a consequence of a leak in the hull or other water ingress, it is often described as having ''foundered'' or ''foundering''. Large ships are designed with [[compartment (ship)|compartments]] to help preserve the necessary buoyancy. 
 
 === Bad weather ===

 [[File:Bounty Sinking 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|''Bounty'' awash in the Atlantic Ocean during Hurricane Sandy approximately 90 miles southeast of Hatteras, N.C., 29 Oct. 2012.]] 
 On 25 October 2012, the tall ship ''[[Bounty (1960 ship)|Bounty]]'' (a replica of the original HMS ''[[HMS Bounty|Bounty]]'') sank in a hurricane. The vessel left [[New London, Connecticut]], heading for [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], initially going on an easterly course to avoid [[Hurricane Sandy]]. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/29/us/sandy-bounty-ship/index.html |first=Mark |last=Morgenstein |title=Sandy claims 'Bounty' off North Carolina |work=[[CNN]] |date=29 October 2012 |access-date=29 October 2012}} < /ref >  On 29 October 2012 at 03:54 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], the ship's owner called the [[United States Coast Guard]] for help during the hurricane after losing contact with the ship's master.

 Poor weather can cause several problems: 
 * high winds 
 * low visibility 
 * cold weather 
 * high waves 
 
 Wind causes [[Ocean surface wave|wave]]s which result in other difficulties. Waves make navigation difficult and dangerous near shallow water. Also, waves create buoyancy stresses on the structure of a hull. The weight of breaking waves on the fabric of the ship force the crew to reduce speed or even travel in the same direction as the waves to prevent damage. Also, wind stresses the rigging of sailing ships. 
 
 The force of the wind pushes ships in the direction of the wind. Vessels with large [[windage]] suffer most. Although powered ships are able to resist the force of the wind, sailing vessels have few defences against strong wind. When strong winds are imminent, sailing vessels typically have several choices: 
 * try to position themselves so that they cannot be blown into danger 
 * shelter in a [[harbour]] 
 * [[anchor]], preferably on the [[windward and leeward|leeward]] side of a [[landform]] 
 
 Many losses of sailing ships were caused by sailing, with a following wind, so far into a [[bay]] that the ship became trapped upwind of a [[lee shore]], being unable to sail into the wind to leave the bay. Low visibility caused by [[fog]], mist and heavy rain increase the navigator's problems. Cold can cause metal to become [[brittle]] and fail more easily. A build-up of ice can cause instability by accumulating high on the ship, or in severe cases, crush the hull if the ship becomes trapped in a freezing sea. 
 
 === Rogue waves === 
 According to one scientist who studies [[rogue wave]]s,  " two large ships sink every week on average, but the cause is never studied to the same detail as an air crash. It simply gets put down to 'bad weather'. " < ref > {{cite web|title=Ship-sinking monster waves revealed by ESA satellites|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Ship-sinking_monster_waves_revealed_by_ESA_satellites|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724043458/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Ship-sinking_monster_waves_revealed_by_ESA_satellites|archive-date=July 24, 2014|url-status=live|date=July 21, 2004}} < /ref >  Once considered mythical and lacking hard evidence for their existence, rogue waves are now proven to exist and known to be a natural ocean phenomenon. Eyewitness accounts from mariners and damages inflicted on ships have long suggested they occurred; however, their scientific measurement was only positively confirmed following measurements of the  " [[Draupner wave]] " , a rogue wave at the [[Draupner platform]] in the [[North Sea]] on January 1, 1995, with a maximum wave height of {{convert|25.6|m}} (peak elevation of {{convert|18.5|m}}). During that event, minor damage was also inflicted on the platform, far above sea level, confirming that the reading was valid. Their existence has also since been confirmed by [[satellite imagery]] of the ocean surface. < ref > {{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3917539.stm | work=BBC News | title=Freak waves spotted from space | date=July 22, 2004 | access-date=May 22, 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Fire=== 
 Fire can cause the loss of ships in many ways. The most obvious way would be the loss of a wooden ship which is burned until watertight integrity is compromised (e.g. [[Cospatrick (ship)|''Cospatrick'']]). The detonation of cargo or ammunition can cause the breach of a steel hull. An extreme temperature may compromise the durability properties of steel, causing the hull to break on its own weight. Often a large fire causes a ship to be abandoned and left to drift (e.g. [[MS Achille Lauro|MS ''Achille Lauro'']]). Should it run aground beyond economic salvage, it becomes a wreck. 
 
 In extreme cases, where the ship's cargo is either highly combustible (such as [[oil]], [[natural gas]] or [[gasoline]]) or explosive ([[nitrate]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, [[ammunition]]) a fire onboard may result in a catastrophic [[conflagration]] or [[explosion]]. Such disasters may have catastrophic results, especially if the disaster occurs in a harbour, such as the [[Halifax Explosion]]. 
 
 === Navigation errors === 
 [[File:Wreck of Harvard.jpg|thumb|Shipwreck of {{SS|Harvard}} on Point Arguello, California, 1931]] 
 Many shipwrecks have occurred when the crew of the ship allowed the ship to collide with rocks, [[reef]]s, [[iceberg]]s, or other ships. Collision has been one of the major causes of shipwreck. Accurate navigation is made more difficult by poor visibility in bad weather. Also, many losses happened before modern navigation aids such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[radar]] and [[sonar]] were available. Until the 20th century, the most sophisticated navigational tools and techniques available - [[dead reckoning]] using the [[magnetic compass]], [[marine chronometer]] (to calculate [[longitude]]) and ships [[logbook]] (which recorded the vessel's heading and the speed measured by [[Chip log|log]]) or [[celestial navigation]] using [[marine chronometer]] and [[sextant]] - were sufficiently accurate for journeys across oceans, but these techniques (and in many cases also the charts) lacked the precision to avoid reefs close to shore. 
 
 The [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]], which claimed nearly 2,000 lives and was one of the greatest [[maritime disaster]]s in the [[history of the British Isles]], is attributed to the mariner's inability to find their longitude. This led to the [[Longitude Act]] to improve the aids available for navigation. [[Marine chronometer]]s were as revolutionary in the 19th century as GPS is today.  However the cost of these instruments could be prohibitive, sometimes resulting in tragic consequences for ships that were still unable to determine their longitude, as in the case of the ''[[Arniston (ship)|Arniston]]''. 
 
 Even today, when highly accurate [[Navigation system|navigational equipment]] is readily available and universally used, there is still scope for error. Using the incorrect horizontal [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] for the [[chart]] of an area may mislead the navigator, especially as many charts have not been updated to use [[GPS|modern data]]. It is also important for the navigator to appreciate that charts may be significantly in error, especially on less frequented coasts. For example, a recent revision of the map of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] in the [[South Atlantic]] showed that previous maps were in some places in error by several kilometres. 
 
 Over the centuries, many technological and organizational developments have been used to reduce accidents at sea including: 
 * [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] 
 * [[Pilotage]] aids including [[lighthouse]]s and [[sea mark]]s 
 * Basic [[navigation]] tools such as the [[magnetic compass]], [[nautical chart]], [[marine chronometer]], [[sextant]], [[log (speed)|log]] and [[sounding line]] 
 * Advanced navigation tools such as radio communication, [[radar navigation]], [[gyrocompass]], [[sonar]], hyperbolic [[Radio navigation]] and [[satellite navigation]] 
 * Inspection of [[shipbuilding]] quality and maintenance of seaworthiness of the ship such as  " [[A1 (shipping)|A1 at Lloyd's]] " 
 * [[military intelligence|Intelligence]] and better defences to protect the ship from acts of violence, war and piracy 
 * Use of fireproof/nonflammable materials to prevent fires from spreading rapidly, and modern fire-fighting agents such as [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents|gases]] and [[Fire extinguisher#Foams|foams]] that do not compromise the buoyancy and stability of the vessel as quickly as water. 
 * Built-in devices to delay flooding long enough for rescue ships to retrieve survivors and/or tow the ship to the nearest [[shipyard]] for repairs, such as [[watertight compartment]]s and [[pumps]].
