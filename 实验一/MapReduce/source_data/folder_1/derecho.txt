'''Derechos''' are a widespread and damaging group of [[severe thunderstorm]]s. The word  " derecho "  means  " straight "  in Spanish. That is because it is a straight line of thunderstorms. They often have rapid forward [[speed]]s. They have a distinct appearance on [[radar]]s, known as [[bow echo]]es. They have very strong winds. Unlike other thunderstorms, derecho storms usually hit suddenly, with strong [[hurricane]] force winds, spraying [[rain]], and frequent [[lightning]] from all directions. A derecho can create heavy damage in only a short time. These storms usually occur in [[North America]], although they can occur elsewhere around the world. Winds with these storms can exceed 100 mph in certain cases.
