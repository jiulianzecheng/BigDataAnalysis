 '''Technophobia''' is the fear, or dislike, of more advanced [[Technology|technical]] devices. Technophobia has occurred since the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Very often, artists show technophobia in their works. Two examples of this are [[Frankenstein]], and the [[movie]] [[Metropolis (movie)|Metropolis]]. The [[Luddite|Luddites]] were a movement of [[textile]] workers who fought against the use of [[Machine|machines]], in the 19th century. 
 
 == Technophobia in anabaptist groups == 
 [[Anabaptist]] groups, such as the [[Amish]] or the [[Mennonites|Mennionites]] are often shown as being against all modern technology. This image is false, and largely relies on ignorance. These groups are not technophobic, they simply judge the technologies they use: if the technology is useful for the group as a whole, and it does not pose a risk in making the group fall apart, the technology is usually kept. As an example, [[Tractor|tractors]] are used, because they help with [[Farming|agriculture]]. [[Car|Cars]], on the other hand, are often not used, because they help drive the community apart.

 In a study, done between 1992 and 1994 University students in different countries were asked if they were technophobic: < ref > Matthieu Guitton: [http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/759/description#description ''Computers in Human Behavior''] Elsevier, accessed 5 July 2018. < /ref > < ref name= " studentstudy " > {{Cite journal|last1=Weil|first1=Michelle M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Lah rry D.|date=March 1995|title=The psychological impact of technology from a global perspective: A study of technological sophistication and technophobia in university students from twenty-three countries|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/074756329400026E|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=11|issue=1|pages=95–133|doi=10.1016/0747-5632(94)00026-E}} < /ref >  Among the 3.392 participants in the United States, 29% identified as strongly technophobic. < ref name= " W & R table-2 " > {{cite journal|last1=Weil|first1=Michelle M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Larry D.|year=1995|title=A Study of Technological Sophistication and Technophobia in University Students From 23 Countries|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_computers-in-human-behavior_spring-1995_11_1/page/95|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=11|issue=1|pages=95–133|doi=10.1016/0747-5632(94)00026-E|quote= " Table 2. Percentage of Students in each country who possessed high levels of technophobia " }}; several points are worth noting from Table 2. First, a group of countries including Indonesia, Poland, India, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Mexico and Thailand show large percentages (over 50 %) of technophobic students. In contrast, there are five countries which show under 30 % technophobes (USA, Yugoslavia - Croatia, Singapore, Israel and Hungary). The remaining countries were in between these two groupings. < /ref >  As a comparison, 58% of the Japanese pariicipants identified as technophobic, in India, the number was 82%, and in Mexico, it was 53%. < ref name= " W & R table-2 "  / >
