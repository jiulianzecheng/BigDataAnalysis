'''Eicosanoids''' (or '''icosanoids''') are [[hormones]] made of [[lipids]]. They are [[signal (biology)|signaling molecules]] made by the [[oxidation]] of 20-carbon [[fatty acid]]s. 
 
 They have control over many bodily systems. They influence [[Cell growth|growth]] during and after physical activity, [[inflammation]] or [[Immune system|immunity]] after the intake of [[toxicity|toxic]] compounds and [[pathogen|pathogens]]. They are also messengers in the [[central nervous system]]. 
 
 The networks of controls that depend upon eicosanoids are among the most complex in the human body. < ref > Soberman, Roy J.  &  Christmas, Peter 2003.
