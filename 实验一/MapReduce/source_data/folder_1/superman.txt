 == Superman's real life origins == 
 Mr. Siegel imagined an evil villain who read minds and dreamed of conquering the world. He went by the name of the Superman. In the 1930s, [[Hitler]], the infamous nazi villain from real life, was talking about getting rid of the Jews and communists. This was because he believed that Germans he called [[Aryans]] were supermen. Mr. Siegel, who was Jewish, found this disgusting. But one night, Mr. Siegel tossed and turned in his bed, and had a horrible time getting to sleep. When he awoke, Superman became the superman we know today, and the evil version disappeared.{{fact|date=July 2010}}  
 
 ==Story== 
 Superman was born on a [[planet]] called [[Krypton]]. His name was '''Kal-El'''. When his father, [[Jor-El]], found out that their planet was going to [[explosion|explode]], Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a [[spacecraft]] to save him. Kal-El was found and [[adoption|adopted]] by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]]. They named him '''[[Clark Kent]]'''. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called [[Smallville, Kansas]] in the [[United States]]. (There is a television series called ''[[Smallville]]'' about his time growing up there) 
 
 As he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is almost [[Invincibility|invulnerable]] (most things cannot hurt him). He is strong enough to lift almost anything and he can [[fly]]. Superman can also run and move faster than a [[bullet]]. He has [[X-ray]] [[vision]] (he can see through walls, he is not able to see through lead), and [[heat]] vision (shooting heat from his eyes). He can [[freeze]] things with his frost [[breath]] and his super-breath (which allows him to blow super hard). He decides to use his special powers to fight [[crime]] and save people in [[danger]]. He wears a blue and red [[costume]] and [[cape]] to keep his [[alter ego]] (his real name) a [[secret]]. He saves the entire world many times. 
 
 Superman moves to a [[city]] called [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and becomes a [[journalist|reporter]] for the [[Daily Planet]], a [[newspaper]]. He falls in love with another reporter, [[Lois Lane]]. 
 
 His weaknesses are [[radioactivity|radioactive]] [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] from his home planet that are called  " [[kryptonite]] " ; and [[magic]]. Sometimes his enemies use it to hurt him. Diffferent Kryptoinites have different effects on him, Blue Kryptonite makes people able to control him using [[hypnosis]], green weakens his powers and slowly kills him, black makes him evil, and red has many different effects on him (each piece of red kryptonite affects him differently). There is also gold, white, and jewel kryptonite. Some of Superman's enemies use [[magic]] to hurt him.
