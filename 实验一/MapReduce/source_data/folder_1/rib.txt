 A '''rib''' is a [[bone]] that forms a structure around the [[thorax]] of [[vertebrate]]s. This is known as the [[rib cage]]. Humans have 24 ribs, 12 on each side.  
 
 It is a common [[urban legend]] that male humans have one fewer pair of ribs than female humans. However, this is not true. This came from the [[Christian]] [[bible]] explaining the creation of [[Eve]] from the rib of [[Adam]].
