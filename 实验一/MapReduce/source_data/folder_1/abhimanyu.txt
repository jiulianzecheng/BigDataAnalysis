 Abhimanyu was the son of arjuna. He is described as a great person in the epic mahabharata. He was one of the youngest warrior to be killed in the war. Besides Arjun from pandavas side he only knew about the chakravayuh but not completely. It was the reason of his fall. His uncles tried to save him but after each obstacle in the chakravayuh everyone was left behind. He was the only one to reach in the middle. 
 His son Parikshit ruled over after Yudhistra.
