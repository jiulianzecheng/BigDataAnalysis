 '''''Phorusrhacos''''' was a [[genus]] of giant [[predator]]y [[flightless bird]]s which lived in [[Patagonia]]. The [[terror birds]] lived in [[woodlands]] and [[grasslands]]. Remains are known from several [[wikt:locality|localities]] in the [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]], of [[Argentina]]. 
 
 ''Phorusrhacos'' stood around 2.5 meters (8 & nbsp;ft) tall and weighed approximately 130 kilograms (280 & nbsp;lbs). < ref > Alvarenga, Herculano M. F.  &  Höfling, Elizabeth 2003.

''Papéis Avulsos de Zoologia'' '''43''': 55-91 [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_pdf & pid=S0031-10492003000400001 & lng=en & nrm=iso & tlng=en PDF fulltext] < /ref >  It was nicknamed the  " Terror Bird "  for obvious reasons: it was one of the largest [[carnivore|carnivorous]] birds ever to have existed, along with ''[[Titanis]]'', ''[[Kelenken]]'' and ''[[Brontornis]]''. Its rudimentary wings had claws shaped like a meat hook for tackling prey, which was then killed with the massive beak. It ate small mammals and [[carrion]].  
 
 Its skull was up to sixty centimeters long, armed with a powerful, hook-tipped beak. The structure of the beak and the large claws on the toes show that this was a [[bird of prey]]. It raced over the grassy plateaus and hills of Patagonia, catching small [[reptiles]] and [[mammals]] leaving larger prey to its more massive relatives such as ''Brontornis''.
