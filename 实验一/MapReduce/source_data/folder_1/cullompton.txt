 == How the town got its name and spelling == 
 There are two ideas about how the town got its name. The first idea is that its name means [[farm]] near the [[River Culm]] and that the name ''Culm'' means twisted, because the river has lots of bends < ref > {{cite book | last = Hesketh  | first = Robert  | title = Devon Placenames  | url = https://archive.org/details/devonplacenames0000hesk  | publisher = Bossiney Books  | year = 2008  | location = [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]  | isbn =978-1-899383-98-6 }} < /ref >   The second idea is that it is named after [[Columba of Terryglass|Saint Columba of Tir-de-Glas]] who some people think came to Cullompton in 549 AD. < ref > {{Citation | last = Grubb  | first = Geoffrey W | chapter = St. Columba and Cullompton | page = 16 |year =1986| editor-last = Pugsley| editor-first = David | title = Old Cullompton | publisher = Maslands}} < /ref >
