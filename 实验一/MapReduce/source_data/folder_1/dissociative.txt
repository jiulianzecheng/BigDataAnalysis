 '''Dissociatives''' are a type of [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic]] [[drug]]. Dissociatives can make the user feel separated or ''dissociated'' from their body and environment. They are often used as [[anesthetic]], to make people [[unconscious]] during operations or for other medical uses. < ref > This is your brain on dissociatives: the bad news is finally in [https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_health1.shtml] < /ref >   
 
 Dissociatives change users [[Perception|perceptions]] and can cause [[Hallucination|hallucinations]], [[trance]] and [[euphoria]]. They are usually only used on animals or children, who won't notice these effects. However, for this reason they are also used [[Recreation|recreationally]] or for fun. In many countries however, they are [[Illegal drugs|illegal]] to use for this purpose. Some dissociatives, like that produced from ''[[Salvia|Salvia divinorum]]'', enter the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] and attach to [[opioid]] [[Receptor (cell biology)|receptors]] in the [[brain]]. < ref name= " :0 " > What are the effects of common dissociative drugs on the brain and body?
