 '''Flax''' (also known as '''common flax''' or '''linseed''') (''Linum usitatissimum'') is a type of  [[flowering plant]]. 
 
 The [[wood fibre|fibres]] of flax are used to make [[linen]]. High-quality [[paper]] used in [[banknote]]s is also made from flax fibres. 
 An [[oil]] (linseed oil) can be made from the dried [[ripe]] flax [[seeds]].  
 Flax has been used for a long [[time]] in such tasks as making [[Bow (weapon)|bows]] and [[candle]]s. 
 
 ==Toxicity== 
 Flax seed and its oil are nontoxic and are safe for human consumption. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/Noticeinventory/ucm181935.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|title=GRAS Petition by Flax Canada, Agency Response Letter GRAS Notice No. GRN 000280|author=Cheeseman MA|date=24 August 2009|access-date=1 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617234254/https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/Noticeinventory/ucm181935.htm|archive-date=17 June 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 However, like many common foods, flax contains small amounts of cyanogenic [[glycoside]]. < ref > {{cite journal|journal=Br J Nutr|year=1993|volume=69|issue=2|pages=443–53|title=High alpha-linolenic acid flaxseed (''Linum usitatissimum''): some nutritional properties in humans|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_british-journal-of-nutrition_1993-03_69_2/page/443|authors=Cunnane SC, Ganguli S, Menard C, Liede AC, Hamadeh MJ, Chen ZY, Wolever TM, Jenkins DJ|pmid=8098222|doi=10.1079/bjn19930046|doi-access=free}} < /ref >  This is ''nontoxic'' when eaten in normal amounts.
