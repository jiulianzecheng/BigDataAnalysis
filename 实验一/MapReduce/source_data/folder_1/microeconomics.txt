'''Microeconomics''' is the science of how people make decisions at the small scale. It is different from [[macroeconomics]] which looks at how the [[economy]] works as a whole ( " on aggregate " ). < ref > Krugman, Paul; Robin Wells with Margaret Ray and David Anderson (2012) ''Microeconomics: Second Edition in Modules'' Worth Publishers New York, New York page 5 < /ref >  In microeconomics, we might look at how a person chooses what to buy at the store, or how many things a company will make. Some parts of microeconomics include ''Consumer Theory'' and ''Theory of the Firm'', which study how people and businesses make decisions. [[Game theory]] looks at how people make decisions when the outcome (how something ends) depends on what decision another person makes; when agents are said to act  " strategically " .
