 '''''Toxoplasma gondii''''' is a [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]] that can infect almost all [[warm-blooded]] [[animal]]s, including [[human]]s. < ref > Weiss, Louis M.  &  Kami Kim, eds. 2011.

 In humans, it is one of the most common parasites. < ref > {{cite web|title=CDC – About Parasites|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about.html|accessdate=12 March 2013}} < /ref >  Blood test show that up to a third of the world population has been or is infected with ''T. gondii''.

 Although mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks, infection with ''T. gondii'' generally produces no symptoms in healthy human adults. < ref name=CDCdisease > {{cite web|title=CDC Parasites – Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection) – Disease|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/disease.html|accessdate=12 March 2013}} < /ref >  But in infants, [[HIV/AIDS]] patients, and others with [[Immune system|weakened immunity]], infection can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness ('''toxoplasmosis'''). < ref name=Dubey/ > < ref name=CDCdisease / > < sup > p77 < /sup > 
 
 Infection in humans and other warm-blooded animals can occur 
 # by eating raw or undercooked meat containing ''T. gondii'' tissue cysts. < ref > Tissue cyst = group of cells with a hard shell around them < /ref > < ref name=Tenter2000 > {{cite journal|title=Toxoplasma gondii: from animals to humans|journal=International Journal for Parasitology |date=2000 |volume=30|issue=12–13|pages=1217–58|pmid=11113252|doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(00)00124-7|pmc=3109627|last1=Tenter|first1=Astrid M.|last2=Heckeroth|first2=Anja R.|last3=Weiss|first3=Louis M.}} < /ref >   
 # by drinking water or eating anything contaminated with oocysts. < ref > Oocyst: a hardy, thick-walled spore able to survive for long periods outside a host. The [[zygote]] develops within the spore, which acts to protect it during transfer to new hosts. This method is found in some [[Apicomplexa]]. < /ref >  in the [[faeces]] of an infected animal. < ref name=Tenter2000 / > 
 # from a [[blood transfusion]] or [[organ transplant]] 
 # or by transmission from mother to [[foetus]] across the [[placenta]]. < ref name=Tenter2000 / > 
 
 The parasite can only [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproduce]] in the [[intestine]]s of members of the [[Felidae|cat family (felids)]]. < ref name=Dubey2009History > {{cite journal|last=Dubey|first=JP|title=History of the discovery of the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii|journal=International Journal for Parasitology |date=2009|volume=39|issue=8|pages=877–882|pmid=19630138|doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.01.005}} < /ref >  Felids are therefore the [[Host (biology)|definitive hosts]] of ''T. gondii'', with all other hosts defined as 'intermediate hosts'.
