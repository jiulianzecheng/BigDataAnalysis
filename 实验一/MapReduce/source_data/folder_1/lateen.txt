 A '''lateen''' (from French ''latine'', meaning  " Latin " < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lateen |title=lateen |publisher=Dictionary.com |access-date=January 2, 2017}} < /ref > ) or '''latin-rig''' is a [[Triangle|triangular]] [[sail]] set on a long [[yard (sailing)|yard]] mounted at an [[angle]] on the [[mast]]. It runs in a [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] direction. 
 
 [[Wikt:date|Dating]] back to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[navigation]], the lateen became the favorite sail of the [[Age of Discovery]]. This was mainly because it allowed a boat to [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]  " against the wind " . It is common in the [[Mediterranean]], the upper [[Nile River]], and the northwestern parts of the [[Indian Ocean]]. < ref > A. Ansted, ''A Dictionary of Sea Terms'' (London: Gill, 1898), p. 232 < /ref >  It is the standard [[Rigging|rig]] for [[felucca]]s and [[dhow]]s. Another form is used on small [[recreation]]al boats like the [[Sailfish (sailboat)|Sailfish]] and [[Sunfish (dinghy)|Sunfish]]. < ref > staff, 'On the Racing Circuit', ''Motor Boating'', (May 1964), p. 168 < /ref > 
 
 == Operation == 
 A square sail is a very simple device. It catches a following wind and pushes the vessel forward. < ref name=Campbell1 > I.C. Campbell, 'The Lateen Sail in World History', ''Journal of World History'', Vol. 6, No. 1 (1995), pp. 1–2 < /ref >  The lateen sail is more [[complex]]. It is [[wikt:set|set]] at an angle to the wind. It works by creating a difference in [[air pressure]] between the two sides ([[wikt:concave|concave]] and [[wikt:convex|convex]]) of the sail. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  This is the same way a [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft sail]] works. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  This is why the lateen sail is considered the [[ancestor]] of the fore-and-aft sail. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  The advantages of the lateen sail is that it is effective in lighter winds. It causes less [[drag (physics)|drag]] and so is more [[wikt:efficient|efficient]]. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  It allows the vessel to sail much  " closer to the wind "  (meaning it can sail at up to about 45 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s into the wind). < ref name=Campbell1/ >  This made the lateen sail a very important [[invention]]. < ref name=Campbell1/ >

 [[File:Rigging-lug-sail.svg |thumb|left|100px|{{Center|A lug sail}}]] 
 The lateen sail did not directly come from the square sail. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  There was an intermediate sail type called the [[lug sail]]. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  It was one of the earliest [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. It was developed for use on the [[Indian Ocean]]. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  [[Sailor]]s knew that the wind does not always come from behind the vessel. They learned that the square sail could be made more efficient by turning it on the [[mast]] so it remained at a [[right angle]] to the wind. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  When used with a [[keel]] and some form of [[steering]], it provided more options. Instead of simply sailing downwind, the vessel could move in different directions relative to the direction of the wind. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  If the wind came from the beam (side of the ship), rotating the sail became less effective. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  But, if the [[luff (sail)|luff]] (edge of the sail) was pointed into the wind and kept taut, the sail would provide forward movement. < ref name=Campbell1/ >   This could be made more effective if the yard (or [[spar]]) holding the sail is sloped downward into the wind. < ref name=Campbell1/ >  From this discovery came the lug, then the lateen.

 In [[ancient history]] the square sail was used in the Mediterranean. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://nabataea.net/sailing.html |title=Ancient Sailing and Navigation|publisher=Nabataea.net |access-date=January 2, 2017}} < /ref >  It was used on [[sea]]going ships of the [[Phoenician|Phoenicians]], [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In [[Northern Europe]] at this time, they only used the square sail. This was even after the ships in the Mediterranean were using the triangular lateen sails. 
 
 The [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century]] [[caravel]] was a favorite type of ship used in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and Spanish [[voyages of discovery]]. < ref name=texA & M > {{cite web |url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/shiplab/01George/caravela/htmls/Caravel%20History.htm |title=History of the Caravel |publisher=Nautical Archaeology at Texas A & M University |access-date=January 2, 2017 |archive-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506151022/http://nautarch.tamu.edu/shiplab/01George/caravela/htmls/Caravel%20History.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In addition to their [[wikt:distinctive|distinctive]] single [[sterncastle]], they carried lateen sails. < ref name=texA & M/ >  During this time the caravel developed into a very fast and highly [[wikt:maneuver|maneuver]]able ship. < ref name=texA & M/ >  Two of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s ships, the ''[[Niña]]'' and the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' were caravels. He repeatedly praised the ''Niña'' as his fastest and favorite ship. < ref name=texA & M/ >
