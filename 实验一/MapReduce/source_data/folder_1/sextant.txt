 A '''sextant''' is an object used for [[navigation]] which measures angles. The user is able to measure the angle between the horizon and an object in the sky, such as the sun, a star, or a planet. It originally could measure angles up to 60Â°, which was one sixth of a circle. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/conscitech/sextant |title=Sextant from |first= |last= |work=McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology  |year=2006 |quote= |accessdate=16 June 2011}} < /ref >  This is how it got its name from the [[Latin]] word ''sextus'' (six). It helps work out positions of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]].
