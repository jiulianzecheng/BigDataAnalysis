 '''OpenNIC''' uses an alternative [[Domain Name System]], so users can access more websites than they can on the  " normal "  internet. Users can still access the  " normal "  internet. 
 
 Users can register [[domain name|website names]] for free on OpenNIC, whereas doing so on the  " normal "  internet is usually not free. 
 
 == Top level domains == 
 The  " normal "  internet has websites that end in things like  " .com " ,  " .org "  or  " .net "  - these endings are called [[Top Level Domain|Top Level Domains or TLDs]]. OpenNIC allows its users to access other website names in addition to those on the  " normal "  internet.
