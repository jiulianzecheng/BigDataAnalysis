 A '''tetradecagon''' or '''14-gon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 14 sides and 14 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular tetradecagon == 
 A ''[[regular polygon|regular]] tetradecagon'' has Schl√§fli symbol {14} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated heptagon, t{7}, which alternates two types of edges. 
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular tetradecagon takes up is 
 
 The [[area]] of a [[Regular polygon|regular]] tetradecagon of side length ''a'' is given by 
 : < math > \begin{align}A  & = \frac{14}{4}a^2\cot\frac{\pi}{14}=\frac{14}{4}a^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{7}+4\sqrt{7}\cos\left({\frac{2}{3}\arctan{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{9}}}\right)}{3}\right)\\ 
 & \simeq 15.3345a^2\end{align} < /math > 
 
 ''a'' is the length of one of its sides. 
 
 == Dissection== 
 [[Coxeter]] states that every parallel-sided 2''m''-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the ''regular tetradecagon'', ''m''=7, and it can be divided into 21: 3 sets of 7 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a [[Petrie polygon]] projection of a [[7-cube]], with 21 of 672 faces.  < ref > [[Coxeter]], Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 < /ref >  The list [http://oeis.org/A006245 A006245] defines the number of solutions as 24698, including up to 14-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.

 ==Numismatic use== 
 The regular tetradecagon is used as the shape of some commemorative gold and silver [[Malaysia]]n coins, the number of sides representing the 14 states of the Malaysian Federation. < ref > ''The Numismatist'', Volume 96, Issues 7-12, Page 1409, American Numismatic Association, 1983. < /ref >
