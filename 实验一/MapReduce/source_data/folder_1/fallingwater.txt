 '''Fallingwater''' is the name of the summer house [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed in 1935 for the Kaufmann family. It is in the [[woods]] over a [[waterfall]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. It is a nationally listed national historic place, < ref name=nhlsum/ > < ref name=nris/ >  and some say it is the most famous private house in the world. < ref > Toker, Frank 2003. ''Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright, E.J. Kaufmann, and America's most extraordinary house''. Knopf. {{ISBN|1400040264}} < /ref > 
 
 The house actually sits low in the [[valley]] over the [[stream]], but looks dramatic from further downstream. It has large terraces, and some of them stick straight out and hang right over the waterfall or the stream. There are windows and glass doors, with only narrow steel supports between them, wrapping all the way around the [[living room]]. There are also windows going all the way from the floor to the ceiling in all three stories of the tower. Most of the house is made from stone. 
 
 There are strong [[horizontal]] and [[vertical]] lines in the design of the house. It resembles the horizontal and vertical lines in the [[rock formation]]s and other natural features. The waterfall can be heard everywhere in the house. Wright wanted there to be a close connection between inside and outside, and for the house itself to be natural. < ref > . Hoffmann, Donald 1993. ''Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater: the house and its history''. New York: Dover Books, Introduction. {{ISBN|0486274306}} [http://www.wright-house.com/frank-lloyd-wright/fallingwater.html Fallingwater: Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece house above the waterfall] Retrieved 2012-12-24 < /ref > 
 
 The large, cave-like living room has a big fireplace built on a large rock that comes up out of the floor. This was Edgar Kaufmann's favorite place to sit before the house was built. A stairway hangs down from the main floor to the stream. A glass hatchway lets people go down it from the living room. 
 
 Some of the furniture is built right into the house. Many shelves are attached directly into the wall, sticking out without any supports that can be seen, like the [[floor]] < nowiki/ > s and terraces of the house itself. 
 
 There is a guest house on the hill behind the main house. It is connected by an  " S "  shaped, covered walk. There is a plunge pool beside the guest house. 
 
 In 1991, members of the [[American Institute of Architects]] named the Fallingwater house the  " best all-time work of American architecture " .
