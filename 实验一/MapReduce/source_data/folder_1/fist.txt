 A '''fist''' is the term given to the hand when the four fingers are clenched, and the thumb closed over the first finger. In this solid form, it can be used for striking in combat. The half-closed fist may be used for some tasks, like knocking. 
 
 Making a fist is virtually unknown amongst other [[primates]]. Their fingers have different proportions to humans.
