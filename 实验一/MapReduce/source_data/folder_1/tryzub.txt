The '''Tryzub''' is a Ukrainian [[National symbols|national symbol]] and the modern small coat of arms of [[Ukraine]]. It is a golden trident of a particular shape on a blue background. It was also the coat of arms of the Rurikid dynasty and the [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]] state in the past. There are different theories about the origin and meaning of the Tryzub, but none of them is widely accepted. The Tryzub is often thought to be a stylized image of a falcon or an anchor-cross. The concept of  " Tryzubets "  is much broader than the Tryzub and refers to graphic symbols that are genetically related to it, which can be found in many cultures around the world. The Tryzub was used as a symbol by the Rurikid princes, but it is not clear if it was a symbol only of the Rurikids or an ancient symbol of the Slavs.
