 '''Ayyavazhi''' ({{lang-ta|அய்யாவழி}},  " path of the master " ), is a Hindu denomination with one god that started in South [[India]] in the middle of the 19th century. The 'zhi' ({{lang|ta|ழி}}) in the word, 'Ayyavazhi', is a retroflex, ri. 
 
 Ayyavazhi is considered as a branch of Hinduism, officially. It is widespread in [[Tamil Nadu]]'s southern districts of [[Kanyakumari]], [[Tirunelveli]], and [[Thoothukudi district]] and some parts of [[Kerala]]. As one of the fastest growing faiths of southern India, its growth had been noted in the [[Christian]] [[missionary]] reports of the mid-19th century. 
 
 The ideas and philosophy of the religion are based on the teachings of [[Ayya Vaikundar]] and the religious texts [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] and [[Arul Nool]]. Most followers of Ayyavazhi do not regard themselves as different from Hinduism. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Ayyavazhi began to be seen firstly by the large number of people gathering to worship [[Ayya Vaikundar]] at [[Swamithoppe]], which is at that time ''poovandanthoppe''. The majority of the followers of Ayyavazhi were from the poor group of the society. For the Christian missionaries it gives a big challenge in their converting mission from its beginning. Although the majority of these followers were from the [[Chanar]] cast, some sources say that a large number of people from other castes also followed this religion.  
 
 By the middle of nineteenth century, Ayyavazhi had come to be recognised as a separate religion, grown well in the region of South [[Travancore]] and South [[Tirunelveli]]. The growth in its number of followers had increased from [[1840]]s. After the death of Vaikundar, the religion was spread on the basis of his teachings and the religious books ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' and ''Arul Nool''. The five [[Citars]], who were the disciples of Ayya Vaikundar, and their descendants travelled to several parts of the country and carried the mission of Ayyavazhi. At that time the [[Payyan dynasty]] started ruling  [[Swamithoppe]] [[pathi]], while other Pathis came under the control of the followers of Ayya. Hundreds of [[Nizhal Thangals]] (places of worship) were built across the country. Currently [[Bala Prajapathi Adikalar]], one of descendant of Payyan dynasty is said to be as the leader of Ayyavazhi. He has laid foundations for a large number of Nizhal Thangals all over [[South India]]. And now seeing the growth of the religion the day of birth of Vaikundar, [[Ayya Vaikunda Avataram]] was announced as a holiday by the government for the districts of [[Tirunelveli]] and [[Tuticorin]] in 2006 while in the district of [[Kanyakumari]] it was announced as a holiday earlier. 
 
 == Scriptures and holy places == 
 
 The holy books of Ayyavazhi are the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] and the [[Arul Nool]], and they are the source of [[Ayyavazhi mythology|the religion's mythology]]. The holy book states that the ''Akilattirattu Ammanai'' was written down by [[Hari Gopalan Citar]] by hearing the contents of Akilam told by [[Narayana]] to his wife [[Lakshmi]]. There was no definite history about the beginning of Arul Nool; but the followers believe that it was written by [[Citars]] and by those who get possessed by divine power. It contains the prayers, [[hymn]]s and ways for the worship in Ayyavazhi, [[religious practices]], [[prophesies]] and also many rules.  
 
 To the Ayyavazhi devotees, there are five holy places, called [[Pathi]]s, with  " [[Panchappathis]] "  as the most important. The temple of [[Thalaimaippathi|Swamithoppepathi]] is the head of the Ayyavazhi religion. The [[Vakaippathi]], where 700 families were sent to [[Thuvayal Thavasu]] by [[Vaikundar]] was approved as a [[Pathi]] in [[Akilam]] although this place has no direct association with the activities of [[Vaikundar]]. There is a big disagreement within the followers of Ayyavazhi as to the holiness of some of the places of worship. The [[Avatharappathi]] in [[Thiruchendur]] was accepted by the book ''Akilam'' as a Pathi, but as some of the followers believe that the place at which the present temple is located is not the exact place where Ayya Vaikundar incarnated from the sea, they disagree with the other devotees. There are also some followers which strongly quarrel Thiruchendur as a Pathi though they accept it as a secondary holy site.
