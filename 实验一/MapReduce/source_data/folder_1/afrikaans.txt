 '''Afrikaans''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] mainly spoken in [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]].  It was originally the [[dialect]] that developed among the [[Afrikaner]] [[Protestant]] [[settler]]s, the unfree workers, and [[slavery|slaves]] brought to the [[Cape Town|Cape]] area in southwestern South Africa by the [[Dutch East India Company]] ({{lang-nl|Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie}} - VOC) between [[1652]] and [[1705]]. Most of these first settlers were from the [[Netherlands]], though there were also many from [[Germany]], some from [[France]], a few from [[Scotland]], and various other countries. The unfree workers and slaves were [[Malay people|Malays]], and [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] in addition to the native [[Khoi]] and [[Bushmen]]. 
 
 Research by [[J. A. Heese]] says that until [[1807]], 36.8% of the ancestors of the White Afrikaans speaking population were Dutch, 35% were German, 14.6% were French and 7.2% non-white (of [[Africa]]n and/or [[Asia]]n origins).   
 Heese's figures are questioned by other researchers, however, and especially the non-white component quoted by Heese is very much in doubt. 
 
 A sizeable minority of those who speak Afrikaans as a first language are not [[white people|white]]. The dialect became known as  " Cape Dutch " . Later, Afrikaans was sometimes called  " African Dutch "  or  " Kitchen Dutch " . Afrikaans was considered a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[dialect]] until the early [[20th century]], when it began to be widely known as a different language. The name ''Afrikaans'' is simply the Dutch word for ''African'', and the language is the African form of Dutch.
