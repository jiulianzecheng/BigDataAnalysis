 Movie cameras use a lens to focus reflected light from objects. This light makes an image that is used by an image sensor or a light-sensitive material inside a movie camera. These images are created one after another and saved for later processing and viewing as a motion picture. Images captured with [[photography|photographic emulsion]] create a series of invisible images on the [[Photographic film|film stock]]. [[Chemical]]s are used to  " developed "  this into visible images. The images on the film stock are projected for viewing the [[movie|motion picture]].   
 
 When using an electronic image sensor, the image creates an electrical charge for each [[pixel]] in the image. This kind of camera is a [[video camera]]. These are processed and stored in a video file. This file can later be processed or shown.  
 
 Cinematography is used in many fields of [[science]] and [[business]] as well as for [[entertainment]] and [[mass communication]].
