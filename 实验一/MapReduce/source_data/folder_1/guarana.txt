 '''Guarana''' or '''Guaraná''' ({{IPA-all|gu̯a.ra.'na}}, {{IPA|[gu̯a.ɾa.'na]}} or {{IPA|[gu̯a.ɹa.'na]}}), ''Paullinia cupana'' ([[synonymy|syn.]] ''P. crysan, P. sorbilis''), is a [[shrub]] or small [[tree]] in the [[Sapindaceae]] family. It is native to [[Venezuela]] and northern [[Brazil]]. The [[seed]] of the Guaraná [[fruit]] is a [[stimulant]] with [[Thermogenics|thermogenic]] and [[diuretic]] properties. 
 
 The guaraná fruit's color ranges from orange to red and contain black [[seed]]s which are partly covered by white [[aril]]s. The color contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs; this has formed the basis of a myth ''(see below)''. < ref name= " culthistplants " > {{cite book | author=Sir Ghillean Prance, Mark Nesbitt | title=Cultural History of Plants | publisher=Routledge | year=2004 | location=New York | page=179}} < /ref > 
 
 Guaraná plays an important role in [[Tupí people|Tupi]] and [[Guaraní]] Brazilian culture. The name 'guaraná' is derived from the [[Tupi-Guarani]] word ''wara'ná''. These [[tribe]]s believed, it was [[magic]]al, a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength. They also tell the myth of a 'Divine Child' that was killed by a [[serpent]] and whose eyes gave birth to this plant. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Guaraná is mainly used as an ingredient in [[soft drink]]s and [[energy drink]]s. It is also used as a [[dietary supplement]], generally to promote weight loss. In addition, it may be an ingredient in other foods. 
 
 ===Beverages=== 
 In addition to other chemicals, the guaraná plant contains [[caffeine]] (sometimes called  " guaranine " ), [[theophylline]], and [[theobromine]]. Water extracts of the guarana plant are [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]]s due to the content of these [[alkaloids]]. Energy drink manufacturers typically add [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] caffeine or caffeine derived from coffee [[decaffeination]], though many advertise  " natural "  caffeine from the seeds of guaraná. 
 
 [[File:Flask rot-061017.jpg|thumb|right|Guaraná [[soft drinks]] are very popular in Brazil.]] 
 
 [[Brazil]] produces several brands of soft drink from guaraná extract that contain no added caffeine. Each differs greatly in flavour; some have only a slight guaraná fruit taste.  They are typically fizzy and sweet, with a very fruity [[aftertaste]]. Most guaraná drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries, such as [[Paraguay]]. Major brands include [[Guaraná Antarctica]], Guaraná Schin from [[Schincariol]] and Guaraná Brahma from [[AmBev]], [[Kuat]], and [[Guaraná Jesus]], a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it. < ref > http://www.s-t.com/daily/07-99/07-11-99/b03bu068.htm < /ref >  Many local producers also create drinks not for export. 
 
 ===Using it to lose weight===

 Studies involving guaraná show benefits to cognitive function. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Haskell | display-authors = etal | title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose evaluation of the acute behavioural effects of guarana in humans | journal=J Psychopharmacol | year=2006 | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–70 | doi = 10.1177/0269881106063815 | pmid = 16533867 | s2cid = 2974554 }} < /ref >  They have not been evaluated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] ([[FDA]]) or any similar government agencies. In the United States, guaraná holds a GRAS-status, i.e. ''generally regarded as safe'' and must be labeled as ''not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.'' 
 
 The [[Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics]] published a study in [[June]] [[2001]]. This study shows  an average 11.2 & nbsp;pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of [[yerba mate]], guaraná and [[damiana]], compared to an average 1 & nbsp;pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Anderson, T and Foght, J | title=Weight loss and delayed gastric emptying following a South American herbal preparation in overweight patients | journal=J Hum Nutr Diet | year=2001 | volume=14 | issue=3 | pages=243–250 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00290.x | pmid=11424516 | url=http://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00290.x}} < /ref > 
 
 A [[university]] study in [[Brazil]] of guaraná extract showed a [[platelet]] aggregation decrease of up to 37% of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from [[arachidonic acid]] of up to 78% of control values. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Bydlowski SP | display-authors=etal | title=An aqueous extract of guarana (Paullinia cupana) decreases platelet thromboxane synthesis | journal=Braz J Med Biol Res | year=1991 | pages=421–4 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pmid=1823256 | url=http://www.rxresearchgroup.com/mlm/ingredients/guarana.shtml#2 | access-date=2007-06-12 | archive-date=2007-03-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304100949/http://www.rxresearchgroup.com/mlm/ingredients/guarana.shtml#2 | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs, an arterial blood clot can develop, resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Nicolaou, KC | display-authors = etal | title=Synthesis and biological properties of pinane-thromboxane A2, a selective inhibitor of coronary artery constriction, platelet aggregation, and thromboxane formation | journal=Proc.

 Other studies have shown [[antioxidant]], [[antibacterial]], and [[fat]] cell reduction (when combined with [[conjugated linoleic acid]]) properties in guaraná  < ref > {{cite journal | author=Terpstra | display-authors=etal | title=The Decrease in Body Fat in Mice Fed Conjugated Linoleic Acid Is Due to Increases in Energy Expenditure and Energy Loss in the Excreta | journal=J Nutr | year=2002 | pages=940–945 | volume=132 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/jn/132.5.940 | pmid=11983818 | url=http://www.nemhaupt.de/obesity.htm | access-date=2007-06-12 | archive-date=2010-07-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730002141/http://www.nemhaupt.de/obesity.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Although side-effects of guaraná are rare, drugs.com recommends,  " When considering the use of herbal supplements, consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable. Additionally, consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbal/health supplements may be beneficial, and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous " . Drugs.com also advises not to mix guaraná with [[ephedrine]]. < ref > [https://www.drugs.com/mtm/guarana.html Guarana Uses, Side Effects  & amp; Warnings - Drugs.com] < /ref > 
 
 ==What guarana is made of== 
 Guaraná seeds consist of mostly reddish [[vegetable fiber]] and [[resin]] with a small amount of oil and water. Guarana contains different amounts of [[caffeine]], [[theobromine]], [[theophylline]] and other alkaloids, compared to coffee, tea, [[Yerba mate|mate]], or [[cocoa]].

 ===Guaranine and caffeine=== 
 The chemical  " guaranine "  is identical to [[caffeine]] coming from other sources, for example [[coffee]], [[tea]] and [[Yerba mate|mate]]. Guaranine, theine, mateine are all official synonyms for caffeine.  < !--See talk page before desputing any of the above information.-- >
