 '''Proteins''' are long-chain [[molecule]]s built from small units known as [[amino acid]]s. They are joined with [[peptide bond]]s. 
 
 They are [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]] of one or more [[polypeptide]]s folded into a round or [[fibrous protein|fibrous]] shape. < ref > See [[protein structure]] for more on this topic. < /ref > 
 
 A polypeptide is a single linear [[polymer]] chain of [[amino acid]]s. The [[sequence]] of amino acids in a polypeptide comes from the [[DNA sequence]] of a [[gene]]. < ref > see [[Translation (genetics)]] and [[RNA splicing]] for a fuller account. < /ref >  The [[genetic code]] specifies 20 standard amino acids. Shortly after synthesis, some amino acids are chemically modified. This alters the folding, stability, activity, and function of the protein. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s. 
 
 Proteins are essential to all [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Like other biological [[macromolecule]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s), proteins take part in virtually every process in cells: 
 # Many proteins are [[enzyme]]s that [[catalysis|catalyze]] (help to happen) biochemical reactions and are vital to [[metabolism]]. 
 # Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as in muscle and in [[cell]]s. The [[cytoskeleton]] is a system of [[scaffolding]] that keeps cell shape. 
 # Other proteins are important in [[Signal transduction|cell signalling]], [[antibody|immune response]]s, and [[cell division]] 
 
 == Formation == 
 Proteins are formed by a process called  " protein synthesis " . The [[cell]] [[Transcription (genetics)|reads]] the genetic information of the [[DNA]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translates]] it into a protein. In [[eukaryote]]s, this process begins in the [[cell nucleus]] and ends in the [[ribosome]]. In [[prokaryote]]s all of it is done in the [[cytoplasm]].

 Proteins have different functions depending on their shape and sequence. They can be found in [[meat]] or [[muscle]]. They are used for growth and repair, as well as for strengthening the bones. They help to make tissue and cells. They are in [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, fungi, bacteria, and in the [[human]] body. 
 
 [[Muscle]]s are mostly made of protein. When protein is digested, it is broken down into amino acids. These amino acids can then be used to build new protein. Proteins form an important part in foods like [[milk]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat]], [[fish]], [[bean]]s, [[spinach]], and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. There are four factors that determine what a protein will do. The first is the order of the amino acids. There are 20 different types of amino acids. The second is the little twists in the chain. The third is how the entire structure is folded up. The fourth is whether it is made up of different sub-units. [[Haemoglobin]] molecules, for example, are made of four sub-units. 
 
 === Damaging mutations === 
 Most proteins are [[enzymes]], and [[mutations]] may slow them or stop them working. 50% of human [[cancer]]s are caused by mutations in the [[tumour]] suppressor [[p53]]. < ref > Fersht, Alan 1999. ''Structure and mechanism in protein sequence''. New York: Freeman, p1. {{ISBN|0716732688}} < /ref > < ref > Sidransky D. and Hollstein M. 1996. ''Annual Review of Medicine'' '''47''', p285. < /ref >  p53 is a protein which regulates [[cell division]]. < ref > Surget S; Khoury M.P.  &  Bourdon J.C. 2013. Uncovering the role of p53 splice variants in human malignancy: a clinical perspective. ''OncoTargets and Therapy''. '''7''': 57–68. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24379683] < /ref > 
 
 === Lifespan === 
 Once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period. Then they are and recycled by the cell's machinery. A protein's lifespan is measured by its half-life. This covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. 
 
 === Essential amino acids === 
 Proteins are necessary in an animal's diet, since they cannot make all the amino acids they need (they can make most of them). They must get certain amino acids from food. These are called the ''essential amino acids''. Through [[digestion]], animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids. The amino acids are then used in [[metabolism]] to make the [[enzyme]]s and structures the body needs. 
 
 There are nine essential amino acids for humans, which are obtained from food. The nine essential amino acids are: [[histidine]], [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], [[lysine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[valine]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002222.htm|title = Amino acids: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia}} < /ref >  Meat contains all the essential amino acids humans need; most plants do not. However, eating a mixture of plants, such as both [[wheat]] ''and'' [[peanut butter]], or [[rice]] ''and'' [[bean]]s, provides all the essential amino acids needed. [[Soy]] products like [[tofu]] provide all the essential amino acids—as does [[quinoa]]—but these are not the only way to get the protein humans need. 
 
 Proteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder. [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] gave proteins their name. < ref name= " Hartley " > {{cite journal|last=Hartley|first=Harold|date= 1951|title=Origin of the word 'protein'|journal=Nature|volume=168|issue=244|page=244|doi=10.1038/168244a0|pmid=14875059|bibcode=1951Natur.168..244H|s2cid=4271525|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v168/n4267/abs/168244a0.html}} < /ref >  Hundreds of other scientists have studied proteins since him.
