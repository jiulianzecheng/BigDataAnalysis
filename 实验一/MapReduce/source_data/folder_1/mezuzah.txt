 Most people put their mezuzah on the front doorpost, but [[halakha]] requires that every room with 36 square feet (but not bathrooms) should have a mezuzah on the right side of the doorpost. 
 
 There are 4 different types of writing styles for Mezuzahs: Beis Yosef, Arizal, Sephardi and Alter Rebbe. 
 
 In the United States, prices for Mezuzahs range from US$50 for a cheap mezuzah, $85 for a medium quality, and $130-150 for a high-quality mezuzah. 
 
 The idea for mezuzah comes from [[Deuteronomy]], chapter 6:  " And you shall inscribe them on the doorposts (mezuzot) of your house and on your gates. " < ref name=MJL / >
