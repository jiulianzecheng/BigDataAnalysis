It was the capital of [[Korea]] during the [[Taebong]] kingdom and [[Goryeo]] dynasty. The city is near the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] close to the border with [[South Korea]].

 The 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] left the city under North Korean control. Due to the city's close distance to the border with South Korea, Kaesong has hosted exchanges between the two countries as well as the jointly run [[Kaesong Industrial Region]]. 
 
 As of 2009, the city had a population of 192,578. < ref name= " Nkorea2009 " > {{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP & f=tableCode:240|title=City population by sex, city and city type|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2009|accessdate=2013-12-16}} < /ref >
