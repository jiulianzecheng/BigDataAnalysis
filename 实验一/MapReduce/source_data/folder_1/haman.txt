 [[Haman]] the [[Agag]]ite was a [[person]] from the [[Book of Esther]]. He was known for a plan to [[kill]] all the [[Jews]] but was [[hanged]] on the [[gallows]] he built to hang [[Mordechai]]. 
 
 ==Book of Esther== 
 Haman [[son]] of [[Hammedatha]] the [[Agag]]ite was an advisor to [[King]] [[Ahaseurus]]. Haman wanted everyone to bow down to him but a [[Jew]] named Mordechai refused to do that. So Haman convinced King Ahaseurus to give him the power to make his own [[law]]s as if he were the [[king]]. Haman then started [[casting lots]] called [[Purim]] to figure out when to [[kill]] the [[Jews]]. [[Queen]] [[Esther]] then invited Ahaseurus and Haman to a [[feast]] and asked them to go to another one after it. Haman noticed that [[Mordechai]] still wouldn’t bow to him and complained about it to his [[wife]] Zeresh so Zeresh told Haman to build a [[gallows]] to [[hang]] Mordechai. Haman built the [[gallows]] but then Ahaseurus [[reward]]ed Mordechai for saving his [[life]] by forcing Haman to lead Mordechai across town on a [[horse]] shouting “so shall be done for the [[man]] whom the [[king]] wishes to [[honour]]”.  Then Esther told Ahaseurus that she was [[secret]]ly a Jew and Haman wanted to [[kill]] her and all her [[tribe]]. So Ahaseurus had Haman hanged on the same [[gallows]] Haman had built to hang Mordechai.
