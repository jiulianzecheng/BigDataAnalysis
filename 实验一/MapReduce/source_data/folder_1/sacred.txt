The words '''sacred''' or '''holy''' are sometimes used interchangeably and are often misunderstood to mean  " important "  or  " special "   instead of  " set apart "  and  " pure. " 
 
 According to Websters 1828 Dictionary (the more accurate definition given the spiritual context- Christian and beyond), sacred means  " ...separated from that which is common, vulgar, polluted, or open... or Holy. "  Holy, means  " Properly, whole, entire or perfect, in a moral sense. Hence, pure in heart, temper or dispositions; free from sin and sinful affections. Applied to the Supreme Being, holy signifies perfectly pure, immaculate and complete in moral character... " 
 
 Most [[religion]]s have sacred [[book]]s that provide teachings or doctrines associated with the religion. These books are  " set apart, "  from other books published and associated with the religion. There is a deeper connection to these books over the others.   
 
 For [[Christian]]s this book is called the [[Bible]].  [[Islam|Muslim people]]s have another book, they call the [[Qur'an]]. [[Jew]]s call their book the [[Torah]]. Similarly, the [[Book of Mormon]] is also considered as a sacred book in [[Mormonism]].  
 
 Some religious people deem specific [[wikt:place|places]] sacred because of their mention in the sacred books. [[Jerusalem]] is seen as sacred by [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. [[Mecca]] is sacred in Islam, and Ise Grand Shrine in [[Mie Prefecture]] is sacred in Japanese [[Shinto]]. In [[Hinduism]] the river [[Ganges]] is seen as holy.
