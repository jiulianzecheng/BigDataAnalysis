 A '''touchscreen''' is a [[computer]] [[Computer monitor|screen]] that can be used by touching it with a [[finger]] or a [[stylus]] pen, instead of using a [[computer mouse|mouse]] and [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]]. It can be described as a [[touchpad]] with a screen built-in to it. 
 
 Today, all kinds of [[computer hardware|devices]], both big and small, make use of touchscreens. However, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s have made them popular and are the most widely known and used products that use touchscreens. 
 
 ==History== 
 In 1965, E.A Johnson of [[England]]’s [[Royal Radar Establishment]], invented < ref > {{cite web|url= http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Touch-Screen.htm|title= Who Invented Touch Screen Technology?|author= Mary Bellis|publisher= About Money|accessdate= May 21, 2015  < !-- 11:21 AM -- > }}{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  the first touchscreen that was used in the U.K for [[air traffic control]] up until around 1995. The first resistive touch screen was invented by [[G. Samuel Hurst]] in 1975, and produced in 1982. Back in 1970, Hurst and nine friends discovered that a touchscreen on a computer monitor made for an excellent method of interaction. Pressure on the cover sheet allowed [[voltage]] to flow between the X [[wire]]s and the Y wires, which could be measured to indicate [[Coordinate system|coordinates]]. This discovery helped found what we today refer to as resistive touch technology (because it responds purely to pressure rather than [[electrical]] [[conductivity]], working with both a stylus and a finger). 
 
 Much later in 2005, three friends from France created a multi-touch screen capable of tracking any numbers of fingers. By 2005, their company named JazzMutant released the [[Lemur]], a [[music]] controller with a multi-touch screen [[User Interface|interface]]. This new technology helped influenced the [[TactaPad]] also made in 2005. Two years later, in January 2007, the [[iPhone]] was released, which was controlled entirely by a multi-touch screen. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/iphone1.htm/|title=iPhone Touch Screen - How it Works|date=2015|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=May 21, 2015  < !-- 9:30am -- > |archive-date=May 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521043150/http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/iphone1.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It, and the [[iPad]] which came out in September 2010, were very successful and would eventually lead to more companies adding touchscreens to their products. They included [[Samsung]], [[Sony]], [[Motorola]], and many companies who adopted the touch-friendly [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]. < ref > {{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/2011/12/23/144185699/timeline-a-history-of-touch-screen-technology |title= Timeline: A Histoty of Touch Screen Technology |author= Nicole Cohen |website= NPR |date= 26 December 2011 |publisher= Disqus |accessdate= May 21, 2015  < !-- 11:15 AM -- >  }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/from-touch-displays-to-the-surface-a-brief-history-of-touchscreen-technology/|title=The Past, Present, and Future of Touch|date=2015|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=May 7, 2015  < !-- 11:25pm -- >  }} < /ref > 
 
 In response to the popularity of touchscreens, [[Microsoft]], maker of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] family of [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s, would introduce a new interface in [[Windows 8]] in 2011, which has large [[tile]]s that are meant to be easily usable with touch technology like those on tablets. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-8-revealed-microsoft-goes-tablets-and-tiles-with-next-os/|title=Windows 8 revealed: Microsoft goes tablets and tiles with next OS|last=Ferguson|first=Tim|work=ZDNet|date=2011-06-02|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en}} < /ref >  It would come out the next year, along with the [[Microsoft Surface]] tablet. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/25/microsoft-windows-8-launch-live|title=Microsoft Windows 8 launch and Surface event – as it happened|last=Halliday|first=Josh|date=2012-10-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Usage== 
 Because of how easy they are to use, touchscreens can be found in many places. Along with general [[computing]] and [[consumer electronics]] devices such as smartphones, tablets, [[smartwatch]]es and [[personal computer]]s, touchscreens are also widely used on [[kiosk]]s, which are used for information systems in [[City|cities]] and [[museum]]s. They are also found on [[machine]]s including [[Automatic Teller Machine]]s (ATMs), [[cash register]]s and [[retail]] point-of-sale terminals, [[GPS]] [[navigation]] systems such as those in [[car]]s and other [[vehicle]]s, [[medical]] equipment and [[industrial]] [[Control panel (engineering)|control panels]]. The touchscreen built into kiosks use simple point and click interaction. [[Interactive whiteboard]]s, which can be found in many [[school]]s, also use a simple form of touch technology. < !-- basic mechanical switching in many cases-- > 
 
 ==Types== 
 [[File:TouchScreen capacitive.svg|thumb|Capacitive touchscreen diagram]] 
 Different kinds of touchscreens work in different ways. There are two main technologies used for touchscreens: 
 * A ''resistive touchscreen'' has a layer of [[electrical conductor|conducting]] [[polyester]] [[plastic]]. When you press on it, you force the polyester to touch the glass and complete an [[electric circuit]]. A [[computer chip|chip]] under the screen identifies the [[Coordinate plane|coordinates]] of the place you touched. These screens can sense only one finger at a time and get confused if you try to press in two places at once. They are often used in industrial equipment because it is strong and responds to any kind of input, such as when wearing [[gloves]]. 
 * A ''capacitive touchscreen'' has multiple layers of [[glass]]. Both the innermost and outermost layers of glass conduct electricity. The screen behaves like two electrical conductors separated by an [[insulator]]—in other words, a [[capacitor]]. Unlike resistive screens, capacitive screens can easily detect and distinguish more than one press at once. This is called [[multi-touch]]. 
 
 Unlike resistive screens, capacitive screens don’t work if you touch them with a plastic [[stylus]] because the plastic acts as an [[insulator]]. Some stylus pens, such as the [[Apple Pencil]] for the [[iPad Pro]], are made to work with capacitive screens. They are [[pressure]] sensitive and let you to do different things by pushing harder or more gently. For example, you can draw a wider or narrower [[line]] in programs like [[Microsoft OneNote]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]].
