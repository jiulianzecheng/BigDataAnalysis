[[File:Thyroid dummy.jpg|thumb|250px|Where the thyroid is]] 
 
 The '''thyroid''' is one of the largest [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] [[gland]]s in the body. This gland is found in the [[throat]]. The thyroid controls how quickly the body burns [[energy]], makes [[proteins]], and how sensitive the body should be to other [[hormones]]. 
 
 The principal hormones it makes are thyroxine (T4) an triiodothyronine (T3), which is more active. These hormones regulate the growth of many systems in the body. T3 and T4 are synthesised from [[iodine]] and [[tyrosine]]. The thyroid also makes calcitonin, which plays a role in [[calcium]] [[homeostasis]].
