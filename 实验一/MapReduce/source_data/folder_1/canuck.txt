" '''Canuck''' "  is a [[slang]] term for [[Canada|Canadian people]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The term was first used in the [[19th century]], although its [[etymology]] (origin) is not clear. Some possibilities are: 
 * ''kanata'' < sup > 1 < /sup >   " village " 
 * ''Can''ada + -''uc'' ([[Algonquian]] [[noun]] [[Affix|suffix]]) 
 * ''Can''ada + -in''uk'' ([[Inuit]] for  " man " ) 
 * ''Connaught'', a rarely-used term for [[Ireland|Irish]]-French-Canadians. 
 
 ==Meaning== 
 The [[Random House Dictionary]] says that:  " The term Canuck is first recorded about 1835 as an Americanism, originally referring specifically to a French Canadian. This was probably the original meaning, though in Canada and other countries, Canuck now more often refers to any Canadian. "  [http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001031] 
 
 ==Usage and examples== 
 When  " Canuck "  is used by Canadians, the meaning is usually affectionate, friendly or [[patriotic]]. 
 
 The history and use of the term include: 
 * The [[Vancouver Canucks]] hockey team 
 * The [[Canada national rugby union team]] Canucks 
 * The [[Crazy Canucks]], a group of Canadian alpine ski racers who were active in the '70s. 
 * [[Johnny Canuck]], an image of Canadians in early [[political cartoon]]s of the 1860s resisting [[Uncle Sam]]'s bullying. Johnny Canuck was used again in 1942 by [[Leo Bachle]] to defend Canada against the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. 
 * In 1975 in comics by [[Richard Comely]], [[Captain Canuck]] is a super-[[espionage|agent]] for Canadians' [[security]], with Redcoat and Kebec being his sidekicks. (Kebec is claimed to be unrelated to [[Capitaine Kébec]] of a French-Canadian comic published two years earlier.) Captain Canuck had enhanced strength and endurance thanks to being bathed in alien rays during a camping trip.  The captain was reintroduced in the mid-1990s, and again in 2004.
