'''Screamo''' is a [[musical genre]] which came from both [[emo]] and [[hardcore punk]] in the mid 1990s. This genre usually consists of minor chord progressions on guitar with both dissonance and reverb, the time signatures used are usually not in 4/4 instead bands and artists use less used time signatures to create a more tense feel, This genre has both a mellow and chaotic feel to it. The vocals are usually high-pitched screams and lyrics are often poetic or political. 
 An example of some Screamo bands include Saetia, Orchid, Circle Takes the Square, Envy, pageninetynine, and Thursday. < ref > {{Cite web
