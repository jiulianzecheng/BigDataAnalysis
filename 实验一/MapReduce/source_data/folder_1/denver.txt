 '''Denver''' is the [[capital (city)|capital]] and largest [[city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]] and a [[county]] named '''Denver County'''. For this reason, Denver is the [[county seat]] of Denver County. It is at the foot of the [[Rocky Mountains]] on the South Platte River, and was founded in 1858. A nickname for Denver is '''The Mile High City''', because Denver is very high above sea level.  It is at least 5,280 feet (or 1,609 meters) above sea level at a point in the city's state [[Legislature|capitol]] building. The dome at the top of the capitol building is covered in [[gold]]. < ref > {{Cite web

They called it [[Montana City, Colorado|Montana City]]. This was the first settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The settlement faded quickly. By the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of [[Auraria, Denver|Auraria]] (named after the gold mining town of [[Auraria, Georgia|Auraria]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]), and St. Charles City.
