:''A  " vitamin "  is also a [[pill]] that contains vitamins, eaten regularly to keep one healthy.'' 
 [[File:La Boqueria.JPG|thumb|right|Fruits and vegetables are a source of vitamins]] 
 A '''vitamin''' is a [[chemical compound]] that is needed in small amounts for the [[human]] body to work correctly. They include [[Vitamin A]], many [[B vitamin complex|B vitamins]] (like [[Thiamine|B < sub > 1 < /sub > ]], [[Riboflavin|B < sub > 2 < /sub > ]], [[Niacin|B < sub > 3 < /sub > ]], [[Vitamin B6|B < sub > 6 < /sub > ]], and [[Vitamin B12|B < sub > 12 < /sub > ]]), [[Vitamin C]], [[Vitamin D]], [[Vitamin E]], and [[Vitamin K]]. For example, [[citrus fruit]]s such as [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]]s contain vitamin C.  
 
 The term was coined in 1912 by biochemist [[Casimir Funk]], who isolated a complex of micronutrients and proposed the complex be named ''vitamine''. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CMHiWum0Y4C & q=funk & pg=PA16|title=The Vitamins|last=Jr|first=Gerald F. Combs|date=2007-10-30|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080561301|language=en}} < /ref >  By convention the word ''vitamin'' does not include other [[essential nutrient]]s, such as certain minerals, [[essential fatty acid]]s and [[essential amino acid]]s. < ref > {{cite book |last = Maton |first = Anthea |author2=Jean Hopkins |author3=Charles William McLaughlin |author4=Susan Johnson |author5=Maryanna Quon Warner |author6=David LaHart |author7=Jill D.

 Thirteen vitamins are recognized at present. Vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity, and not their structure. Each vitamin name (the word ''vitamin'' followed by a letter) refers to a number of '''vitamer''' compounds which all show the same biological activity. For example, ''[[vitamin A]]'' refers to several different chemicals.  Vitamers convert to the active form of the vitamin in the body. They are sometimes inter-convertible to one another as well. 
 
 The body does not make these chemicals. They come from other places, usually [[food]]. A short term lack of a certain vitamin is usually not a problem, because the body can store vitamins for a short time. Not having a certain vitamin for a longer period of time can lead to different [[disease]]s, depending on the vitamin. Probably the best-known of these diseases is [[scurvy]], which results from not having enough Vitamin C. [[Beriberi]] and [[rickets]] are others.  
 
 Today, many [[Pharmacology|drug companies]] make inexpensive [[pill]]s that contain various vitamins. They help people avoid those diseases. 
 
 Vitamins can be either fat-soluble or water-soluble.  Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) can be stored in the body, and are used when needed. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.immunehealthscience.com/facts-about-vitamins.html|title=Facts about Vitamins|first=AJ|last=NIcolas|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}} < /ref >   Water-soluble ones only stay in the body a short time. 
 
 == Name changes == 
 Currently there are no vitamins F to J.  These existed at some time.  Today they are no longer seen as vitamins.  Some of them were also false leads, and turned out to be something else.  Others were renamed as B vitamins.  Today, the [[B vitamins]] are a whole complex, and not just one vitamin.  
 
 The German-speaking scientists who isolated and described vitamin K (in addition to naming it as such) did so because the vitamin is intimately involved in the 'Koagulation' (clotting) of blood following wounding. At the time, most (but not all) of the letters from F through I were already designated, so the use of the letter K was considered quite reasonable. 
 The following table lists chemicals that had previously been classified as vitamins, as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the B-complex.
