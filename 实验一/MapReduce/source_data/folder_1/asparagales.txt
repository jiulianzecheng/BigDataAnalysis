 '''Asparagales''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s. The order must include the family [[Asparagaceae]], but other families included in the order have varied markedly between different classifications. No one is sure, but it is supposed that this group of plants evolved between the late and early [[Cretaceous]]. But because of the difficult classification of the families, it is not entirely certain when they evolved. Asparagales have a many families, including [[Ashphodelaceae]] (Xanthorrhoeaceae), which includes [[Daylily|daylilies]] and [[Phormium tenax|New Zealand flax]].
