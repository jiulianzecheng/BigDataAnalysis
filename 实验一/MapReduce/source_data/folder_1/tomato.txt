 It is shiny and smooth. It has many small seeds. It is also very good for health.  Most tomatoes are red. The tomato is green when it is unripe. It slowly changes color from green to red as it gets ripe, and as it gets ripe it gets bigger and bigger. There are many different types of tomatoes. Some kinds of tomato are yellow or orange when they are ripe. Tomatoes are used a lot in [[Italian cuisine|Italian food]]. They are also used to make ketchup. Tomatoes are called fruit, because they contain seeds. Tomato seeds get spread around by being eaten by animals. After being eaten the seeds pass through the animal's [[digestive system]].  Although tomatoes are really fruits, many people call them [[vegetables]] and treat them like vegetables when they cook. 
 
 ==History== 
 The tomato is native to western [[South America]]. Wild versions were small, like cherry tomatoes, and most likely yellow instead of red. The Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish and Italian food. The French and northern Europeans wrongly thought that they were poisonous as they are a member of the deadly [[nightshade]] family. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  The leaves and immature fruit contains [[tomatine]], which in large amounts would be toxic. However, the ripe fruit contains no tomatine. 
 
 ==As food==

Unripe green tomatoes can also be breaded and [[fried]], used to make salsa, or pickled. Tomato juice is sold as a drink, and is used in cocktails such as the Bloody Mary.
