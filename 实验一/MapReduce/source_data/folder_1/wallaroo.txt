 A '''wallaroo''' is an [[Australian]] [[macropod]] with its size between the big [[kangaroo]]s and the small [[wallaby|wallabies]]. The name  " wallaroo "  is a mix of wallaby and kangaroo. Most wallaroos are smaller than a kangaroo, and live in open, rocky country. Wallaroo means  " rock kangaroo " . There are three types of wallaroo. They all stand the same way: [[wrist]]s raised, [[elbow]]s close into the body, and [[shoulder]]s back, and all have a large, black nose. 
 
 ==Wallaroo species== 
 === ''Macropus robustus'' === 
 The '''[[eastern wallaroo]]''', ''Macropus robustus'', sometimes called the, '''common wallaroo''' or just '''wallaroo''' lives on the sides of the [[Great Dividing Range]] (which runs for more than 3,000 [[kilometre|km]] along the eastern and south-eastern coast of [[Australia]]). There are four [[subspecies]] of Eastern Wallaroo:  
 * the Eastern Wallaroo, which lives across Australia 
 * the Euro, also widespread 
 * one that lives only on [[Barrow Island, Western Australia|Barrow Island]]

 === ''Macropus bernardus'' === 
 '''[[Woodward's wallaroo]]''' or '''black wallaroo''', ''Macropus bernardus'', lives in steep, rocky ground in [[Arnhem Land]]. Between 60 to 70 [[centimetre|cm]] in length (without tail) it is the smallest wallaroo and the most heavily built. Males weigh 19 to 22 [[kilogram|kg]], females about 13 & nbsp;kg.  
 
 === ''Macropus antilopinus'' === 
 The '''[[antilopine kangaroo|antilopine wallaroo]]''', ''Macropus antilopinus'', also called the [[antilopine kangaroo]], is different to other wallaroos. It is, more like the [[eastern grey kangaroo|eastern]] and [[western grey kangaroo]]s. It lives in groups on the grassy plains and woodlands, where the other wallaroos live by themselves. < ref > {{MSW3 Groves|pages=63-65}} < /ref >
