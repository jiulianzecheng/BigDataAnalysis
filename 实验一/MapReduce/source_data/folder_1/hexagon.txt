 A '''hexagon''' is a [[polygon]] with 6 sides and 6 corners ([[vertex|vertices]]). Like regular [[triangle]]s and [[square (geometry)|squares]], hexagons fit together without gaps. This is known as a [[tessellation]]. Because of this, they are often used for tiling floors. They are also quite common in nature. For example, the [[honeycomb]]s in a [[beehive]] are hexagons.
