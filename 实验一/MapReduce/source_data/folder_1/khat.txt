 '''Khat''' is a [[flowering plant]] native to tropical [[East Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is also known as '''qat''', '''qaat''', '''quat''', '''gat''', '''jaad''', '''chat''', '''chad''', '''chaad''' and '''miraa'''. The plant is grown commercially in [[Kenya]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Oman]], and [[Yemen]]. 
 
 Khat is a [[shrub]]. When grown commercially, the shrubs grow to a size of about 5m, in the wild they can reach about 20m.  
 
 Khat is used as a [[stimulant]] in [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], and  [[Yemen]] the effects are comparable to those of drinking [[tea]] or [[coffee]].  
 
 == Problems == 
 There are some problems with Khat. People can become [[addiction|psychologically addicted]] to the [[drug]]. Many anti-drug organisations, such as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] target this drug. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.dea.gov/slideshow/july2006.htm|title= " 2006 in Pictures " |author=DEA|access-date=2009-05-24|archive-date=2009-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201230723/http://www.justice.gov/dea/slideshow/july2006.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   It is illegal to use in many countries, though not in [[Yemen]]. 
 
 Khat is very popular in [[Yemen]].  Much of the country's farming resources are used for it because farmers get more money than for other [[cash crop]] < nowiki/ > s.  It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards [[irrigation|irrigating]] it. < ref name= " Sanaa "  / >   Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. < ref name= " Sanaa "  / >   It uses so much water that [[groundwater]] levels in the [[Sana'a basin]] are getting lower.  For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of [[Sana'a]] to the coast of the [[Red Sea]]. < ref name= " Sanaa " > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm Yemen's khat habit soaks up water] by Alex Kirby.

 Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million [[Yemeni rial]]s per [[hectare]], while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown.  This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits.  It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 [[hectare]]s to 103,000 hectares. < ref name= " encyemen " > ''Encyclopedia of Yemen (2nd ed)'', Alafif Cultural Foundation, pages 2309–2314, 2003. < /ref >
