 '''Dentin''' or '''dentine''' is [[Calcification|calcified]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that makes up the second layer of [[teeth]]. In the crown (top) of a tooth, dentin is found between [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and [[Dental pulp|pulp]]. In the root of a tooth, it is found between [[cementum]] and pulp. Dentin makes up most of a tooth. < ref > Nanci, Antonio (2013). Ten Cate's Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function. 8th ed. St. Louis, MO: Elsevier, 2013. 165. print. < /ref >  Dentin is [[yellow]]. The yellowness of dentin shows through in a tooth because enamel is [[transparent|semi-translucent]]. 
 
 == Composition == 
 
 Dentin is made up of 
 * 70% [[apatite|hydroxylapatite]] < ref name=Omelyanenko457 > Omelyanenko, Nikolay, Leonid Slutsky, and S. P. Mironov. Connective Tissue: Histophysiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology. Boca Raton: CRC, 2014. 457. print < /ref >  (a [[mineral]] found in teeth and [[bone]]s) 
 * 20% [[organic matter]] < ref name=Omelyanenko457/ >  (matter that comes from living things) 
 * 10% water < ref name=Omelyanenko457/ > 
 
 == Development == 
 
 The process of creating dentin is called '''dentinogenesis'''. It is made by [[odontoblast]]s, a special type of [[cell]] that activates later during [[wikt:formation|formation]] of teeth. Unlike enamel, a tooth can keep making more dentin throughout life. 
 
 == Types == 
 
 Dentin is divided into different types based on when it is made. 
 
 === Primary dentin === 
 
 Primary dentin makes up most of the tooth. It is the thick bulk between enamel and pulp. Primary dentin is the type of dentin a tooth starts out with. It can also be called circumpulpal (surrounding the pulp) dentin. Mantle dentin is a separate, harder but thinner layer that separates primary dentin from the tooth crown. 
 
 === Secondary dentin === 
 
 Secondary dentin is made after a tooth has already appeared in the [[mouth]]. This type of dentin is made throughout life. Newly made dentin is found placed very close to the pulp. It is found between pulp and primary dentin. 
 
 === Tertiary dentin === 
 
 Unlike secondary dentin, tertiary (third in order) dentin is not made continuously throughout life. Tertiary dentine is only made when the tooth is [[wikt:damage|damage]]d.
