 '''Aconcagua''' is the highest [[mountain]] in the [[Americas]], and the highest outside [[Asia]]. The altitude is 6,962 meters, or 22,841 feet. It is one of the [[Seven Summits]]. 
 ==Mortality== 
 [[File:Matthias Zurbriggen in the Tasman Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Matthias Zurbriggen]] reached the summit in 1897.]] 
 Aconcagua is considered to have the highest mortality rate in South America (approximately three deaths per year). This is due to the fact that it is possible to achieve the ascent with relative ease, people without the proper preparation present themselves to make the attempt. Climbers blanch at altitude sickness and extreme weather changes, with strong winds as a result of the mountain's proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. 
 
 Since records began in 1926, more than one hundred people have died on Aconcagua. Between 2001 and 2012, of the 42,731 people who sought to reach the summit of Aconcagua, 33 died, which indicates a mortality rate of 0.77 per 1,000 individuals. 
 
 == Location == 
 It is the [[Andes]], in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. It is in Aconcagua Provincial Park.
