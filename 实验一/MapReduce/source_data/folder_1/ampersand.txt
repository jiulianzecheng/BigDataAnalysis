 The '''ampersand''' (''' & '''), also referred to as the '''and sign''', is a [[logogram]] (a diagram standing for a word). 
 
 It represents the [[Latin]] [[conjunction]] ''et'', which means ''and''. The ampersand symbol is not only a logogram, but also a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]]. It joins the old handwritten [[Latin language|Latin]] letters ''e'' and ''t'' of the word ''et'', so that the word is represented as a single [[glyph]]. < ref > [http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0043-ampersand.htm  " The ampersand  &  more " ] with Kory Stamper, part of the  " Ask the Editor "  video series at Merriam-Webster.com < /ref > 
 
 With a c added on it means  " [[et cetera]] " ,  " and so on " . 
 
 In everyday writing, the ampersand is sometimes written like a reversed 3 with a vertical line through it. < ref > [https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/visual-guide-ampersand/ A Visual Guide to the Ampersand (Infographic)] < /ref >
