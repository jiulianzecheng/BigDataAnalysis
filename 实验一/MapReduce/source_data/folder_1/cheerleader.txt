 A '''cheerleader''' is a person who does '''cheerleading''', or leads [[wikt:cheer|cheer]]s for [[sport]]ing events or during [[competition]]. This is usually done as a group. It is done to keep the spirit of a sports team up.  
 
 == History == 
 This sport is originally from the [[United States]]. It was first seen in the beginning of the 1900s. It was, and is still used to support a local sports group (for example [[American football|football]]).  
 
 Because of the [[Physical fitness|athletic]] ability often needed in cheerleading, many people think cheerleading is a sport. Cheerleaders perform [[wikt:routine|routine]]s that include [[dance|dancing]], [[tumbling]], cheering, [[stunt]]ing and [[jump]]ing. Cheerleading teams can compete in competitions against other cheer teams as well as perform for different sporting events.
