A '''quart''' is a [[unit of measurement]] for [[volume]].  It is a quarter of a [[gallon]] or two [[pint]]s.  Because the [[Imperial unit|imperial system]] and the [[U.S. customary units|American system]] use different gallons, their quarts are different. 
 
 ==Variants== 
 In the American system, there are two different quarts. There is a wet quart and a dry quart. There is only one imperial quart. One U.S. dry quart is smaller than one imperial quart.
