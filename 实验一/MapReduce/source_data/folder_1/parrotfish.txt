 '''Parrotfishes''' are a group of marine [[fish]]es that live in shallow [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] oceans around the world. Previously considered to form the large [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[Wrasse|wrasses]], these fish are now thought to belong to their own [[Family (biology)|family]].  
 
 Their numbers are largest in the [[Indo-Pacific]] region where they are found in and around [[coral reef]]s and [[seagrass]] beds. They play an important and significant role in [[bioerosion]]. < ref > See:

"  Coral reefs 27(4): 967-974. < /ref >  There are about 95 species of parrotfish living today. Parrotfish are very colorful. Their name comes from the [[parrot]]-like [[beak]] formed by their teeth. The [[buccal cavity]] (cheek) of the parrotfish secretes the 'sleeping sack' that the fish sleeps in overnight. It is a semi-[[translucent]] sack which completely surrounds the parrot fish. In the morning the sack is discarded. During the day you will see them on the [[seabed]] floor. 
 
 == The mucus == 
 Some parrotfish species, including the [[queen parrotfish]] (''Scarus vetula''), secrete a [[mucus]] cocoon, particularly at night.
