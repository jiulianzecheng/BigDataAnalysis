 The '''Exopterygota'''  < ref > also known as '''Hemipterodea''' < /ref >  are a [[superorder]] of [[insect]]s. They are in the [[Class (biology)|subclass]] [[Pterygota]] in the [[infraclass]] [[Neoptera]].  
 
 In Exopterygotes the young resemble adults but have externally-developing wings. They undergo a modest change between immature and adult, without going through a [[pupa]]l stage. The nymphs develop gradually into adults through a process of [[ecdysis|moulting]]. 
 
 The Exopterygota are a diverse insect superorder, divided into eight [[Order (biology)|orders]]. They include [[locust]]s, [[thrip]]s, and [[lice]] among other types of insects. 
 
 They are distinguished from the [[Endopterygota]] (or Holometabola) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (meaning literally  " internal winged forms " ) develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage. Exopterygota ( " external winged forms " ) develop wings on the outside of their bodies without going through a true pupal stage, though a few have something resembling a pupa.
