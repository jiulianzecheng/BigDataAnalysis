 '''Marble''' is a [[metamorphic rock]] that developed from [[limestone]]. Most of the material is [[calcite]] (a crystalline form of [[calcium carbonate]], [[calcium|Ca]][[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]] < sub > 3 < /sub > ) and dolomite. It is often used for [[sculpture]], as a [[architecture|building]] material, and for many other purposes. 
 
 The word 'marble' is also used for other stones that can be polished well and for ball shaped objects used for child games.  
 
 'Faux marble' is a wall painting technique that imitates the color patterns of real marble (not to be confused with [[paper marbling]]). Marble dust can be combined with cement or synthetic resins to make ''reconstituted'' or ''[[cultured marble]]''. 
 
 Marble has been used in construction for thousands of years. It was widely used by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Ancient Greek sculpture|sculptors]] and architects. Places named after the stone include [[Marble Arch]], [[London]]; the [[Sea of Marmara]]; [[India]]'s [[Marble Rocks]]; and the towns of Marble, [[Minnesota]]; Marble, [[Colorado]]; and Marble Hill, [[Manhattan, New York]]. The [[Elgin Marbles]] are marble sculptures from the [[Parthenon]] that are on display in the [[British Museum]].  They were brought to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]].

 In the [[construction]] trade, the term  " marble "  is used for any massive, crystalline calcitic rock (and some non-calcitic rocks) useful as building stone.   
 
 === Examples === 
 [[Purbeck marble]] is a [[fossil]]iferous [[limestone]] found in the [[Isle of Purbeck]], a [[peninsula]] in south-east [[Dorset]], England. It has been [[quarry|quarried]] since at least [[Roman Britain|Roman times]] as a decorative building stone. The industry is no longer active. 
 
 [[Tennessee marble]] is really a massive, highly fossiliferous gray to pink to maroon [[Ordovician]] [[dolostone]], known as the [[Holston Formation]] by [[geology|geologists]].   " Tennessee marble "  is not true marble.  Its [[crystal]]line nature gives it a resemblance to marble, especially when polished.  < ref > Rocks are classified by the processes by which they form. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that forms by the precipitation of calcite. Marble is a [[metamorphic rock]] which forms when a limestone is subjected to high pressure and/or temperature. < /ref >

 [[Carrara marble]] is a genuine marble. It is white or blue-grey and of high quality, popular for use in [[sculpture]] and building decor. It is [[quarry|quarried]] at the city of [[Carrara]] in the [[Lunigiana]], the northernmost tip of modern-day [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]].  < br/ > The illustration shows the ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', which is a [[masterpiece]] of [[Renaissance]] sculpture by [[Michelangelo]]. It is in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], and is the only piece Michelangelo ever signed. 
 
 == Industrial use of marble == 
 Colorless marbles are a very pure source of [[calcium carbonate]], which is used in a wide variety of industries.  Finely ground marble powder is a component in [[paint]], [[toothpaste]], and [[plastics]]; calcium carbonate can also be reduced under high heat to [[calcium oxide]] (also known as  " quicklime " ), which has many uses including being a primary component of most [[cement]]s.
