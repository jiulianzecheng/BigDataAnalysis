 '''Poaching''' is the [[illegal]] [[hunting]], killing or capturing of animals. People poach because animal products, such as [[hide]], [[ivory]], horn, teeth and [[bone]], are sold to dealers who make clothes, jewelry and other materials from them. The poaching causes various effects, its most direct impact isÂ [[extinction]], either globally or within a given [[wikt:locality|locality]].  
 
 Poachers catch Indian [[tiger]]s with [[steel]] [[animal trapping|traps]]. This is against the [[law]]. After trapping a tiger, they kill it and sell the [[body]] parts for money. Like the [[rhino]], the tiger is a very endangered species. If the killing does not end, they both face extinction (all of that type of animal dies). Extinction means that someday there may be no Indian tigers or rhinos left on [[earth]].
