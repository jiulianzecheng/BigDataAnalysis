 A '''foam''' is a substance that is formed by trapping gas in [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]].  Gas is present in large amounts so it will be divided in gas bubbles separated by liquid regions which may form films, thinner and thinner when the liquid phase is drained out of the system. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Lucassen|first1=J. |editor1-first=E.
