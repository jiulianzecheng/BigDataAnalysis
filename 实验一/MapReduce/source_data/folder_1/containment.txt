The policy of '''containment''' was a diplomatic strategy of the [[United States]] to prevent the spread of the communism during the [[Cold War]]. Economic support should bind countries to the United States. This was a counteraction against the new Soviet sphere of influence. 
 
 In March 1947 the US president [[Harry Truman]] (1884-1972) announced support for countries which were threatened by military force. This speech is called  " [[Truman Doctrine]] "  nowadays. In detail, he promised support for [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. 
 
 The most important part of the policy of containment was the  " European Recovery Program "  (1948), also known as  " [[Marshall Plan]] " , which should boost the European economy after the destruction in the [[World War II|Second World War]] using—most important—money, successful American economic models, and less European trade barriers.
