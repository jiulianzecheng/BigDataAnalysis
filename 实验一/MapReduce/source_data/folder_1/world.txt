 When people say  " the '''world''' "  they usually mean [[Earth]], especially in a cultural and geopolitical sense. [[Human|Humans]] and all other known living things live in this world. Sometimes  " world "  means another [[planet]].  
 
 Before people discovered that Earth is a planet, they often used  " World "  to mean  " [[Universe]] " . They still sometimes use it to mean all humans or all [[civilization]]. For example, they may say  " end of the world "  to mean the end of [[history]] or humanity.  
 
 Sometimes they mean a small part of Earth such as [[Western world]], [[Islamic world]], [[third world]], [[new world]], or [[ancient world]].
