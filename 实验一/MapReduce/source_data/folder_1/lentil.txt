 The '''lentil''' or '''daal''' or '''pulse''' (''Lens culinaris'') is a bushy [[annual plant]] of the [[Fabaceae|legume]] family. It is a kind of [[vegetable]], grown for its [[Lens (optics)|lens]]-shaped [[seed]]s. It is about 15 inches tall and the seeds grow in pods, usually with two seeds in each. 
 
 == Background == 
 The plant came from the [[Middle East]] and was one of the first crops [[domesticated]] in the world. Humans started eating lentils before they invented [[Ceramic|ceramics]]. 
 
 With 26% [[protein]], lentils have the highest level of protein of any plant after [[soybean]]s and [[hemp]]. Because of this  and their high [[iron]] content, lentils are a very important part of the [[diet]] in many parts of the world, especially in [[India]], which has many [[vegetarian]] < nowiki/ > s. 
 
 There are different kinds of lentils, including a variety of large and small lentils. Lentils come in colors that range from yellow to red-orange to green, brown and black. 
 
 Lentils are sold in many forms, with or without the skins, whole or split. Red, white and yellow lentils are decorticated, i.e., they have their skins removed. 
 
 One variety of yellow  " lentils " , [[Chana]], is in fact not a lentil, but is made from the kernels of [[chickpea]]s. Split [[Pigeon pea]]s (either green or yellow) - that are actually considered [[pulses]], which include peas and beans - are also sometimes referred to and sold as lentils. The [[urid]] bean is also called a  " black lentil " .

 == Preparation == 
 The seeds  need very little cooking. This time is especially short for lentils with their husk removed, such as the common red lentil. Lentils have a distinctive earthy [[flavor]]. They are used to prepare an inexpensive and nutritious [[Lentil soup|soup]] all over [[Europe]] and [[Americas|North and South America]]. Sometimes they are combined with some form of [[chicken]] or [[pork]].  They are frequently combined with [[rice]], which has a similar cooking time. In the Middle East such a dish of lentils and rice is called ''[[mujaddara]]'' or ''mejadra''. Rice and lentils are also cooked together in [[khichdi]], a popular Indian dish. Lentils are used throughout [[India]], the [[Mediterranean]] regions and the [[Middle East]]. In rare cases the lentils are mixed with dairy [[cheese]]. 
 
 Many people in  [[India]] are [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and lentils have long been part of their diet as a common source of protein. Usually, lentils are boiled to a [[stew]]-like consistency with vegetables and then seasoned with a mixture of [[spice]]s to make many side dishes such as [[sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[rasam]] and [[dal]], which are usually served over rice and [[roti]]. 
 
 When lentils are prepared, they are first inspected for damaged lentils, stones and other foreign matter. Then they are rinsed until the water runs through and comes out clear. Some prefer to soak the lentils for a longer time and discard the water. This removes substances that may cause [[indigestion]]. The lentils are then boiled in water or [[broth]]. They may be cooked on the stovetop, or in a [[slow cooker]]. [[Pressure cooker]]s are not recommended, since the small lentils may clog the pressure relief valve, and their quick cooking time means there is little benefit from pressure cooking. Cooked lentils often require thinning: adding more hot water or broth to the cooked legumes until the desired final consistency is reached. 
 
 Lentils can be sprouted as can some [[bean]]s and some other [[edible]] [[seed]]s (seeds people can eat).  Seeds being sprouted are watered and rinsed repeatedly till they start to [[germination|germinate]] (grow small roots and shoots).  Sprouted lentils can be eaten raw on their own or in [[salad]]s, they can also be cooked. < ref > [http://www.theleangreenbean.com/how-to-sprout-lentils/ How To Sprout Lentils] [http://www.vegetariantimes.com/blog/how-to-soak-and-sprout-nuts-seeds-grains-and-beans/ How to Sprout Nuts, Seeds, Grains, and Beans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316233936/http://www.vegetariantimes.com/blog/how-to-soak-and-sprout-nuts-seeds-grains-and-beans/ |date=2015-03-16 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Nutritional value == 
 
 Apart from a high level of proteins, lentils also contain [[dietary fiber]], [[vitamin B1]], and minerals. Red (or pink) lentils contain a lower concentration of fiber than green lentils (11% rather than 31%). < ref > {{Cite web |title=USDA nutrient database |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ |access-date=2008-09-11 |archive-date=2015-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303184216/http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  [[Health magazine|''Health'' magazine]] has selected lentils as one of the five healthiest foods. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.health.com/health/article/0,23414,1149140,00.html |title= World's Healthiest Foods: Lentils (India) |first= Joan |last= Raymond |date= March 2006 |work= Health Magazine |access-date= 2008-09-11 |archive-date= 2008-03-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080320132301/http://www.health.com/health/article/0,23414,1149140,00.html |url-status= dead }} < /ref >  Lentils are often mixed with grains, such as rice, which results in a [[complete protein]] dish. 
 
 In addition to providing slow-burning complex [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]], lentils are one of the best vegetable sources of [[Human iron metabolism|iron]]. This makes them an important part of a vegetarian diet, and useful for preventing [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]]. Iron is particularly important for [[Adolescence|adolescents]], and [[Menstruation|menstruating]] or [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] women. < ref > {{Citation| title=Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) |publisher=Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies |year=2004}} < /ref > 
 
 == Production == 
 Lentils are relatively tolerant to [[drought]] and are grown throughout the world. About half of the worldwide production of lentils is from [[India]], most of which is consumed locally [[Canada]] is the largest export producer of lentils in the world and [[Saskatchewan]] is the most important producing region in Canada.  The [[Palouse]] Region of Eastern Washington and the Idaho Panhandle, with its commercial center at [[Moscow, Idaho]], is the most important producing region in the United States. < ref > {{Citation| title=Crop Profile for Lentils in Idaho |publisher=Department of Plant, Soil and Entomological Science, University of Idaho (web site) |year=2000}} < /ref >  The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]  estimates that world production of lentils was 3.2 million metric tons (MT) in 2003. Canada produced 520,000 MT and, according to the market analysis company STAT Communications, will likely export 400,000 MT during the 2003-04 marketing year, which runs from August to July. The FAO estimates world trade in lentils totalled 1.2 million MT in 2002, with Canada exporting 382,000 MT during the calendar year. 
 
 === Lentils in Culture === 
 Lentils are mentioned many times in the [[Old Testament]]. In Jewish tradition they are considered as food for mourners, together with boiled [[egg (food)|egg]]s. The reason is that their round shape symbolizes the [[life cycle]] from birth to death.
