[[Ahaseurus]] was a [[King]] of [[Persia]] from the [[Book of Esther]].  He is normally identified with [[Xerxes I]] in modern [[translation]]s but it is actually [[debate]]d which [[king]] he was with older traditions saying that he was [[Artaxerxes I]].

 ==Role in the Book of Esther== 
 Ahaseurus asks for his [[wife]] [[Queen]] [[Vashti]] to come to his [[feast]] with her [[crown]] on but she refuses so Ahaseurus’s advisor Memuchan tells him to make a [[law]] that every [[man]] is his [[wife]]s master and that he get rid of Vashti. Ahaseurus does but he wants to get a new [[wife]] and ends up marrying [[Esther]] She opts not to disclose to him that she is. [[Jew]]ish because [[Mordechai]] told her it would be [[danger]]out if anyone knew. Esther then warned Ahaseurus that his [[servant]]s Bigtan and Teresh were trying to [[poison]] him so Ahaseurus had them [[execute]]d. Esther told Ahaseurus that Mordechai was the one who told her about the plan.  Ahaseurus made [[Haman]] his advisor and gave him the [[power]] to make his own laws as if he were the [[king]]. When Esther came to Ahaseurus without an [[invitation]], a [[crime]] [[punish]]able by [[death]], Ahaseurus let her and gave her the [[feast]] she asked for with Haman there too. Then Ahaseurus remembered that he did [[nothing]] to [[reward]] Mordechai for saving him so he had Haman take him on a [[horse]] across the [[city]] saying “this shall be done for the man whom the king wishes to [[honour]]”. At the second feast, Esther told Ahaseurus that she was a [[Jew]] and that Haman wanted to [[kill]] her and her people.  While Ahaseurus’s [[servant]] Charbonnah told Ahaseurus that Haman was planning to kill Mordechai. So Ahaseurus had [[Haman]] [[hanged]] on the [[gallows]] Haman had built to kill Mordechai and gave Mordechai Haman’s [[job]]. Moredechai and Esther asked Ahaseurus to cancel the law Haman had made and Ahaseurus told them that he couldn’t so he instead gave Mordechai the same power he had given Haman so Mordechai could give the Jews the right of [[self-defence]] so that they could use [[violence]] to [[fight]] back against and [[kill]] their [[enemies]] on the day Haman had chosen for the Jews to die. So after the Jews won, the Jews started to celebrate their victory with a [[holiday]] called [[Purim]].
