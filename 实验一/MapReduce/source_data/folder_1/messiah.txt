{{for|the oratorio by Handel|Messiah (Handel)}} 
 '''Messiah''' or  '''the Anointed One''' is the figure promised by [[God]] to the [[Judaism|Jews]] for the [[salvation]] of the world.  
 
 Other people in real life or [[fiction]] are called messianic if they have the [[quality|qualities]] of a messiah, or people think they will bring about a better world. 
 
 ==The How, Where, and Why== 
 * '''Why''': Jews believe the biblical [[prophet]]s inspired by God to tell of his coming. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah%2011:1-9; & version=9; |title=Isaiah 11:1-9 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |format= }} < /ref >  During the period of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule in [[1st century BC]] the idea of the messiah became very important in Jewish thought and teaching. According to the scriptures, the messiah would rescue the people from the Romans and restore the [[country]]. 
 * '''How''': There are many of ideas about how the messiah will come: [[Judge]], [[warrior]], [[beggar]], [[academic]], [[Philosopher]], [[healing|healer]] or a common person. 
 
 ==Jesus as the Messiah== 
 [[Christianity]], which began in Israel with Jewish followers of [[Jesus]] ({{lang-he|ישוע|Yeshua}}), holds that the Messiah foretold by the Jewish Scriptures is Jesus, and that in fulfillment of prophecy Jesus died for the sins of the world, rose from the dead and lives today, seated at the right hand of God until His return. Most Jews do not hold these beliefs; those who do are sometimes called [[Messianic Jew]]s.  Some Messianic Jews and other Christians see the fact that a majority of Jews do not hold these beliefs as a fulfillment of prophecy. (see [[Epistle to the Romans]] chapter 10) 
 
 [[Muslims]] believe that [[Jesus]] was the son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], that he was a mighty [[prophet]] of God and that he was the Messiah (though, in Islam, the Messiah has a different role than he does in Christianity or Judaism). They believe that he will come again one day in his [[Second Coming]] to fight besides the [[Mahdi]] against the ''[[Dajjal]]'' ( " false messiah " ).
