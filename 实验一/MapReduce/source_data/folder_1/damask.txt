 ==History== 
 Damask was first made using the five original weaving methods during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was common in the [[Byzantine Empire]], < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.cnch.org/cnchnet/winter-2011/damask-and-drawlooms/|title=A Short History of Damask and Drawlooms|publisher=}} < /ref >  and in [[Islamic]] areas. Its name comes from the city of [[Damascus]], where the pattern and the manufacturing technique were invented. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ww1.funmozar.com/|title=funmozar.com - Informationen zum Thema funmozar.|website=ww1.funmozar.com}} < /ref >  Damask lost popularity after the ninth century, except in [[Andalusia]]. It was revived by European weaving manufacturers, who got interested in oriental patterns and models. They made it on weaving looms from the 14th century onwards. < ref > Monnas, Lisa. 2008.

It is woven in [[silk]], [[linen]] and even [[synthetic fabric|synthetic]] materials. The patterns can represent plants, flowers and fruits, but also other classical Arabian designs. The unique characteristic of the pattern is that the light reflects differently, when watched from different angles.
