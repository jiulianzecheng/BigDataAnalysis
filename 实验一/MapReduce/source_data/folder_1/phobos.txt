{{for|the [[Satellite (natural)|moon]] of [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]|Phobos (moon)}} 
 
 '''Phobos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for  " fear " , is the root word of ''[[phobia]]'') is one of the sons of [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]] in [[Greek mythology]] and the twin brother of [[Deimos]]. He is known as the god of [[fear]], panic, flight and battlefield rout. He went with his father into battle, driving his [[chariot]] and spreading fear in his path. As a son of Aphrodite, goddess of love, each twin also represented the fear of loss. 
 
 The larger and innermost of [[Mars]]' two [[satellite (natural)|moons]] was named after him, and the other was named after Deimos.
