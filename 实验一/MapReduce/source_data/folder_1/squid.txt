 '''Squid''' are [[cephalopod]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Teuthida'''. They are the sister group to the [[octopod]]s. Squid are carnivores, but they are also hunted as prey. The largest squid, the [[giant squid]] and [[colossal squid]], are eaten by [[sperm whale]]s and [[sleeper shark]]s. < ref name=O'Shea >  O'Shea S. 2003. Giant squid and colossal squid fact sheet.

 There are about 300 [[species]] of squid. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 Squid, like [[cuttlefish]], have eight [[arm]]s arranged in pairs, and two longer [[tentacles]] with suckers. 
 
 All squid have a mouth with a [[radula]], and jet propulsion with the [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphon]] from the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]]. The radulla is a scraping [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] in the mouth that scrapes nutrients from food sources.  
 
 Tentacles are used for locomotive power and capturing food sources. All squids are [[carnivore]]s; they eat other animals, not [[plant]]s.  
 
 Like other cephalopoda, squid are intelligent animals. Squids have a head-like structure, with [[sense organ]]s and brains in the front end. Although the squids lack exterior shells they have a [[vestigial]] shell inside, made of [[chitin]]. 
 
 The skin is covered in [[chromatophore]]s, which enable the squid to change colour to suit its surroundings, making it effectively [[camouflage]]d. Controlled by the [[nervous system]], the camouflage can change in 'real time'.   
 
 == Locomotion == 
 Squids mainly rely on moving via jet propulsion, though deep sea squids may use their fins instead to save energy. A squid sucks in water through its [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]], than pushing it out through its [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphon]]. Squids also have their [[Gill|gills]] inside the mantle to collect oxygen while moving. 
 
 == Squid reproduction == 
 After a male and female mate, the [[female]] squid lays [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. The eggs are laid inside an egg case. Since the squid is usually a part of a [[Shoaling and schooling|shoal]], it is laid with many other egg cases from many other squids, and then [[anchor]]ed to the sea floor. Because of this, squid eggs are often (many times) found in [[wikt:clump|clumps]], and those clumps often look like a [[flower]]. 
 
 Often, the male will die a short time after mating, and the female will die once she has released her eggs. Because of this, squids usually lay eggs only once. Squids do not live very long. Although there are some long-lived species, most squids live for only one or two years. 
 
 ===Size===

 Most squid are no more than {{convert|60|cm|in}} long, although the [[giant squid]] may reach {{convert|13|m|ft}}. < ref name=O'Shea/ > 
 
 In 1978, sharp, curved claws on the suction cups of squid tentacles cut up the rubber coating on the hull of the [[USS Stein (FF-1065)|USS ''Stein'']]. The size suggested the largest squid known at the time. < ref name= " proceedings " > Johnson, C. Scott 1978. Sea creatures and the problem of equipment damage.

 Giant squid are featured in literature and folklore with a frightening connotation. The [[Kraken]] is a legendary tentacled monster possibly based on sightings of real giant squid.
