 A '''mascot''' is any [[person]], [[animal]], or [[object]] thought to bring [[luck]], or anything used to [[Symbol|symbolize]] a group. Many schools and sports [[teams]] have a mascot, and so do some [[corporation]]s or products. For example, the mascot of the [[Sacramento Kings]] is a lion, and the mascot of [[Geico]] is a [[gecko]].   
 
 Mascots can be used as spokespeople in [[advertising]] for products. They are also used in [[merchandise]], which can be any kind of product that features the brand or can represent the mascot itself.
