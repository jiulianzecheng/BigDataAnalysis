 The [[insect]] [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Mantophasmatidae''' is the sole family in its [[Order (biology)|order]]. It is a group of African carnivorous insects discovered in 2002. < ref > {{cite book |title= Essentials of conservation biology|url= https://archive.org/details/essentialsofcons0000prim_r2u2|edition=4th|page=[https://archive.org/details/essentialsofcons0000prim_r2u2/page/62 62]|last=Primack|first=Richard B.|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc|year=2006|isbn=978-0-87893-720-2}} < /ref >  The most common vernacular name for this order is '''gladiators''', but it is not well known under any name.  
 
 Their modern centre of [[endemism]] is western [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]], although a relict population and [[Eocene]] fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution. 
 
 Members of the order are wingless even as [[adult]]s, making them relatively difficult to identify. They resemble a mix between [[Mantis|praying mantids]] and [[phasmid]]s. Molecular evidence indicates that they are most closely related to a family known as the [[Grylloblattidae]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author= Cameron S.L; Barker S.C.  &  Whiting M.F. |year=2006 |title=Mitochondrial genomics and the new insect order Mantophasmatodea |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=38 |pages=274–279 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.09.020 |pmid=16321547 |issue=1}} < /ref > 
 
 The mantophasmids were originally described from old museum specimens that found in Namibia (''Mantophasma zephyra'') and Tanzania (''M. subsolana''), and from a 45-million-year-old specimen of [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] [[amber]] (''Raptophasma kerneggeri''). 
 
 The most recent classification recognizes numerous genera, including fossils. < ref > Arill, A.  &  M. Engel 2006. Rock crawlers in Baltic amber (Notoptera: Mantophasmatodea).
