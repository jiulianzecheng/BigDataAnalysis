 '''''Deinotherium''''' was a large [[proboscidea]]n related to modern [[elephant]]s. Their downward curving tusks are notable. They are known from the middle [[Miocene]] to the early [[Pleistocene]]. ''Dinotherium'' is put in its own family (the Deinotheriidae) in the Proboscidea.  
 
 There were several species of ''Deinotherium'' that lived in parts of [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. The ''Deinotherium'' was larger than today’s elephants. 
 
 The way ''Deinotherium'' used its curious tusks has been much debated. It may have rooted in soil for underground plant parts like roots and [[tuber]]s, pulled down branches to snap them and reach leaves, or stripped soft bark from tree trunks. < ref > Harris J.M. 1976.

 It helps to remember that the Miocene was much warner and wetter than today, and that the Africa of the Miocene had rather different fauna from today. ''Deinotherium'' was a creature of muddy tropical rivers and forests, not the dry savannahs of today. It also lived in southern [[Europe]] and east to the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian Subcontinent]]. 
 
 Deinotherium fossils have been uncovered at several of the African sites where remains of prehistoric [[hominid]] relatives of modern humans have also been found.
