 '''Prayer''' is a [[worship]] and communication to God.  Prayer can be spoken, silent (no talking), or in a [[song]].  It can be used to praise God or to ask for something including help and [[forgiveness]].  
 
 Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set ritual or an individual invocation and can take the form of a hymn, a ritual statement, or a spontaneous expression. It can be done alone or in groups.  
 
 In Christianity, prayers are varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. The most common prayer among Christians is the [[Lord's Prayer]], which according to the gospel accounts is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray. 
 
 Islamic prayer, or [[salat]] is a duty to be performed five times per day.   
 
 [[Hinduism]] has prayer to various divinities or holy beings.
