 '''Aryan''' is the name that an ancient people speaking Indo-Iranian languages gave to themselves. [[wikt:simple:offspring|Descendants]] of the Aryans include speakers of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Avestan language|Avestan]] which are related to the [[Indo-European languages]]. Ancient Persians and Vedic peoples used the name ''Aryan'' to mean [[noble]]s. The name  " Iran "  itself means the ''Land of the Aryans''. 
 
 The [[Avestan]] name ''[[Airyanem Vaejah|Airiianəm vaēǰō]]''  " Aryan expanse " , is a reference in the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]] ([[Vendidad]], Fargard 1) to the Aryans’ mother country and one of [[Ahura Mazda]]'s  " sixteen perfect lands " . < ref > Encyclopedia Iranica, ĒRĀN-WĒZ < /ref >  Other Avestan names are ''airyō.šayana'', the “Aryan people”, and ''airyā daiŋˊhāvā'' “the Aryan lands”. < ref > Encyclopedia Iranica, AVESTAN GEOGRAPHY. < /ref >  These names were known to old [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] writers as ''[[Ariana]]''. < ref > Encyclopedia Iranica, ARIA (2. Ariane) < /ref >  Also the [[Sanskrit]] name ''[[Aryavarta]]''  " abode of the Aryans " , was a region in north of today's [[India]]. < ref > Dictionary of Greek and Roman geography, William Smith, 1870, pp. & nbsp;210, Aria'na < /ref >  The [[Middle Persian]] name of the [[Sassanians|Sassanian Empire]], an [[empire]] that ruled [[Persia]] from the [[3rd century]] to the [[7th century]], was ''Eran-shar'' meaning the ''Aryan Empire''. < ref > Wiesehofer, Joseph   ''Ancient Persia'' New York:1996 I.B. Tauris < /ref >   Today, the name ''Iran'' is simply the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for ''Aryan''. 
 
 Sanskrit is the oldest written language of the Indo-European family of languages.  The [[Vedas]] are composed in this language. Some portions of the [[Rigveda]] are thought to be the oldest writing in any Indo-European language. 
 
 ==Aryan equated with Indo-European== 
 
 In the late [[18th century]], [[Europe]]ans began using the term  ''Aryan'' to refer to the original [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] and their descendents up to the present day (i.e., the [[Indo-European people#Indo-European peoples|Indo-European peoples]]—those [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]s who are speakers of the [[Indo-European languages]]). This was the most common definition of ''Aryan'' in the [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]]. < ref > Wells, H.G. ''The Outline of History'' New York:1920 Doubleday  &  Co. Chapter 19 The Aryan Speaking Peoples in Pre-Historic Times Pages 271-285 < /ref > 
 
 == Nazism == 
 
 In the late [[19th century]], some [[Europe]]ans began to use the name ''Aryan'' for only the [[Germanic peoples|Nordic]] peoples of Europe (one branch of the Indo-European peoples), as a  " pure, "   " noble "  and  " superior "  race they claimed were descended from the original Aryans. 
 
 The [[theory]] that the Aryans first came from Europe became especially accepted in [[Germany]]. It was widely believed that the  " [[Vedic]] Aryans "  were the same people as the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]] and other ancient Germanic peoples who brought the Western [[Roman Empire]] to an end. This idea was often mixed with [[anti-Semitic]] ideas. The [[Master Race]] theory became a main idea for [[Nazism|Nazis]]. After the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, these ideas led to horrible persecutions of the [[Jews]] which culminated in [[the Holocaust]]. 
 
 ==Modern view== 
 
 The idea of [[racism]] that the Nazi theory means has been totally put aside by modern scientists, some of whom also disagree with the idea that the original Aryans ever lived in Europe. Most other scientists do maintain that the original [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] did live about 5,000 years ago in the area in Europe east of [[Ukraine]] and north of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and that the original Aryans (the ''[[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]s'' or eastern branch of the Indo-European peoples) did migrate east to Iran and India from there, and the original ancestors of the modern ''European peoples'' (the western or ''European'' branch of the Indo-European peoples) did migrate west from there. This is called the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].
