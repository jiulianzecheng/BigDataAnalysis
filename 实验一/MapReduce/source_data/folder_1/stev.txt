 ==The different types of stev== 
 
 There are different types of stev: 
 * [[gamle-stev]] or  " gamlestev "  is the oldest type. It is likely that gamle-stev were [[dance]]d.  < ref group=ref > [[Dagne Groven Myhren]], ''Stev'', Cappelens Musikkleksikon 1980, Cappelen, Column no.3(paragraph no.4),[[ISBN]] 82-02-03689-5 < /ref >  The earliest gamle-stev have been found from around the end of the 1200's. Most gamle-stevs are from [[Setesdal]] and [[Vest-Telemark]]. Some gamle-stev may be part of [[Folk music|folk songs]]. The gamle-stev is the only part of the folk song which was passed down from [[generation]] to generation. The rest of the folk song is no longer known. 
 * [[ny-stev]] or  " nystev "  have probably been around since about year 1700. Most ny-stevs have been replaced by [[rural]] folksongs in [[Telemark]], but not in [[Setesdal]]. 
 * [[om-kved]] or  " omkved "  are similar to [[refrain]]s in [[ballads]]. [[Inn-stev]], < ref > " inn-stev "  can also be spelled  " innstev " < /ref >  [[etter-stev]], < ref > " etter-stev "  can also be spelled  " etterstev " < /ref >  [[mellom-sleng]]  < ref > " mellom-sleng "  can also be spelled  " mellomsleng " < /ref >  and [[etter-sleng]]  < ref > " etter-sleng "  can also be spelled  " ettersleng " < /ref >  are different types of om-kved. 
 * [[slåtte-stev]] or  " slåttestev "  are [[instrumental]] dance songs. 
 * [[herme-stev]] or hermestev are often referred to as  " [[parody]]-[[quote]] "  stev. The contain [[apologetic proverb]]s (also known as [[Apologetic proverb|Wellerisms]]). 
 
 ==The people who can perform stev== 
 
 A person who can [[performance|perform]] a stev, is known as a [[kveder]] (a type of [[artist]]). [[Aslak Brekke]] is possibly the most well known of those who have been [[Sound recording|recorded]]. A kveder from Setesdal, when performing stev, usually [[sing]]s more slowly, than a kveder from Telemark. < ref group=ref name=ex03 > Dagne Groven Myhren, ''Stev'' S.V.,Cappelens Musikkleksikon 1981, Cappelen, 1981, Column no.5 
 < /ref >  One reason for this may be that the [[text]] of Setesdal stev are usually more [[meditation|meditative]] (or [[elegiac]]). < ref group=ref name=ex03/ >
