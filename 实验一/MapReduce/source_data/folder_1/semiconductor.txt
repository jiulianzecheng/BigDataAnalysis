 A '''semiconductor''' is a [[material]] that in some cases will [[Conduction|conduct]] [[electricity]] but not in others. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/semiconductor|title=What is semiconductor? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=WhatIs.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}} < /ref >  Good [[electrical conductor]]s, like [[copper]] or [[silver]], easily allow electricity to flow through them. < ref name=Turley4 > James L. Turley, ''The Essential Guide to Semiconductors'' (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall Professional Technical Reference, 2003), p. 4 < /ref >  Materials that block the flow of electricity, like [[rubber]] or [[plastic]], are called [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. < ref name=Turley4/ >  Insulators are often used to protect people from [[electric shock]]. As the name [[wikt:imply|implies]], a semiconductor does not conduct as well as a conductor. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/comp/conduct/conduct.htm |title=Conductors and Semiconductors |author= |website= |publisher=University of St. Andrews |accessdate=31 October 2016}} < /ref >  [[Silicon]] is the most used semiconductor, but [[gallium arsenide]] is also used. 
 
 By the addition of different atoms into the crystal lattice (grid) of the semiconductor it changes its conductivity by making [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] and [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] semiconductors. [[Silicon]] is the most important commercial semiconductor, though many others are used. They can be made into [[transistor]]s, which are small amplifiers. Transistors are used in computers, mobile phones, digital audio players and many other electronic devices. 
 
 Like other solids, the electrons in semiconductors can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of energy levels) between the energy of the ground state, corresponding to electrons tightly bound to the [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] of the material, and the free electron energy, which is the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. 
 
 == History == 
 Semiconductors were being studied in [[Laboratory|laboratories]] as early as the 1830s. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_spring2005.web.dir/george_walker/history.htm|title=Semiconductors|work=uaf.edu|accessdate=15 May 2015}} < /ref >  In 1833 [[Michael Faraday]] was [[experiment]]ing with [[silver sulfide]]. < ref name=CHM > {{cite web |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1833-first.html |title=1833 - First Semiconductor Effect is Recorded |author= |website= |publisher=Computer History Museum |accessdate=15 May 2015}} < /ref >  He discovered that as the material was heated it conducted electricity better. This was the opposite of how copper acted. When copper is heated it conducts less electricity. A number of other early experimenters discovered other properties of semiconductors. In 1947 at [[Bell Labs]] in [[New Jersey]], the [[transistor]] was invented. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.semiwiki.com/forum/content/1574-brief-history-semiconductors.html |title=A Brief History of Semiconductors |author=Paul McLellan |date=25 October 2012 |website= |publisher=SemiWiki.com |accessdate=15 May 2015}} < /ref >  This led to the development of [[integrated circuit]]s, which power almost all electronic devices today.

 == Doping == 
 [[Doping (semiconductor)|Doping]] is the process of adding a small [[impurity]] to a pure semiconductor to change its electrical properties. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.boundless.com/chemistry/textbooks/boundless-chemistry-textbook/liquids-and-solids-11/crystals-and-band-theory-88/doping-connectivity-of-semiconductors-387-3513/ |title=Doping: Connectivity of Semiconductors |author= |website= |publisher=Boundless |accessdate=15 May 2015 |archive-date=20 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920062632/https://www.boundless.com/chemistry/textbooks/boundless-chemistry-textbook/liquids-and-solids-11/crystals-and-band-theory-88/doping-connectivity-of-semiconductors-387-3513/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Lightly and moderately doped semiconductors are called '''extrinsic'''. A semiconductor doped to such high levels that it acts more like a conductor than a semiconductor is referred to as '''degenerate'''. Most semiconductors are made out of silicon crystals. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/electronics-basics-what-is-a-semiconductor.html |title=Electronics Basics: What Is a Semiconductor? |author=Doug Lowe |website= |publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons, Inc. |accessdate=16 May 2015}} < /ref >  Pure silicon has little use but doped silicon is the basis for most semiconductors. [[Silicon Valley]] was named for the large number of semiconductor startup companies that were located there. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://venturebeat.com/2014/12/13/silicon-catalyst-aims-to-incubate-silicon-valley-semiconductor-startups/|title=Silicon Catalyst aims to incubate Silicon Valley semiconductor startups |author= |website= |date=13 December 2014 |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=16 May 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Semiconductors today== 
 Today, semiconductors are used far and wide. Semiconductors can be found in nearly every electronic device. Desktop computers, the Internet, tablet devices, smartphones all would not be possible without semiconductors. 
 Semiconductors can be made into very precise switches with a small amount of voltage. The voltage that the semiconductor doesnâ€™t need can be sent to other electrical components in the device. Semiconductors can also be made very tiny and many of them can fit into a rather small circuit. Since they can be made so small, electrical devices today can be made thin and lightweight without compromising processing power. 
 Some of the dominating companies in the semiconductor business are [[Intel Corporation]], [[Samsung|Samsung Electronics]], [[TSMC]], [[Qualcomm]] and Micron Technology. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/top-20-semiconductor-companies-2014-2014-11/ |title=Top 20 semiconductor companies 2014 |author= |website= |date=7 November 2014 |publisher=Electronics Weekly/Metropolis Media Publishing |accessdate=12 August 2015}} < /ref >
