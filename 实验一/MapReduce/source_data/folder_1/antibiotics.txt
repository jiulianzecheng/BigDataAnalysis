 An '''antibiotic''' (or '''antibacterial''') is a chemical compound that [[kill]]s [[bacteria]] or slows their [[growth]]. They are used as [[medicine]] to treat and [[:wikt:cure|cure]] [[disease]]s caused by bacteria. The first antibiotic discovered was [[Penicillin]], a natural antibiotic produced by a [[fungus]]. Production of antibiotics first began in 1939, and in the modern day, they are made by [[chemical synthesis]]. Antibiotics can not be used to treat [[virus]]es. 
 
 [[Maclyn McCarty]] explained what it was like before antibiotics: 
 
 :  " There are a number of infections from which no-one had [ever] recovered before the discovery of effective anti-bacterial agents " . < ref > McCarty M. 1985. ''The transforming principle: discovering that genes are made of DNA''. New York: W.W. Norton, p40. {{ISBN|0-393-30450-7}} < /ref > 
 
 == Resistance == 
 {{main|antibiotic resistance}} 
 Today, people worry that [[bacteria]] will not be affected by antibiotics. Bacteria do [[evolve]], and already many strains of bacteria resist regular antibiotics. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.abpischools.org.uk/page/modules/infectiousdiseases_medicines/medicines3.cfm?coSiteNavigation_allTopic=1 |title=Antibiotic resistance - ABPI - Resources for Schools |access-date=2013-03-11 |archive-date=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125023447/http://www.abpischools.org.uk/page/modules/infectiousdiseases_medicines/medicines3.cfm?coSiteNavigation_allTopic=1 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  When exposed to antibiotics, most bacteria die quickly, but some may have [[mutations]] which make them slightly less susceptible. These bacteria then multiply and make a large colony which is less affected by the antibiotic. 
 
 Part of this problem is caused by the over-use and misuse of antibiotics. If someone is sick with a virus, antibiotics will not affect the virus. Some doctors will still prescribe an antibiotic so the patient feels as though they are being treated for their illness. 
 
 The other problem is that many people do not use antibiotics correctly. People often stop taking the medicine when they start feeling better. But antibiotics don't kill all of the bad bacteria at once. Bacteria which are more [[resistance to antibiotics|resistant]] do not die right away. When someone stops taking the antibiotic too quickly, these resistant bacteria can reproduce and survive. Then the antibiotic does not work so well because the bacteria are less affected by it. 
 
 ==  History== 
 Antibiotics can be the most effective way of treating bacterial infections. A clue to this might been found in [[Pasteur]]'s work. He had a culture of [[anthrax]] germs that were left exposed to air. They developed colonies of many fungi, but the anthrax [[bacilli]] disappeared. Medical science was not, at the time, ready to see the implication of this. 
 
 [[File:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|170px|[[Penicillin]], the first natural antibiotic discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928.]] 
 
 It was 1928 that the study of antibiotics started,a small chance beginning. [[Alexander Fleming]], a London [[bacteriologist]], was culturing ''[[staphylococcus]]''. In one [[Petri dish]] a [[mould]] appeared and spread On the nutrient [[gelatin]] of the dish each patch of mould was surrounded by clear ring, free of bacteria. Moreover, the extracted substance was able to clear up infected [[wound]]s. 
 
 The term ''antibiotic'' was first used in 1942 by [[Selman Waksman]] and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is [[wikt:antagonism|antagonistic]] to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution. < ref name= " Wakeman1947 " > Waksman S.A. 1947. What is an antibiotic or an antibiotic substance?. ''Mycologia'' '''39''' (5): 565–569. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3755196?uid=3738032 & uid=2 & uid=4 & sid=21101809445701] < /ref >  This definition cut out substances which kill bacteria, but are not produced by microorganisms (such as [[gastric juice]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]]). It also excluded [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial compounds such as the [[Sulfonamide (drug)|sulfonamides]]. 
 
 With advances in [[medicinal chemistry]], most of today's antibacterials chemically are modifications of various natural compounds. < ref > {{cite journal |author=von Nussbaum F. | display-authors = etal |title=Medicinal Chemistry of Antibacterial Natural Products – Exodus or Revival?|journal=Angew.

 == Use == 
 Certain bacteria are only affected by specific types of antibiotics. Antibiotics fight infection caused by bacteria. Patients might need different types or different amounts of antibiotics depending on what bacteria is causing their health problems. Because of this, antibiotics should always be used under the supervision of a medical doctor (or other certified medical practitioner). The doctor can also watch for side effects and change the patient's treatment when necessary. Antibiotics are very useful when your body is infected by a bacteria. 
 Antibiotics don't kill virus, so it is useless against a viral infection. A doctor must determine if a patient's infection is of viral or bacterial origin before taking antibiotics, this is another reason why a medical doctor should prescribe antibiotics instead of relying on self-medication.

 Teixobactin is the first new antibiotic discovered in forty years. It is active against [[gram-positive]] bacteria, including ''Staphylococcus aureus''. It appears to be one of a new class of antibiotics. < ref > Gallagher, James 2015. Antibiotics: US discovery labelled 'game-changer' for medicine. ''BBC News'' Health.
