 The '''Gorgonopsids'''  < ref > meaning  " Gorgon arch, "  [[Gorgon]] was a beast in Greek mythology whose gaze could turn you to stone, and arch refers to synapsid skull holes < /ref >  were [[Therapsid]]s, a group of [[tetrapods]] which eventually gave rise to the [[mammals]]. Gorgonopsids had fur and layed eggs. 
 
 Gorgonopsids were a successful group which lived during the [[Permian|Permian period]], about 260 million years ago. They became [[extinct]] in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]].  
 
 They were the major predators of their day. They had large, powerful, square-shaped jaws with huge, sabre-like canine and interlaced, socket-like teeth. Many fossils have been found in [[South Africa]]. 
 
 The largest known, ''[[Inostrancevia]]'', was the size of a large bear with a 45 & nbsp;cm long skull, and 12-cm long [[sabre]]-like teeth.   
 
 The '''Gorgonopsidae''' are divided into three sub-families:  
 *Rubidginae, which had large, broad skulls, 
 *Gorgonopsinae, which included most of the gorgonopsid [[genera]]. 
 *Inostranceviinae
