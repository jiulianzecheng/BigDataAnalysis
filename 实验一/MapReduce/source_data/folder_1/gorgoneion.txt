 In [[Ancient Greece]], the '''Gorgoneion''' ({{lang-el|Γοργόνειον}}) was originally a [[magic]] [[pendant]] showing the [[Gorgon]]'s head. < ref name= " vassilika " > {{harvnb|Vassilika|1998|p=20}}. < /ref >  (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called [[Apotropaism]]).  
 The gorgoneion was linked with the gods [[Zeus]] and [[Athena]]; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. < ref name= " vassilika " / >  It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on [[shield]]s and [[cape]]s. These can be seen on the [[Alexander Mosaic]] and the [[Gonzaga Cameo]]. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 [[Homer]] wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. < ref name= " potts " / >  [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] notes that  " Medusa is a head and nothing more...a [[mask]]. " < ref name= " prolegomena " > {{harvnb|Harrison|1991|pp=187-188}}. < /ref >  The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her [[tongue]] sticking out, [[boar]] [[tusk]]s, puffy cheeks, her [[eyeball]]s staring straight ahead and the [[snake]]s twisting all around her. 
 
 The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. < ref > {{harvnb|Ogden|2008|p=35}} < /ref >  In some cases a [[beard]], (probably representing streaks of [[blood]]) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like [[Dionysus]]. 
 
 Gorgoneia painted on the [[shield]]s of [[warrior]]s on mid-5th century Greek [[vase]]s are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. < ref name= " potts " / >  The [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] marble known as the [[Medusa Rondanini]] shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman. < ref name= " potts " / >

 Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig at [[Parium]]. < ref name= " potts " > {{harvnb|Potts|1982|pp=26-28}}. < /ref >  Other early 8th-century examples were found at [[Tiryns]]. There is a similar image from the [[Knossos]] [[palace]], dating from the 15th century BC. [[Marija Gimbutas]] even argues that  " the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a [[ceramic]] mask from the [[Sesklo culture]] illustrates " . < ref > {{harvnb|Gimbutas|2001|p=25}}. < /ref > 
 
 In the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of  " lion mask "  were found all over Greek [[temple]]s, especially in and around [[Corinth]]. [[Pediment]]al gorgoneia were common in [[Sicily]]; probably the earliest one is in the [[Temple of Apollo]] in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. < ref name= " marconi " > {{harvnb|Marconi|2007|pp=214-217}}. < /ref >  Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles ([[antefix]]) of smaller buildings throughout the next century. < ref name= " marconi " / > 
 
 As well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, [[weapon]]s, and coins across the [[Mediterranean]] region from [[Etruria]] to the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Gorgon [[coin]]s were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. < ref name= " potts " / >  On [[mosaic]] floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On [[Attica|Attic]] [[kiln]]s, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents. < ref > {{harvnb|Harrison|1991|p=189, figs. 27-30}}. < /ref > 
 
 The Gorgon image remained popular even in [[Christian]] times, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]], including [[Kievan Rus]] (now the [[Ukraine]]). The image was used in [[Western Europe]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artists. In the [[20th century]], the gorgoneion was used by [[Gianni Versace]] as a [[logo]] for his fashion company. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the [[Mother Goddess]] cult linked to  " dynamic life energy " . She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar [[ritual]] masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him. < ref name= " prolegomena " / >
