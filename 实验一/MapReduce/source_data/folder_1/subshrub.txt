A '''subshrub''' ([[Latin]] ''suffrutex'') is a [[wood]]y [[perennial plant]]. Gardeners use the word to distinguish plants from a [[shrub]] that have lower height, typically less than 10â€“20 & nbsp;cm tall, or that are only weakly woody and/or persist only for a few years. Small, low shrubs such as [[lavender]], [[Vinca|periwinkle]], and [[thyme]], and many members of the family [[Ericaceae]], such as [[cranberry|cranberries]], are often classed as subshrubs.
