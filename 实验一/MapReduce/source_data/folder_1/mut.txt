 '''Mut''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Deity|goddess]].  Mut meant ''mother'' in the ancient [[Egyptian language]]. < ref > Velde, Herman te (2002). Mut. In D. B. Redford (Ed.), The ancient gods speak: A guide to Egyptian religion (pp. 238). New York: Oxford University Press, USA. < /ref >  Her name can also be spelled '''Maut''' or '''Mout'''. She is associated with the waters from which everything was born. 
 
 Some of Mut's many titles included ''World-Mother'', ''[[Eye of Ra]]'', ''Queen of the Goddesses'', ''Lady of Heaven'', ''Mother of the Gods'', and ''She Who Gives Birth, But Was Herself Not Born of Any''. 
 
 In [[art]], Mut was pictured as a woman with the wings of a [[vulture]]. She holds an [[ankh]] and wears the united [[crown]] of Upper and Lower Egypt. Her dress is bright red or blue. There is a [[feather]] of the goddess [[Ma'at]] at her feet. 
 
 Mut is sometimes shown as a [[cobra]], a [[cat]], a [[cow]], or as a [[lion]]ess as well as the vulture.
