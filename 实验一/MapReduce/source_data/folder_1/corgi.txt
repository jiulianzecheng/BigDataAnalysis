 The '''corgi''' (or '''Welsh corgi''') is a small [[breed]] of [[dog]]. It comes from [[Wales]]. 
 
 There are two breeds: the Pembroke Welsh corgi and the Cardigan Welsh corgi. Queen [[Elizabeth II]] has kept pet Pembroke Welsh corgis since she was seven years old. < ref name=vf/ > 
 
 Corgis have a long torso and short legs, large bones, and a very short tail. Corgis were originally bred as dogs. They are very active and like exercise. They are intelligent and have good memories.

 Outside Wales, corgis have been made popular by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. She usually had at least four as pets and once as many as thirteen. < ref name=vf > {{cite news|author1=Michael Joseph Gross|title=Her Most Loyal Subjects|issue=660|publisher=Vanity Fair (magazine)|date=August 2015|pages=102–114}} < /ref >  Her first corgi was named Susan. She mated Susan and her current dogs are still [[offspring]] of that [[breed]]ing. < ref name=vf/ >  She now has two corgis who are about twelve years old. < ref name=vf/ >  Some [[portraits]] of Queen Elizabeth II show her holding a corgi or a few around her. < ref name= " Hausman " > {{cite book |last=Hausman |first= Gerald |title=The Mythology of Dogs |publisher=Macmillan |year=1998 |pages=275–277}} < /ref > < ref Name=vf/ >
