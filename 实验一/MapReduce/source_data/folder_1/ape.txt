 '''Apes''' are [[mammal]]s belonging to the [[primate]] family '''Hominoidea'''. Its members are called '''hominoids'''. They are native to [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Its living members are divided into two [[Family (biology)|families]]: 
 *[[Hylobatidae]], the [[gibbon]]s and [[siamang]]s. 
 *[[Hominidae]], consisting of [[human]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[bonobo]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[orangutan]]s. < ref name= " MSW3 " > Groves, Colin; Wilson D.E. and Reeder D.M. (eds) 2005.

 In everyday use,  " ape "  often refers only to hominoids other than humans. 
 
 One clear difference between [[monkey]]s and apes is that monkeys almost always have tails, but hominoids never do. There are also differences in their [[tooth|teeth]] and the way they move their [[arm]]s. They have a wide degree of freedom at the shoulder joint, which helps them swing by their arms in the trees ([[brachiation]]). 
 
 The diets of apes are similar to those of other [[primate]]s. They eat fruits, nuts, seeds, leaves and sometimes other animals. They are generally [[omnivore]]s, though most of their intake is primarily [[herbivorous]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14926-loving-bonobos-have-a-carnivorous-dark-side#.VHXsaclWqUU|title=Loving bonobos have a carnivorous dark side|first=Ewen|last=Ewen|date=13 October 2008|website=newscientist|access-date=6 May 2016|archive-date=12 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412232453/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14926-loving-bonobos-have-a-carnivorous-dark-side/#.VHXsaclWqUU|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/humans-are-becoming-more-carnivorous-1.14282|title=Humans are becoming more carnivorous|first=Hannah|last=Hoag|date=2013|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.14282|s2cid=183143537|access-date=6 May 2016|archive-date=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129232443/http://www.nature.com/news/humans-are-becoming-more-carnivorous-1.14282|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 [[File:Homininae.svg|center|frame|[[Tree of life (biology)|Evolutionary tree]] of the superfamily [[Hominoidea]]. It highlights the subfamily Homininae. First the gibbons ([[Hylobatidae]]) split from the main line some 18 million years ago. Next, the subfamily [[Ponginae]] broke away—leading to the current orangutan. Later the Homininae split into the tribe [[Hominini]] (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe [[Gorillini]]]]
