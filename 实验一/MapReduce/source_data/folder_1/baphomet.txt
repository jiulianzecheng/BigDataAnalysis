 '''Baphomet''' is a name of unestablished origin. It first appeared in trial transcripts during the [[inquisition]] of the [[Knights Templar]] in the early 1300s. Some modern scholars believe the name to have been an [[Old French]] corruption and misspelling of the name Mahomet ([[Muhammad]]). < ref > [[Malcolm Barber]], p. 321 < /ref >  Nowadays it is generally viewed as a symbol of [[the Devil]]. 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]], the Templar were accused of [[heresy]], such as denying [[Jesus Christ]] and spitting on the [[cross]]. They also supposedly worshiped an icon called  " Bafomet " . Beyond this, little is known about the origins of the Baphomet. 
 
 In the 1800s, [[magician]] [[Eliphas Levi]] interpreted Baphomet as an [[occult]] symbol representing perfection, or the union of opposites to create divine harmony. To illustrate his point, he depicted the entity as a goat-headed [[androgyne]] with wings, female breasts, a rod between its legs, and a flaming torch between its horns. 
 
 This imagery was soon used by people who thought it was Satanic- notably in anti-[[Freemasonry]] tracts, where some writers accused Masons of worshipping  the devil. Many [[evangelical]] [[Christian]]s still believe masonry to be of the devil. 
 
 In modern times, Baphomet has been adapted as a symbol by occultists and Satanists. A related symbol (also drawn by Levi) is the [[Sigil of Baphomet]], which is a goat's head drawn inside a five-pointed star. It has become a common icon among [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands like [[Slayer]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]]. The Sigil of Baphomet is also the official logo of the [[Church of Satan]].
