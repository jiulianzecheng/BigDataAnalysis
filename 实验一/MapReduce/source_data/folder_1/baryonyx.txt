 '''''Baryonyx''''' was a [[carnivorous]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] discovered in [[clay]] pits just south of [[Dorking]], [[England]], and also in northern [[Spain]]. It has been dated to the Barremian stage of the [[Lower Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], between 130 to 125 million years ago. 
 
 It was first discovered in 1983 by the amateur [[fossil]] hunter William Walker. A group of scientists lead by Alan Charig and Angela Milner of the [[Natural History Museum]] of [[London]] examined the skeleton and named the animal ''Baryonyx'' (meaning 'heavy claw'), and the [[species]] name ''walkeri'' after the man who discovered it. < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3970849 |jstor=3970849 |title=Fossil claw unearths a new family tree |journal=Science News |volume=130 |issue=23 |pages=356 |year=1986 |last1=Edwards |first1=D. D.}} < /ref >  Other good skeletons were discovered in England and in Spain, which gave scientists a good idea of what the dinosaur was like. 
 
 ''Baryonyx'' grew up to between {{convert|7.5|and|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and weighed 1.2 and 1.7 t (1.3 and 1.9 short tons). It had long arms which were probably used for holding on to prey, the claw on the first finger was 31 centimeters (12 & nbsp;in) long. It ate mostly [[fish]], like a [[grizzly bear]] would; for this it had a long snout like a [[gharial]], and straight, cone-like teeth perfect for fishing. It had a triangle-shaped crest on the top of its [[skull]]. < ref name= " Hunting " > {{cite book
