 == Types of plagiarism == 
 * Direct Plagiarism – copying and pasting someone else's work, or making minor changes to someone else's work to pass it off as their own. < ref name=typesBOW > {{cite web |url=https://www.bowdoin.edu/dean-of-students/conduct-review-board/academic-honesty-and-plagiarism/common-types-of-plagiarism.html |title=The Common Types of Plagiarism |author= |website= |publisher=Bowdoin College Brunswick, Maine |accessdate=4 November 2021}} < /ref >

 * Mosaic Plagiarism – Or  " patch writing, "  is when parts of other works are copied without using [[quotation mark]]s. It can also be when a student keeps the same structure and meaning of an original passage and only uses [[synonym]]s. < ref name=typesBOW/ > 
 * Accidental Plagiarism – This can happen when a student does not cite their sources. It can also happen when a student [[paraphrase]]s information without giving [[wikt:attribution|attribution]] (credit to the original author or authors). < ref name=typesBOW/ >

 }} < /ref >  Writers are as responsible for intentional plagiarism as they are for accidental plagiarism. < ref name=avoidHARVARD/ >  It is important to cite sources while doing [[research]]. Putting this off until later can cause some sources to be forgotten or incorrectly cited. < ref name=avoidHARVARD/ > 
 
 When using a source, make sure the content is in the same [[context]] as the paper. < ref name=avoidHARVARD/ >  Try to avoid using [[bias]]ed sources. < ref name=avoidHARVARD/ >  Always take the time to find the correct information about a source. < ref name=avoidHARVARD/ >  For example, some web pages may be part of a larger [[website]]. While a web page article may seem fair and balanced, it can be affected by the overall bias or reputation of the publisher. < ref name=avoidHARVARD/ >  Using something out of context can also lead to charges of plagiarism. < ref name=avoidHARVARD/ >  Taking the time to properly cite all sources in a paper or work is paying respect to the original ideas of others. < ref name=avoidplagNORTHWEST > {{cite web |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/policies/academic-integrity/how-to-avoid-plagiarism.html |title=Guidelines for Proper Attribution |author= |website=Office of the Provost |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=4 October 2016}} < /ref >  This is all part of doing good work.
