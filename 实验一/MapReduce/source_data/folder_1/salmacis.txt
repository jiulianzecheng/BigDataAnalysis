 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Salmacis''' was a [[Nymph|naiad nymph]] of a spring at Caria in [[Asia Minor]]. She didn't follow the other nymphs of the goddess [[Diana]] and united bodies with [[Hermaphroditus]] becoming a single being, both male and female.

 According to Ovid's myth, she fell in love with Hermaphroditus, the son of [[Hermes]] and [[Aphrodite]]. When he bathed in her spring, she embraced him and prayed to the gods to be united with him forever, the gods heard her prayer and merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an [[hermaphrodite|androgynous]] being. Hermaphroditus then cursed the spring of Salmacis, so that any man who drank or bathed in its water would also become androgynous.
