 '''Nakseongdae''' is a park in Gwanak, [[Seoul]]. It is the birthplace of the famous [[Goryeo]]-Era [[General officer|general]], [[Gang Gam-chan]] (강감찬, 姜邯贊 ; 948-1031). [[Legend]] says that when Gang Gam-chan was born, a [[star]] fell from [[Heaven]].  Because of this, his birthplace was named  " Site of the Falling Star "  (Nakseongdae). 
 
 The people of the Goryeo Kingdom (918-1392) built a three-story [[pagoda]] at the house of Gang Gam-chan's birth to praise him for his great deeds.  He defeated 400,000 [[Invasion|invading]] [[Khitan]] [[Soldier|soldiers]]. Damaged parts of this pagoda were rebuilt by the [[Seoul]] Metropolitan Government in 1964, and the pagoda was named Seoul [[Wiktionary:tangible|Tangible]] Cultural Property No. 4 in 1972. Two years later, a [[shrine]] was built for Gang Gam-chan. The pagoda, which was originally at 218 Bongcheon-dong, was moved to be with the shrine.
