 A '''weed''' is a [[plant]] that people think is bad, because it is growing in the wrong place. Only smaller plants are often called weeds. < ref > [https://www.greendoctor.by/poleznye-stati/kak-izbavitsya-ot-sornoj-rastitelnosti-na-gazone/ How to get rid of weeds] < /ref > 
 
 A person may grow a plant because it has beautiful [[flower]]s, but other people may think that this plant is a weed for some reason. This may be for one of these reasons: 
 *It has [[pollen]] that makes them sneeze,  
 *It [[spread]]s [[seed]]s that will grow quickly,  
 *The [[root]]s go too far under the ground and can cause damage to houses or pipes,  
 *The [[root]]s [[spread]] quickly, 
 *The plant has [[poison]]ous [[berry|berries]], 
 *The plant has [[liquid]] ([[sap]]) in it that can hurt a person's [[skin]], 
 
 If someone is [[farm]]ing a plant and it then moves outside the farm, the plant may then be called a weed. 
 
 Some [[plant]]s are very hard to stop once they start growing. These are called [[Invasive species|invasive]] weeds.  
 
 Weed is also a name for any [[wild]] [[plant]], one that people do not use for anything.
