 '''Corrosion''' is the breakdown of [[material]]s due to [[chemical reaction]]s. It is usually [[oxidation]] with [[air]] [[molecule]]s and often in the presence of [[water]]. Corrosion also occurs when an [[acid]]ic/basic [[corrosive substance]] touches another material. When a material corrodes, its physical properties change. Problems with corrosion are mostly with [[metal]], though other materials can corrode. Corrosion is a form of [[erosion]]. Some materials, such as [[stainless steel]], are highly resistant to corrosion. Metals that may corrode can be protected by [[plating]], painting, and other means. 
 
 One form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of [[compacted oxide layer glaze]]s, which under certain circumstances reduces wear.  
 
 Iron corrosion is called [[rust]]ing.
