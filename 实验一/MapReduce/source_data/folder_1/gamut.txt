In  [[computer graphics]] and [[photography]], the '''gamut''', or '''color gamut''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|m|ə|t}}, is a certain ''[[subset]]'' of [[color]]s. Most often it is a subset of colors, which can be [[Accuracy and precision|accurately]] represented by some [[output device]]. 
 
 Another sense refers to the complete [[set]] of colors found within an image.  
 
 ==Introduction== 
 The term ''gamut'' was adopted from music, where in middle age [[Latin]]  " gamut "  meant the entire range of [[musical note]]s of which musical [[Melody|melodies]] are composed. In the 1850s, the term was used for a range of [[color]]s or [[hue]], for example by [[Thomas De Quincey]], who wrote  " [[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]], I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as [[marble]].

 In [[color theory]], the gamut of a device is the portion of the [[color space]] that it can show. 
 
 When certain colors cannot be presented within a particular [[color model]], those colors are said to be ''out of gamut''.  
 
 While processing a [[Image processing|digital image]], an image is usually recorded in [[RGB color model]]. When printing such image has to be converted from an original RGB color space to the printer's [[CMYK color model|CMYK color space]]. During this process, the colors, which are out of printer's gamut are [[Conversion of units|converted]] to the in-gamut colors. So, the final image is an [[approximation]] of the original one.  
 
 ==Representation of gamuts== 
 [[File:Colorspace.png|thumb|right|A comparison of the colors enclosed by some color spaces.]] 
 
 Gamuts are commonly represented as areas in the full visible range of colors. The full range of colors is usually shown as [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]] shaped like a [[horseshoe]]. 
 
 The gamut depends on the [[Luminosity|brightness]]. So a full gamut is represented in [[3D]] space. 
 
 ==Comparison of gamut of some devices== 
 
 The list contains some typical devices, wich show pictures, ranging from large to small color gamut: 
 
 * [[Laser video projector]] uses three [[laser|lasers]] to produce the broadest gamut available today. Because lasers produce truly [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] [[primary color|primaries]]. More than three lasers can be used together to increase the gamut range. 
 * [[Photographic film]] can reproduce a larger color gamut than typical television or computer. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/camera_scanner.html | title = Film gamut, apples, and oranges | access-date = 2007-04-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917062631/http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/camera_scanner.html | archive-date = 2008-09-17 | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 * [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays have a roughly triangular color gamut, which covers a large portion of the visible color space. In CRTs, the limitations are due to the [[phosphor]]s in the screen which produce red, green, and blue light. 
 * [[Printing]] typically uses the [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] color space ([[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]). Efforts have been made to expand the gamut of the printing process by adding [[ink]]s of non-primary colors. 
 * A [[monochrome]] display's color gamut is a one-dimensional curve in color space. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQffvaCaZlgC & dq=A+monochrome+display+color+gamut+is+a+one-dimensional+curve+in+color+space. & pg=PA137|title=Image Processing for Computer Graphics and Vision|last1=Velho|first1=Luiz|last2=Frery|first2=Alejandro C.|last3=Gomes|first3=Jonas|date=2009-04-29|publisher=Springer Science  &  Business Media|isbn=9781848001930|language=en}} < /ref >
