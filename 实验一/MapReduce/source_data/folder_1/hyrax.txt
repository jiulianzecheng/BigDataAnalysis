 '''Hyrax''' also called '''dassie''' is any of four species of thick, herbivorous [[mammal]]s in the order '''Hyracoidea''', any of six species of small hoofed mammal (ungulates) native to [[Africa]] and extreme southwestern [[Asia]]. 
 
 Hyraxes are well-furred rotund creatures with a short tail. Most measure between 30–70 & nbsp;cm long and weigh between 2–5 & nbsp;kg.  Hyraxes are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] of the Bible and it is possible that the Hebrew word for hyrax (''shafan'') is the source of the name of present-day [[Spain]].  Even though hyraxes are not native to Spain, [[rabbit]]s are, and the theory states that early Hebrew explorers considered the rabbits to be a variety of hyrax.
