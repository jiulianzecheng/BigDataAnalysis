 The '''attic''' is the [[highest]] [[part]] of a [[house]], it is directly below the [[roof]] and old house or old things inside the house like a vintage. It is sometimes used as [[storage]]. Some people have  " [[loft]] conversions "  (change the attic into a room people can use) so that they can sleep in it. Attics can be hard to reach, which is why many of them are not used. They can help keep the temperature of the house stable. 
 
 ==Origin==
