 A '''fairy''' or '''f√¶rie''' (Old English spelling) is a supposed [[magic]]al being that flies in the [[air]]. They are usually depicted as tiny girls or [[women]]. Some fairies have certain jobs, such as the [[Tooth fairy]], who gives [[money]] or treats under the [[pillow]] of small children who have had a [[tooth]] fall out.  
 
 ==In literature== 
 A [[fairy tale]] is a story with a [[wikt:plot|plot]] involving fairies. These stories are usually for children. Fairies come up in many [[fiction|fictional]] books such as  " ''[[Peter Pan]]'' "  and  " ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'' " . 
 
 ==In folklore== 
 Fairies can also be found in [[folklore]]. For instance, in [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], fairies are thought of as creatures that were defeated by the human race thousands of years ago and now live in [[cave|caverns]] in the world of Faerie.  Sometimes fairies are believed to be a kind of [[angel]]. Other times, they are believed to be [[demon]]s or spirits of the dead. Fairies are said to steal human babies and replace them with [[Changeling]]s.

 in [[Hyrule Warriors]] there is a playable fairy known as the Great Fairy.
