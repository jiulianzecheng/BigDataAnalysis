 ''Chandralekha'' is a 1948 Indian [[adventure movie]]. It was made by [[S. S. Vasan]] of [[Gemini Studios]]. The movie stars [[T. R. Rajakumari]], [[M. K. Radha]], and [[Ranjan]]. It tells the story of two brothers, Veerasimhan and Sasankan. They argue about ruling their dad's kingdom and marrying a village dancer named Chandralekha. 
 
 Development started in the 1940s. Before this one, Vasan had two very famous movies. He said his next movie would be ''Chandralekha''.  Veppathur Kittoo, a storyboard artist, made a story from a chapter in George W. M. Reynolds' book ''Robert Macaire: or, The French Bandit in England''. T. G. Raghavachari was the original director but left midway because of disagreements with Vasan. Vasan then directed a movie himself for the first time. 
 
 Originally in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and later [[Hindi]], ''Chandralekha'' took five years to make (1943-1948). There were many changes in the [[Screenwriter|script]], or movie plan. It was India's most expensive, or costly movie at the time. Vasan used all his money and sold his jewelry to complete it. Kamal Ghosh and K. Ramnoth were the cinematographers. The music, influenced by Indian and Western [[classical music]], was by S. Rajeswara Rao and M. D. Parthasarathy with lyrics by Papanasam Sivan and Kothamangalam Subbu. 
 
 ''Chandralekha'' released on 9 April 1948. The movie got good reviews but didn't make enough money. Vasan made a Hindi version with changes, new cast, and Hindi talking by Agha Jani Kashmiri and Pandit Indra. The Hindi version released on 24 December and did very well at the [[box office]]. This movie made [[South India|South Indian cinema]] famous in India and gave a very good reason for South Indian producers to sell their Hindi films in [[North India]]. 
 
 == Story == 
 Veerasimhan and Sasankan are the king's sons. Veerasimhan rides through a village. He meets Chandralekha, a dancer. They fall in love. Later the king decides to [[Abdication|give the throne]] to Veerasimhan. Sasankan gets angry. He forms a group of thieves. They do crimes. Chandralekha's father is hurt and dies. Chandralekha becomes an [[orphan]], someone with no parents. She joins a group of travelling musicians. Whilst they were travelling, Sasankan's gang attacks their caravan. 
 
 Sasankan tells Chandralekha to dance. She dances after Sasanken hits her, but then she escapes. Sasankan later captures Veerasimhan. Chandralekha sees Sasankan's men put Veerasimhan in a cave and hide it with a big rock. Chandralekha saves him with [[circus]] elephants. They join the circus to hide from Sasankan's men. Sasankan goes back to the [[palace]], locks up his parents, becomes the king, and sends a [[Espionage|spy]] to find Chandralekha. 
 
 The spy sees Chandralekha at the circus. The spy tries to catch her. Veerasimhan saves her. They join [[Roma people|gypsies]]. When Veerasimhan goes to try to get help, Sasankan's men find Chandralekha. They take her to the palace. Sasankan tries to get Chandralekha to love him. She pretends to faint. A circus friend comes as a healer and hides that she is a friend. They talk in secret. Sasankan is happy that Chandralekha is okay. Chandralekha pretends to be cured and agrees to marry Sasankan. She wants a drum dance at the royal wedding, and he agrees. 
 
 Large drums are in rows near the palace. Chandralekha joins the dancers on the drums. Sasankan is impressed by Chandralekha's dance. Veerasimhan's soldiers hide in the drums. The dance finishes, and they attack Sasankan's men. Veerasimhan and Sasankan do a long sword fight. Sasankan loses and is put in prison. Veerasimhan becomes the new king, and Chandralekha is the queen. His parents are set free.

 == Production == 
 
 === Development === 
 After the box office success of ''Bala Nagamma'' (1942) and ''Mangamma Sabatham'' (1943), producer S. S. Vasan of Gemini Studios wanted his next movie to be very big. He had no money limits.{{Sfn|Guy|1997}} He asked K. J. Mahadevan, Kothamangalam Subbu, Sangu, Naina and Veppathur Kittoo—to write a [[screenplay]], the movie story.{{Sfn|Banerjee|Srivastava|1988}} They wanted a similar story to ''Mangamma Sabatham'' and ''Bala Nagamma'' because they were  " heroine-oriented stories " . The group shared Chandralekha's tale. She was strong. She tricked a mean bandit, cut his nose, and used hot red chili powder. Vasan didn't like the violence and rudeness. He said no but kept her name.{{Sfn|Guy|1997}} 
 
 He announced ''Chandralekha'' without waiting for the story and advertised it a lot. But the story wasn't ready in three months. Vasan got impatient. He told the writers he would work on ''Avvaiyyar'' (1953) instead of ''Chandralekha''. After he gave them one more week,{{Sfn|Guy|1997}} Kittoo found George W. M. Reynolds' book, ''Robert Macaire; Or, the French Bandit in England''. In the first chapter, he read: 
 {{Blockquote|text=A dark night in rural England and a mail coach convoy drawn by horses trots its way down a deserted leafy highway when suddenly, [[Robert Macaire]], the fierce bandit and his henchmen emerge from the surrounding darkness and rob the convoy. Hiding under a seat is a young woman fleeing from a harsh, unhappy home. She is a dancer and when she refuses to dance the bandit whips her into submission. < ref name= " the hindu "  / > |author=|source=}} 
 Vasan was very happy when Kittoo told him a story based on the chapter. He started the film, and named the heroine Chandralekha. Although the story was created by Kittoo, the praise went to all of Gemini's story team.{{Sfn|Banerjee|Srivastava|1988}} T. G.

 The script had two main parts: the princes in a kingdom. The older was the hero, and the younger was the villain.{{Sfn|Guy|1997}} M. K. Radha got the role of Sasankan, the young prince. He usually did hero roles, so he didn't want to be a villain. So, he agreed to be Veerasimhan, the older prince.{{Sfn|Guy|1997}} His wife Gnanambal asked Vasan to cast Radha in the role.{{Sfn|Guy|1997}} K. J.

 The struggling actor V. C. Ganeshamurthy wanted a small role in ''Chandralekha''. He contacted Kittoo many times. Ganeshamurthy grew his hair long for a part as Veerasimhan's bodyguard. Kittoo introduced him to Vasan. Vasan watched his stage performance. Vasan rejected him for his movie, saying he was unfit. Vasan suggested Ganeshamurthy choose another profession. This caused a very long fight between Vasan and Ganeshamurthy. The role of the bodyguard went to N.

 In post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth about a scene with warriors saving Chandralekha. Others liked it, but Ramnoth worried about the  suspense. They talked, and Vasan told Chandru to edit as Ramnoth suggested. It worked well. C. E.

 ''Chandralekha'' took five years (1943–1948) to make. The story, cast, and filming changed a lot, which caused delays and extra costs. The movie cost ₹3 million in 1948, making it the most expensive Indian movie at the time. Vasan used all his money, got help from The Hindu editor Kasturi Srinivasan, and sold his jewelry to complete the film. According to historian S. Muthiah, it was the first movie outside the United States with a budget of over a million dollars due to fluctuating exchange rates. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Muthiah|first=S.|date=8 December 2003|title=When the postman knocked|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/12/08/stories/2003120800250300.htm|url-status=dead|access-date=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813064934/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/12/08/stories/2003120800250300.htm|archive-date=13 August 2014}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Rajakarunanayake|first=Lucien|date=2 June 2010|title=The star trek from Chintamani to Vijay|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/06/star-trek-from-chintamani-to-vijay.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828231158/http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/06/star-trek-from-chintamani-to-vijay.html|archive-date=28 August 2010|access-date=9 September 2013|website=The Sri Lanka Guardian}} < /ref > 
 
 == Themes and influences == 
 ''Chandralekha'' is not a historical movie even though it is a period film.{{Sfn|Gulazāra|Nihalani|Chatterjee|2003}} It's based on ''Robert Macaire'' < nowiki/ > 's first chapter. Sasankan is like Macaire, and Chandralekha is influenced by Western stories like ''Blood and Sand, [[The Mark of Zorro (1920 movie)|The Mark of Zorro]], Robin Hood, The Thief of Baghdad,'' and ''Ben-Hur''.{{Sfn|Armes|1987}} Jerzy Toeplitz said the characters act like gods in the Mahabharata. The story holds different episodes together like a circus. Uday Shankar's ''Kalpana'' inspired ''Chandralekha''. In the 2003 Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema, it's called a  " period extravaganza " .{{Sfn|Dwyer|Patel|2002}} < ref > {{Cite web|last=Toeplitz|first=Jerry|author-link=Jerzy Toeplitz|date=23 December 1964|title=Indian films and Western audiences|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001341/134149eo.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208164919/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001341/134149eo.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2012|access-date=4 August 2014|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}} < /ref > {{Sfn|Garga|2005}} 
 
 The ending sword fight between Veerasimhan and Sasankan is similar to the fight in the 1894 novel, ''The Prisoner of Zenda''. In 1976, American movie historian William K. Everson said the comedians in ''Chandralekha'' were similar to [[Laurel and Hardy]]. French movie historian Yves Thoraval said that it  " prefigured the dance that ''Chandralekha'' made famous the very next year. " {{Sfn|Thoraval|2000}}  
 
 == Music == 
 ''Chandralekha''{{'s}} soundtrack was created by S. Rajeswara Rao, with the speech by Papanasam Sivan and Kothamangalam Subbu. R. Vaidyanathan and B. Das Gupta worked with M. D. Parthasarathy on the background music. Rajeswara Rao said that in a 1993 interview for ''The Hindu'' it took him over a year to create the film's music:  " As the dancers performed, we used to rehearse and compose the music. It was done with incredibly few instruments. We used a piano, ten double-bass violins, and drums from Africa, Egypt, and Persia which we have acquired from an African War troupe. "  Rao's payment was {{Indian Rupee}}1,500. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Narasimham|first=M. L.|date=12 March 1993|title=Trend-setter in Light Music|work=[[The Hindu]]}} < /ref >  The music was based by Carnatic and Hindustani music, [[Latin music|Latin American]] and Portuguese folk music and [[Johann Strauss I|Strauss]] waltzes. M. K. Raghavendra said that ''Chandralekha'' has  " snatches from [[Richard Wagner|[Richard] Wagner]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|[Nikolai] Rimsky-Korsakov]] (''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scherezade]]'') being used at dramatic moments.

 " Naattiya Kuthirai, "  not part of the film, was added after during final production. Sundari Bai spent over a month practicing the song. M. D. Parthasarathy was the only singer of  " Aathoram Kodikkalam "  and also sang  " Naattiya Kuthirai "  with someone else. J. Cooling Rajaiah played the [[accordion]] and [[piano]] in the gypsy song of the movie. The circus song was from  " The Donkey Serenade "  in Robert Z. Leonard's 1937 movie, The Firefly. Vasan gave most of the songs on the Hindi soundtrack to Uma Devi, who became famously known as Tun Tun after. She first thought that the songs were too difficult for her, but Rajeswara Rao worked very much with her.  " Sanjh Ki Bela, "  from the Hindi soundtrack, is based on  " Sanjh Ki Bela Panchhi Akela "  from Jwar Bhata (1944). Chandralekha's music helped it become one of the most successful Indian musical movies of the 1940s and gave a lot of ideas to many Tamil cinema music directors who liked Western music. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQoqAAAAYAAJ & q=chandraleka+donkey+serenade|title=Religion and Society, Volume 12|publisher=Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society|year=1965|pages=103|access-date=25 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220623102005/https://books.google.com/books?id=rQoqAAAAYAAJ & q=chandraleka+donkey+serenade|archive-date=23 June 2022}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|last=Guy|first=Randor|date=23 September 2010|title=Unsung veteran of Tamil cinema|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/unsung-veteran-of-tamil-cinema/article786500.ece|access-date=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805052123/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/unsung-veteran-of-tamil-cinema/article786500.ece|archive-date=5 August 2013}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|last=Nainar|first=Nahla|date=8 July 2016|title=The uncrowned Raja of sacred music|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/innumerable-gems-of-composermusician-j-cooling-rajaiahs-phenomenal-body-of-work-continue-to-enthral-listeners-and-performers-way-beyond-the-shores-of-their-birth/article8824275.ece|access-date=26 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726044007/http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/innumerable-gems-of-composermusician-j-cooling-rajaiahs-phenomenal-body-of-work-continue-to-enthral-listeners-and-performers-way-beyond-the-shores-of-their-birth/article8824275.ece|archive-date=26 July 2016}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|last=Kaur|first=Devinder Bir|date=7 December 2003|title=Hindi cinema's first-ever comedienne|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031207/spectrum/main6.htm|access-date=24 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901001054/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031207/spectrum/main6.htm|archive-date=1 September 2013}} < /ref > {{Sfn|Vijayakar|2009}} < ref > {{Cite magazine|date=July 1949|title=Woes  &  Echoes|url=https://archive.org/stream/filmindia194915unse#page/n459/mode/2up|url-status=live|magazine=[[Filmindia]]|page=70|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/filmindia194915unse|archive-date=29 April 2014}} < /ref >
