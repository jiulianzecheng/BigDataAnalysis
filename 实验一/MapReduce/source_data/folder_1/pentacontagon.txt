 == Regular pentacontagon == 
 A ''[[regular polygon|regular]] pentacontagon'' is represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {50} and can be constructed as a quasiregular [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] icosipentagon, t{25}, which alternates two types of edges. 
 
 === Area === 
 One interior angle in a regular pentacontagon is 172{{frac|4|5}}°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 7{{frac|1|5}}°. 
 
 The [[area]] of a regular pentacontagon is (with {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} edge length}}) 
 : < math > A = \frac{25}{2}t^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{50} < /math > 
 
 and its [[inradius]] is 
 : < math > r = \frac{1}{2}t \cot \frac{\pi}{50} < /math > 
 
 The [[circumradius]] of a regular pentacontagon is 
 
 : < math > R = \frac{1}{2}t \csc \frac{\pi}{50} < /math > 
 
 Since 50 = 2 × 5 < sup > 2 < /sup > , a regular pentacontagon is not [[constructible polygon|constructible]] using a [[compass and straightedge]], < ref > [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConstructiblePolygon.html Constructible Polygon] < /ref >  and is not constructible even if the use of an [[angle trisector]] is allowed. < ref name= " Eekhoff " > {{cite web |url=http://www.math.iastate.edu/thesisarchive/MSM/EekhoffMSMSS07.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714082609/http://www.math.iastate.edu/thesisarchive/MSM/EekhoffMSMSS07.pdf |archive-date=2015-07-14 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Dissection== 
 [[File:50-gon rhombic dissection-size2.svg|thumb|50-gon with 1200 rhombs]] 
 [[Coxeter]] states that every [[zonogon]] (a 2''m''-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into ''m''(''m''-1)/2 parallelograms. < ref > [[Coxeter]], Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 < /ref > 
 In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the ''regular pentacontagon'', ''m''=25, it can be divided into 300: 12 sets of 25 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a [[Petrie polygon]] projection of a [[25-cube]].
