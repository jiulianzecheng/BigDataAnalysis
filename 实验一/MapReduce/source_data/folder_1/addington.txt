 '''Addington''' is a village in the [[London Borough of Croydon]] in south [[London]]. Addington is home to many historical sites in Croydon, like Croydon Palace and the Addington Palace. St Mary's Church is also in Addington and is known for the cross commemorating five archbishops in the foreground. Before the tram system was introduced in 2000 connections to the town were very short with only a few buses to [[Croydon]].  
 
 New Addington is a town close by to Addington. Once there was only one school in the village and all the children went to it, now that school has been demolished.
