 '''Monoplacophora'''  < ref > meaning 'bearing one plate' < /ref >  is a [[Class (biology)|class]] of [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. They have a cap-like shell and live on the bottom of the sea. < ref > Menzies R.J. ''et al'' 1959. Ecology of the Recent Monoplacophora. ''Oikos'' '''10''' (2): 168–182. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3565144?uid=3738032 & uid=2 & uid=4 & sid=21103195603197] < /ref >   
 
 They were well-known as a fossil group from the [[Cambrian]] to the [[Devonian]]. One species was dredged up from the [[Pacific Ocean]] off [[Mexico]] in 1952. It was found to be a Monoplacophoran, and given the genus of ''[[Neopilina]]''. < ref > Lemche, Henning 1957. ''Nature'' '''179''', 413–416. < /ref >   This was one of the most remarkable modern discoveries of a '[[living fossil]]', and a [[Lazarus taxon]].  
 
 More than that, they are the most extreme example of the ''pull of the recent'', which is a term in [[palaeontology]]. All fossil groups have a first and last appearance in the fossil record but, for living species, their last appearance is the present day. This may be very much later than their last appearance as a fossil. The discovery of the living monoplacs extended their time range by 400 million years. < ref > Hallam A. and Wignall P.B. 1997.

 The anatomy of ''Neopilina'' shows  " serially repeated structures "  such as [[gills]]. Serial repetition of anatomical structures such as gills and muscles may have evolved once in the common ancestor of [[chiton]]s and monoplacophorans. It suggests the ancient ancestor of molluscs had [[bilateral symmetry]], and [[segment]]s. < ref > Giribet, Gonzalo ''et al'' 2006. Evidence for a clade composed of molluscs with serially repeated structures: Monoplacophorans are related to chitons. ''PNAS'' '''103''', 7723–7728.
