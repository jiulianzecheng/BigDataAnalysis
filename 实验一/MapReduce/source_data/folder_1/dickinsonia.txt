 '''''Dickinsonia''''' is  an [[Ediacaran biota|early type]] of [[pre-Cambrian]] life.  They were very different from current [[Organism|organisms]]. They are considered to be one of the early forms of [[Multicellular organism|multicellular organisms]].  Their bodies were shaped like discs. Based on the [[Fossil|fossils]], they were between four millimeteers an 1.4m in size. < ref name= " Retallack GJ (2007) " > {{cite journal|author=Retallack GJ|year=2007|title=Growth, decay and burial compaction of Dickinsonia, an iconic Ediacaran fossil|journal=Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology|volume=31|issue=3|pages=215–240|doi=10.1080/03115510701484705|s2cid=17181699}} < /ref >  They were only a few millimetres thick.  Their body was segmented: there is a large central furrow, and smaller ones around the body of the organism. Their body was [[Symmetry|symmetric]].  Mostly based on the shape and size of the fossils found, they have been classified into different species.  
 
 The Dickinsonia species probably did not move around the [[ocean]] on their own: they used ocean currents to float around. Possibly they had a way to attach to the ocean floor.  Their feeding probably resembled that of the  [[placozoa]]. < ref name= " Sperling EA  &  Vinther J (2010) "  / > 
 
 == Problems with classification == 
 They were also compared to modern-day [[Cnidaria|Cnidarians]], [[Polychaete|Polychaetes]], and [[Turbellaria]]. Because of the prominent central part, they were also seen as [[Chordate|Chordates]].  Because of their feeding habit, they were classified as similar ot the Placozoa. < ref name= " Sperling EA  &  Vinther J (2010) " > {{cite journal|author=Sperling EA, Vinther J|year=2010|title=A placozoan affinity for Dickinsonia and the evolution of late Proterozoic metazoan feeding modes|journal=Evolution  &  Development|volume=12|issue=2|pages=201–209|doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2010.00404.x|pmid=20433459|s2cid=38559058}} < /ref >  It was suggested, that they lived in [[symbiosis]] with organisms doing [[photosynthesis]], and were possibly comparable to modern-day [[Lichen]]; if the mechanism worked the same as in modern-day lichens, they would be [[Fungus|fungi]]. < ref name= " Retallack GJ (1994) " > {{cite journal|author=Retallack GJ|year=1994|title=Were the Ediacaran Fossils Lichens?|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_paleobiology_fall-1994_20_4/page/523|journal=Paleobiology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=523–544|doi=10.1017/S0094837300012975|s2cid=129180481 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Dickinsonia are animals === 
 A study published in 2018, has shown Dickinsonia  were [[animal|animals]]. < ref name= " Bob " > Bobrovskiy, Ilya ''et al'' 2018.

 : " The fossils contained almost exclusively [[cholesterol|cholesteroids]], a marker found only in animals... Thus, ''Dickinsonia'' were basal animals. This supports the idea that the [[Ediacaran biota]] may have been a precursor to the explosion of animal forms later seen in the [[Cambrian]], about 500 million years ago " . < ref name=Bob/ > 
 
 Very little cholesterol was found outside the specimen in the surrounding rock. The Ediacara biota (571 million to 541 million years ago) is the first complex organisms in the geological record large enough to be seen without magnification. < ref > Rincon, Paul 2018.

 == History of discovery == 
 The first fossils were found in the [[Flinders Ranges]], in [[Australia]] in the 1940s. Reginald Sprigg, a paleontologist, published the first scientific study of Dickinsonia in 1947. < ref name= " Sprigg RC (1947) " > {{cite journal|author=Sprigg RC|year=1947|title=Early Cambrian (?) jellyfishes from the Flinders Ranges, South Australia|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia|volume=71|pages=212–224}} < /ref >  Sprigg named the genus after Ben Dickinson, who was the director of the Mines of South Australia, at the time.  In the study, Sprigg thought t he had found the fossil of a [[jellyfish]]. In 1956, Harrington and Moore classified Dickinsonia as Cnidarians. < ref name= " Harrington HJ  &  Moore RC (1956) " > {{cite book|author=Harrington HJ, [[Raymond Cecil Moore|Moore RC]]|year=1956|chapter=Medusa of the Hydroidea|editor=Moore RC|title=Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part F: Coelenterata|publisher=GSA and University of Kansas Press|location=Kansas|pages=77–80}} < /ref > In 1966, they were classified as [[Annelid|Annelids]]. < ref name= " Glaessner MF  &  Wade M (1966) " > {{cite journal|author=Glaessner MF, Wade M|year=1966|title=The late Precambrian fossils from Ediacara, South Australia|journal=Palaeontology|volume=9|pages=599–628}} < /ref >  Most Annelid fossils are quite different from fossilized Dickinsonia, but they resemble some fossilized marine worms.  S. Manton contradicted this interpretation in 1967. < ref name= " Manton SM (1967) " > {{cite journal|author=Manton SM|year=1967|title=The polychaete ''Spinther'' and the origin of the Arthropoda|journal=Journal of Natural History|volume=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1080/00222936700770601}} < /ref >  Because of these incertainities, the discussion about how to classify Dickinsonia is still ongoing.
