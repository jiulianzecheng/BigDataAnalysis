 A '''phosphate''' is a [[salt]] of [[phosphoric acid]]. Phosphates are important in [[biochemistry]]. 
 Phosphates have the formula PO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 3- < /sup >  and a molar mass of 94.973 g/mol. An example of a phosphate is [[sodium phosphate]]. Three different types of phosphates are known.  They are orthophosphate, PO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 3- < /sup > ; metaphosphate, PO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > ; and pyrophosphate, P < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 7 < /sub > < sup > 3- < /sup > . They have a combining power of 3.

 == Structure == 
 Phosphates are made of one [[phosphorus]] [[atom]] surrounded by four [[oxygen]] atoms.  
 Many phosphates do not [[solvation|dissolve]] in water.
