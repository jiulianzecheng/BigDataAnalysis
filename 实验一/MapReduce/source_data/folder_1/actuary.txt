 '''Actuaries''' are people who are experts in [[mathematics]], [[probability]], [[economy|economics]], and [[finance]] who figure out how much [[money]] [[business]]es should charge for making [[promise]]s to pay for something that may or may not happen. < ref name =  " Trow " > {{cite document

 ==History== 
 Hundreds of years ago, when people got sick or died, it cost a lot of [[money]] to take care of them or [[burial|bury]] them. People had the idea of joining their money together to help each other out. This was called [[pool]]ing. Eventually, people started to make a [[business]] out of collecting enough money to help people who had big problems. < ref name =  " Hist " > {{cite web

 Figuring out how much money needed to be collected from people to be used if problems happened was not easy. Over hundreds of years, the math needed for this was developed by many people from all over the world. < ref name =  " Hist "  / > 
 
 Today, actuaries use [[computer]]s to figure out problems that were too difficult before. < ref name =  " MacGin " > {{cite journal

 ==Work== 
 Actuaries now work in many places. Most work for [[insurance]] [[company|companies]], but others work in all kinds of [[finance]] [[company|companies]]. < ref name =  " BLS " > {{cite web

 }} < /ref >  Actuaries still figure out how much money needs to be paid for life insurance, as well as other kinds of money promises, like [[pension]]s, [[car]] insurance, < ref > {{Cite web|title=Car Insurance|url=https://www.moneymagpie.com/manage-your-money/discover-how-to-save-hundreds-on-car-insurance-costs|access-date=2021-04-13|website=MoneyMagpie|language=en-GB|archive-date=2021-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413071209/https://www.moneymagpie.com/manage-your-money/discover-how-to-save-hundreds-on-car-insurance-costs|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  [[house]] insurance, and similar. < ref name =  " BLS "  / > 
 
 Actuaries also work with companies to figure out if making certain business deals are a good idea, since actuaries work with figuring out what the [[Probability|probabilities]] are of different business situations happening. < ref name =  " BLS "  / > 
 
 ==Tests== 
 People who want to be actuaries need to take many [[test]]s. The tests are not the same in different parts of the world.
