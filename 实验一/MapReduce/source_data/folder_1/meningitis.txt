[[File:Meningite.png|thumb|right|A map of the world showing where meningitis is most common. Countries in red: Meningitis is common (So-called ''meningitis belt'' in Africa). Countries in brown: Sometimes there are [[epidemics]] of meningitis. Countries in grey: They may be a few cases of meningitis, each year. Note the map is not completely accurate though.]] 
 '''Meningitis''' is an [[infection]] of certain [[membrane]]s and [[Tissue (biological)|tissues]] of the [[nervous system]]. Those are called [[meninges]] (singular: meninx). Their function is to protect the central nervous system. Most often, this infection is caused by [[microorganism]]s, like [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] or [[parasite]]s. The most common cause of meningitis are viruses, followed by bacteria. Meningitis is a life-threatening condition. It affects all age groups. 
 
 Some kinds of meningitis are very easy to spread. For this reason, in certain countries, like Germany, doctors have to tell the authorities that someone might have meningitis. 
 
 == Signs of meningitis == 
 Some signs  of meningitis can be: high [[fever]], sometimes with [[chill]]s; very strong [[headache]]; [[nausea]]s and [[vomit]]ing; [[drowsiness]] or [[confusion]]; twitching; sleepiness; sore throat; [[delirium]] (especially in children); [[seizure]]s; and stiff neck (in less than 50% of the cases, but may be a telltale sign). 
 
 ==Types== 
 The two main forms of meningitis are [[bacterial meningitis]] and [[viral meningitis]]. In bacterial meningitis, most patients die without treatment, whereas in viral meningitis most patients get better on their own. Herpes virus meningitis may respond to an antiviral drug. < ref > [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meningitis/DS00118/DSECTION=treatments%2Dand%2Ddrugs Meningitis at the Mayo Clinic website] < /ref >
