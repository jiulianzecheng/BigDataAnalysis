 A  " '''dozen " ''' is a unit of measurement. It means twelve (12) items of something. The term goes back to ''duodecim'', which means 12 in  [[Latin language|Latin]]. Humans might have started to count on a base 12 because there are approximately 12 [[cycle]]s of the [[moon]] in one cycle of the [[sun]]. In other words, a solar year has 12 months. The first to have used the unit were probably the [[Mesopotamia]]ns. 
 
 12 dozen  (144 items) are a '''[[gross (unit)|gross]]'''. 12 gross (1728 items) are called a ''[[great gross]]''.  
 A [[great hundred]] is 120 or ten dozen (a dozen for each finger on both hands). 
 
 The dozen is convenient because its multipliers and multiples are convenient: 12 = 3  & times; 2  & times; 2, and 360 = 30  & times; 12. The [[French_Language|French]] word ''douzaine'' means  " about twelve "  and is part of a family of words with similar meanings, e.g. ''vingtaine'' –  " about 20 "   ''centaine'' –  " about 100 "   etc. A '''[[baker's dozen]]''', also known as a '''long dozen''', is [[thirteen]].
