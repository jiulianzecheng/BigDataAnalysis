 '''Darmstadtium''' is a [[chemical element]]. It has been named '''ununnilium (Uun)''' or '''eka-platinum''' but is now named darmstadtium. It has the symbol '''Ds'''. It has the [[atomic number]] 110. It is a [[transuranium element]].

 The element is named in honor of German city [[Darmstadt]]. 
 
 Darmstadtium is a [[radioactive]] element that does not exist in nature. It has to be made. The [[isotope]]s with an [[atomic mass]] from 267 to 273 have very short [[Half-life (element)|half-lifes]]. The half life of these isotopes is [[measure]]d in [[SI|milli]][[second]]s. Isotopes of darmstadtium with an atomic mass of 279 and 281 were synthesised after the other isotopes. Ds-279 and Ds-281 [[radioactive decay|decay]] more slowly. The isotope with an atomic mass of 279 has a half life of 180 milliseconds and Ds-281 has a half life of 11.1 & nbsp;seconds. 
 
 No uses for darmstadtium are known. What darmstadtium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight. 
 
 == History == 
 Darmstadtium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first made]] on [[November 9]], [[1994]]. It was made at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]. Only a few [[atom]]s of it were made. It was made by [[bombardment|bombarding]] a lead [[wikt:target|target]] with [[nickel]]. A [[nuclear fusion]] [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] happened and made the element. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Holleman| first1 = A.F.| last2 = Wiberg| first2 = Egon| last3 = Wiberg| first3 = Nils| title = Inorganic Chemistry| year = 2001| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-12-352651-9 }} < /ref > 
 
 This is shown by the [[equation]] below that is the reaction that happened. Pb is the symbol for [[lead]], Ni is the symbol for nickel and n is the symbol for a [[neutron]].

 The element was named for Darmstadt which was the place of its discovery. The GSI is in Wixhausen, a part of the north of the city of Darmstadt. The new name (darmstadtium) was given to the chemical element by the [[IUPAC]] in August [[2003]]. < ref > [http://www.iupac.org/news/archives/2003/naming110.html IUPAC: Element 110 is named darmstadtium] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031001232857/http://www.iupac.org/news/archives/2003/naming110.html |date=2003-10-01 }} (HTML) Accessed 21 November 2006. < /ref >
