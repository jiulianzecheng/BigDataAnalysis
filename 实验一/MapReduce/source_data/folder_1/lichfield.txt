 '''Lichfield''' is a small [[city]] in [[Staffordshire]], [[England]]. 
 
 The first part of the name comes from a nearby [[Roman Britain|Roman-British]] [[village]] called ''Letocetum''. It was captured by the [[Germanic peoples|Mercia]]ns some time before 669, when it was called ''Licidfelth''. Between 786 and 803, the [[Christian]] [[archbishop]] in England was here, instead of [[Canterbury]].
