 ''Centrosaurus'' was first discovered near the [[Red Deer River]] in [[Alberta]]. Vast bonebeds of ''Centrosaurus'' were found in [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], also in [[Alberta]]. Some of these beds extend for hundreds of meters and contain thousands of individuals of all ages and all levels of completion. < ref > ''Centrosaurus'', in: Dodson, Peter; Britt, Brooks; Carpenter, Kenneth; Forster, Catherine A; Gillette, David D; Norell, Mark A;  Olshevsky, George; Parrish J.

 This would be explained if they had perished while trying to cross a flooded river. A discovery of thousands of ''Centrosaurus'' fossils near the town of [[Hilda, Alberta|Hilda]], [[Alberta]], is believed to be the largest bed of dinosaur bones ever discovered. The area is now known as the [[Hilda mega-bonebed]]. < ref > Scientists find dino deathbed, signs of carnage.
