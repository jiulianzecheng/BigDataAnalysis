 '''Chromatids''' are the daughter strands of a duplicated [[chromosome]] which are joined by a single [[centromere]]. When the centromere divides, the chromatids become separate chromosomes. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. p79 < /ref > 
 
 Each of the two daughter chromatids contains the same [[DNA]] and [[chromatin]] [[protein]] as its original chromosome. But in [[meiosis]], crossing over (exchanges) take place between two of the non-sister chromatids. This has profound consequences: it produces genetic [[recombination]], and increases the variability of [[gamete]]s.
