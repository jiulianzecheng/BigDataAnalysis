 '''''Rahonavis''''' is a [[genus]] of [[bird]]-like [[feathered dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]], 70–65 million years ago (mya) of what is now northwestern [[Madagascar]]. 
 
 It is known from a partial skeleton found in a quarry. ''Rahonavis'' was a small predator, at about {{convert|70|cm|ft}} long, < ref name= " Holtz2008 " > Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. 2008. ''Dinosaurs: the most complete, up-to-date encyclopedia for dinosaur lovers of all ages''. [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/dinoappendix/DinoappendixSummer2008.pdf Supplementary Information] < /ref >  with the typical ''[[Velociraptor]]''-like raised [[sickle]] [[claw]] on the second toe. 
 
 ==Classification== 
 ''Rahonavis'' has [[feather|quill knobs]] on its [[ulna]] (forearm bone), which led at first to its inclusion among the birds. However, the rest of the skeleton is rather typically [[dromaeosaur]]id. 
 
 Makovicky and colleagues consider ''Rahonavis'' to be closely related to the South American dromaeosaurids ''[[Unenlagia]]'' and ''[[Buitreraptor]]'', and thus a member of the subfamily [[Unenlagiinae]]. < ref name =  " makovickyetal2005 " > {{cite journal|year=2005|title=The earliest dromaeosaurid theropod from South America|journal=Nature|volume=437 |issue=7061 |pages=1007–1011 |doi=10.1038/nature03996 |pmid=16222297 |bibcode=2005Natur.437.1007M|s2cid=27078534|last1=Makovicky|first1=Peter J.|last2=Apesteguía|first2=Sebastián|last3=Agnolín|first3=Federico L.}} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7061/suppinfo/nature03996.html Supplementary information]. < /ref >  Norell and colleagues (2006) also found ''Rahonavis'' to lie within the Unenlagiinae, as the sister [[taxon]] to ''Unenlagia'' itself. < ref name= " norelletal2006 " > {{cite journal|last=Norell|first=M.A. | display-authors = etal ''|year=2006|title=A new dromaeosaurid theropod from Ukhaa Tolgod (Omnogov, Mongolia)|journal=American Museum Novitates|issue=3545|pages=1–51|doi=10.1206/0003-0082(2006)3545[1:ANDTFU]2.0.CO;2|url=https://zenodo.org/record/5386073 }} < /ref >  A 2007 study by Turner and colleagues again found it to be closely related to ''Unenlagia''. < ref name=AHTetal07 > {{cite journal |last=Turner |first=Alan H. | display-authors = etal|year=2007 |title=A basal dromaeosaurid and size evolution preceding avian flight |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/317/5843/1378.pdf |journal=Science |volume=317 |pages=1378–1381 |doi=10.1126/science.1144066 |pmid=17823350 |issue=5843 |bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1378T |s2cid=2519726 }} < /ref >   However, studies published since 2009 that have found many traditional  " dromaeosaurids " , including the unenlagiines, closer to Avialae than to dromaeosaurines.

 ''Rahonavis'' was one-fifth larger than the closely related ''Archaeopteryx'', about the size of a modern [[raven]]. < ref name= " chiappe2007 " / > 
 
 Although numerous artists' reconstructions of ''Rahonavis'' show it in flight, it is not clear that it could fly. There is even been some doubt that the forearm material, which includes the quill knobs, belongs with the rest of the skeleton. Some researchers have suggested that ''Rahonavis'' represents a [[chimaera]], with the forelimb of a bird mixed with the skeleton of a dromaeosaurid. < ref name= " geist & feduccia2000 " > {{cite journal|year=2000|title=Gravity-defying behaviors: identifying models for Protoaves|journal=American Zoologist|issue=4|pages=664–675|doi=10.1668/0003-1569(2000)040[0664:GDBIMF]2.0.CO;2|volume=40 |url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/40/4/664.pdf |last1= Geist|first1= Nicholas R.|last2= Feduccia|first2= Alan|s2cid=11576813 }} < /ref > 
 
 The nearby discovery of the primitive bird ''[[Vorona berivotrensis]]'' shows that the possibility of a mix-up cannot be entirely excluded. However, many other scientists, including the original describers of ''Rahonavis'', think its remains belong to a single animal. The wing bones are close to the rest of the skeleton. All the bones attributed to ''Rahonavis'' were buried in an area  " smaller than a letter-sized page " , according to co-describer Luis M. Chiappe in his 2007 book ''Glorified Dinosaurs''. < ref name= " chiappe2007 " > {{cite book|last=Chiappe|first= L.M.|title=Glorified Dinosaurs: the origin and early evolution of birds|date= 2 February 2007|location=Sydney|publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=9780471247234}} < /ref >  Chiappe maintained that ''Rahonavis'' could probably fly, noting that its ulna was large and robust compared to ''Archaeopteryx'', and that this fact, coupled with the prominent quill knobs, suggest that ''Rahonavis'' had larger and more powerful wings than that earlier bird. In addition, ''Rahonavis'' shoulder bones show evidence of ligament attachments allowing the independent mobility needed for flapping flight. Chiappe concluded that ''Rahonavis'' was capable of flight, though it would have been more  " clumsy in the air than modern birds " . < ref name= " chiappe2007 " / >
