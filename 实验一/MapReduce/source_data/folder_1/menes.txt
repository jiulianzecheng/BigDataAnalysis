 '''Menes''' was a [[pharaoh]] of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. He lived ca. 3100-3000 BC. He brought together [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]] to make an empire. He wore the [[Pschent]] or double crown: the white crown of Upper Egypt and the red crown of Lower Egypt. He built the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and made it the capital. 
 
 There is a lot of archeological evidence that there was a pharaoh named Narmer, but little evidence for a pharaoh named Menes. < ref > Gardiner, Alan. ''Egypt of the Pharaohs.'' p. 405. Oxford University Press, 1961 < /ref >   It is now believed that Menes was either [[Narmer]], the pharaoh before Narmer, or [[Hor-Aha]], who ruled after him. 
 
 More than 2000 years later [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that Menes ruled for 62 years and was killed by a [[hippopotamus]].
