 A '''sabra''', Hebrew: צבר‎‎ - tzabar, is a [[Jew]] who is born in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Palestine]], [[Mandatory Palestine]] or in the [[State of Israel]]. As of 2015, about three quarters of the Israeli Jews are sabras. 
 
 The term  " sabra "  is derived from the [[prickly pear]]. Like this [[cactus]] a sabra is supposed to be hard on the outside but soft on the inside.
