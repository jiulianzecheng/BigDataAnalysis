 ==Game Process== 
   
 '''The Boxman''' - is the one who’s in charge of the Craps table. He’s not only watching over the chips but also taking care of any issues that may arise during a game. Usually, he’s wearing a suit and tie, and his place is in the center of the table at one side, near the chips. 
   
 '''The Stickman''' - is in charge of the center of the layout and uses a stick to move the dice. His place is on the opposite side of the table from the Boxman. The stick is needed because dealers never touch the dice, so the Stickman has to be able to reach them wherever they land. He’s also announcing each roll of the dice and passes them to the shooter when all payoffs are done. 
 
 '''The Dealers''' - are the ones who take care of the layouts, one layout per dealer. There are two dealers at the table and one on a break, and they stand at the sides of the Boxman. Their duty is to correctly pay all bets at their side of the table and exchange chips for cash.
