'''Choreography''' (dance-writing) is the [[art]] of making [[dance]]s. It tells dancers how they should dance and move. The word has been used since the late 18th century to mean the art of composing dance. < ref > Crane Debra  &  Mackrell, Judith 2000. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance''. < /ref > 
 
 A person who does choreography is called a ''[[choreographer]]''. A choreographer makes a dance based on music or a synopsis (a writing of what occurs in the dance). They may also act as trainers for [[professional]] dancers in [[ballet]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] shows and competitive [[ballroom dance]]. Their ideas may be recorded in dance notation, or on [[video]]s. 
 
 Choreography is also used in other types of [[performance]]s. In [[Ice skating]] and [[Ice dancing]], the choreographer [[design]]s the moves the skates does. In [[theater]], [[movie]]s and [[television]], a choreographer is used to design [[fight ]]scenes. For example, [[Bob Anderson]] designed many of the [[sword ]]fight scenes in the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' movies as well as some of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies. A person who does this type of choreography is usually called a ''fight choreographer''.
