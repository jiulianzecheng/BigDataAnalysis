 An '''aquarium''' ([[plural]] ''aquariums'' or ''aquaria'') is a place where [[fish]] and other [[animal]]s that live in [[water]] are kept by [[human]]s. An aquarium can be a small [[wikt:tank|tank]], or a large [[building]] with one or more large tanks. 
 
 Keeping an aquarium is a popular [[hobby]] around the world. Careful [[Fishkeeping|aquarist]]s (people who keeps aquariums) make sure their fish live in an [[environment]] similar to their [[nature|natural]] [[habitat]]s. This means caring about water [[quality]], [[lighting]], and [[food]]. 
 
 Large public aquariums are often popular with [[tourist]]s. They show the fish and other animals they keep in large tanks, and also often protect [[species]] that are close to [[extinction]]. An example of a public aquarium is [[Sydney Aquarium]], [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. 
 
 == History == 
 The artificial fish [[habitat]]  have existed since ancient times. [[Sumer|Sumerians]] kept fishes in [[Pond|ponds]] before [[cooking]] them.
