 '''iCal''' is a personal [[calendar]] [[Application software|application]] made by [[Apple Inc.]] that runs on the [[macOS]] [[operating system]]. iCal was the first calendar application for macOS to offer support for multiple [[calendar]]s and the ability to publish/subscribe calendars to [[WebDAV]] server. 
 
 Originally released as a free download for [[Mac OS]] X v10.2 on [[September 10]] [[2002]], with the release of Mac OS X v10.3 it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5.  Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v10.4, Version 3 with Mac OS X v10.5 and Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v10.6. 
 
 Apple [http://www.brownbearsw.com/ical/icalfaq.html#thename licensed]  the iCal name from [http://www.brownbearsw.com/ Brown Bear Software], who  used it for their [http://www.brownbearsw.com/ical/ iCal application] since 1997. 
 
 iCal development is quite different from other Apple software because it was designed independently by a small French team working  " secretly "  in [[Paris]], led by Jean-Marie Hullot, a friend of [[Steve Jobs]]. iCal's development has been transferred to Apple US headquarters in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]]. < ref > {{cite web | last = McLean | first = Prince | title = Road to Mac OS X Leopard: iCal 3.0 | work = AppleInsider | date = 17 October 2007 | url = http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/10/17/road_to_mac_os_x_leopard_ical_3_0.html & page=2 | accessdate = 2007-11-02 | archive-date = 2007-10-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019015944/http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/10/17/road_to_mac_os_x_leopard_ical_3_0.html%26page%3D2 | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Features== 
 *It tracks events and [[appointment]]s, allows multiple calendar views (such as calendars for  " home " ,  " work " ) to quickly identify conflicts and free time.

 ===Bugs=== 
 It has been reported that some users of iCal who have their calendar on a CalDAV server can not view or add events to their calendar. This issue is specific to [[Google Calendar]] users. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358?visit_id=636857341194425881-3060961537 & rd=2|title=See Google Calendar events on Apple Calendar - Computer - Calendar Help|website=support.google.com}} < /ref > 
 
 The release of Snow Leopard introduced several bugs into Snow Leopard, with regard to iCal alarms. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=903 |title=Apple - Support - Discussions - iCal |access-date=2009-12-21 |archive-date=2010-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114010423/http://discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=903 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  These problems include alarms not firing; < ref > http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=10310088{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  all alarms being set to one fixed date and time in the past, < ref > http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=10533200#10533200{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  preventing them from firing; alarms from repeat events being fired for all historic occurrences of that repeated event, resulting in dozens of alarms for one event. < ref > http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2140555 & start=0 & tstart=0{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Updates to Snow Leopard 10.6.1 and 10.6.2 have not addressed these problems. 
 
 iCal supports times zones, i.e.: if the function is enabled, and the computer's time zone changes, all the events in iCal are shifted to compensate for the time zone difference. The bug is that this function also occurs when it is turned off, therefore, whenever the computer's time zone changes, all the events in iCal shift as well.  < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/ical/topic4854.html|title=iCal: Timezones|website=www.macintouch.com|access-date=2019-02-14|archive-date=2012-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201011915/http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/ical/topic4854.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
