[[Hagar]] was an [[Egypt]]ian [[woman]] who was given as a [[servant]] to [[Abraham]]. When Abraham’s [[wife]] [[Sarah]] couldn’t have [[children]], Sarah told Abraham to marry Hagar. Then Abraham married Hagar and she became [[pregnant]] and then became [[arrogant]] so Sarah treated her badly and then she ran away but an [[angel]] told Hagar to go back to Abraham because the Almighty would be with her, [[help]] her and protect her. Hagar came back and gave birth to a [[son]], [[Ishmael]]. After Sarah gave birth to [[Isaac]], she told Abraham to [[banish]] both Hagar and her son. Then the Almighty told Abraham to listen to his [[wife]] Sarah, so Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away with [[water]] that they could use to survive.  When Ishmael got sick, Hagar gave him all the water she had and when she needed more for him, an [[angel]] gave it to her so she could save Ishmael. Ishmael then became the [[ancestor]] of the [[Ishmaelites]].
