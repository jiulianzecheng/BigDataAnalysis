 '''''Platybelodon''''' was an extinct type of four-tusked elephant. It is now placed in the  [[Amebelodontidae]], a sister group of the [[Gomphothere]]s. These were large [[herbivores]] related to modern [[elephants]]. They lived in wet forests in Africa, Asia and the [[Caucasus]]. 
 
 They are commonly known as  '''shovel tuskers'''. ''Platybelodon'' lived during the [[Miocene]], about 15{{ndash}}10 million years ago. < ref >  Agusti, Jordi and Anton. Mauricio 2002. ''Mammoths, sabertooths, and hominids''. Columbia University Press, p90. < /ref > 
 
 ==Palaeobiology== 
 ''Platybelodon'' was previously believed to have fed in the [[swamp]]y areas of grassy [[savanna]]s, using its teeth to shovel up [[aquatic]] and semi-aquatic vegetation.  
 
 However, wear patterns on the teeth suggest that it used its lower tusks to strip [[bark]] from [[tree]]s. They may have used the sharp [[incisor]]s that formed the edge of the  " shovel "  more like a modern-day [[scythe]], grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree. < ref name= " lambert1992 " > Lambert W.D. 1992.
