 '''Moulting''' (or '''molting''') is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off part of its body (usually the outer layer or covering) at particular times of year, or at specific points in its life cycle.  Moulting is also known as '''sloughing''', '''shedding''', or for some species, '''ecdysis'''. 
 
 Moulting can involve the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] (skin), and [[hair]], [[fur]], [[wool]], or other external layer. In some species, other body parts may be shed, for example, [[wing]]s in some [[insect]]s. Examples include old [[feather]]s in [[bird]]s, old [[hair]]s in [[mammal]]s (especially [[dog]]s and other [[canidae]]), old [[skin]] in [[reptile]]s, and the entire [[exoskeleton]] in [[arthropod]]s.

 == Ecdysis == 
 In [[arthropods]], such as [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s and [[crustacean]]s, moulting is the shedding of the [[exoskeleton]] (or [[Animal shell|shell]]).   
 
 This process of moulting is called '''ecdysis'''. It is the defining feature of a whole group of [[invertebrate]]s, the [[clade]] [[Ecdysozoa]]. < ref name= " Ewer " > {{cite journal |author=John Ewer |year=2005 |title=How the ecdysozoan changed its coat |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=e349 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030349 |pmid=16207077 |pmc=1250302 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  This group includes the [[arthropod]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[Onychophora|velvet worms]], [[Nematomorpha|horsehair worms]], [[rotifer]]s, [[tardigrade]]s and [[Cephalorhyncha]]. < ref name= " Tetlie " > {{cite journal |author=O.

 Ecdysis is part of the whole process of [[metamorphosis]]. The different stages (called 'instars') and the development of new 'apparatus' (such as sense organs) is necessary as the creature moves from one form to another. The new exoskeleton is initially soft but hardens after the moulting of the old exoskeleton.
