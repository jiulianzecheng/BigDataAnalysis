[[Corticosteroids]] such as [[prednisone]] are often used to treat sarcoidosis. In some cases, [[methotrexate]] may be also used. Anti[[malaria]] < nowiki/ > l drugs have also been used. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350358|title=Sarcoidosis - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic}} < /ref > 
 
 Sarcoidosis may involve the brain. If it does, it is called [[neurosarcoidosis]]. In some cases, [[pulmonary fibrosis]] is a [[complication]] of sarcoidosis.
