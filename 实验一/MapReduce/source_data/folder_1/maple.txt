 '''Maple''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] name ''Acer'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|s|ər}}) is a [[genus]] of [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s. Sometimes they are put into a family of their own, the [[Aceraceae]]. At other times they are included in the [[Sapindaceae]]. To include them in the Sapindaceae is the more modern classification. There are between 100 and 200 [[species]] of maples. Most species are native to [[Asia]], but some also occur in [[Europe]], [[Northern Africa]], and [[North America]].  
 
 The word ''Acer'' comes from a [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning  " sharp " . It was given because of the characteristic sharp points on the maple leaves. The first person to talk about the genus that way was [[French people|French]] botanist [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in 1700. The [[type species]] of the genus is ''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]'' (the sycamore maple). < ref name= " gelderen " > van Gelderen C.J.  &  van Gelderen D.M. 1999.

 == Seed dispersal ==  
 The maple's distinctive fruit are called samaras, and known by many children as  " helicopters "  by the way they spin as they fall. Inside the [[fruit]] are found their seeds, which are in pairs. Each one is enclosed in a  " nutlet "  attached to a flattened wing of papery tissue. They are shaped to spin as they fall and carry the seeds a considerable distance on the wind. One tree can release hundreds of thousands of seeds at a time. Some seeds can remain in the soil for several years before germinating. 
 
 == What are maples used for? == 
 Maple trees are often planted as ornamental trees in cities. Some species resist the cold rather well. [[Sugar maple]]s are grown to make [[maple syrup]]. Some maples are grown for [[timber]] (wood that is used for [[furniture]]). 
 
 == Symbolism == 
 The [[flag]] of [[Canada]] shows a maple leaf.
