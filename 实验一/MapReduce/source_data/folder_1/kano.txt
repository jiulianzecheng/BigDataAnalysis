'''Kano''' is a [[city]] in [[Nigeria]]. It is the capital of [[Kano State]]. Kano is the third largest city in Nigeria, after [[Ibadan]] and [[Lagos]]. About 3,626,204 people live in Kano. 
 
 It has long been the economic centre of northern Nigeria, and a centre for the sale of [[groundnut]]s. Kano is known for the Bayero University and a railway station with trains to Lagos and Port Harcourt, moving through [[Kaduna]], while Kano International Airport can be found nearby. Kano has long been a centre for Nigeria's [[Islam]]ic [[culture]]; one of the country's finest mosques lies in the city. 
 
 It is also the site where the Kano river project was developed.  This is a large irrigation scheme. 
 
 ==History== 
 The city of Kano was founded around [[A.D.]] [[1000]] as an [[Hausa]] city of its own. Kano remained a big emirate, or [[Islam|Muslim]] kingdom, until the birth of the country, Nigeria, in [[1903]]. Kano became known for its trade in [[gold]], [[leather]], [[ivory]], [[salt]] and [[slave]]s within the area. This perhaps is the reason for the city's [[money|wealth]] and power in the [[14th century]], when Islam gained a growing following. By the [[15th century]], the first Central Mosque had been built in the city.
