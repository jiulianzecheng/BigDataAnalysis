 The '''Minitel''' is a [[Videotex]] [[online service]]. Users connected to it through the [[telephone]] lines. It was a successful pre-[[World Wide Web]] online service. The PTT (Poste, Téléphone et Télécommunication) started Minitel started in [[France]] in 1982. From the beginning, users could buy things online that are now done on the [[Internet]]. People could make [[train]] reservations, check [[stock]] prices, search the [[telephone directory]], have a mail box, and chat. 
 
 In February 2009, [[France Telecom]] said the Minitel network still had 10 million monthly connections. One-million were to the directory.  France Telecom ended the service on 30 June 2012. < ref > {{cite news

 ==Business model== 
 [[File:Minitel-CnAM 44045-IMG 5396-gradient.jpg|thumb|1985 Alcatel Minitel terminal with non-AZERTY keyboard]] 
 Millions of [[computer terminal|terminal]]s were free to telephone subscribers. That meant many people and businesses had access immediately. People who got Minitel did not get a regular paper telephone directory. 
 
 Minitel gave access to these services: 
 * [[phone directory]] (free) 
 * mail-order retail companies 
 * [[airline]] or train ticket purchases 
 * information services 
 * [[databases]] 
 * [[message boards]] 
 
 Many new [[companies]] started to try to make money using the network.  This was like the later dot-com bubble.  Many of the companies failed. Some people criticized [[pornographic]] services on Minitel because children could access them. The government did not make rules about pornography on Minitel. The government also made a [[tax]] on pornographic online services. 
 
 ===Finances=== 
 Payment methods 
 *[[Credit card]] for purchases 
 *Telephone bill for surfing time: rates depended on the sites visited 
 
 France Télécom charged Minitel users at rates of up to [[euro|€]]1 a minute. The rates depend on the service called. Most services were much cheaper than the maximum. France Télécom then paid part of the fee to the companies that operate Minitel servers. 
 
 ===Phonebook=== 
 The most popular service of the Minitel was the  " Annuaire Electronique "  at the phone number  " 11 " . On 18 October 1996, access to the Phonedirectory changed to  " 3611 " . Companies could add up to 3 lines of information to the listing. There were also advertisements on the phone directory pages. 
 
 ==Terminals== 
 Minitel [[computer terminal|terminal]]s have a text based [[computer display|screen]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[modem]]. The screen can show simple graphics.  Minitel terminals use the [[AZERTY]] keyboard, not the [[QWERTY]] keyboard. Users could buy printers to attach to the terminals. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.acelgenesys.fr/html/pages/produits/imp_roul.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205233023/http://www.acelgenesys.fr/html/pages/produits/imp_roul.php |archivedate=February 5, 2009 |title=Imprimantes Rouleau Thermique |publisher=Acel Genesys}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Network== 
 The Minitel modem usually dialed a special number to connect to a PAVI (''Point d'Accès VIdéotexte'',  " videotext access point " ). The PAVI sent information to the correct servers on the [[Transpac (network)|Transpac]] [[X.25]] network. In France the most common dial number was  " 36 15 " .  " 36 17 "  was for more expensive services. Minitel services names often started with this number. So, the  " 36 15 "  number at the front of the name was like the  " .com "  on Internet web sites. 
 
 Minitel used a [[half-duplex]] asymmetric data rate via its modem.  It downlinked at 1200 bit/s and uplinked at 75 bit/s.  This allowed fast downloads, for the time. The system was called '1275', but the correct name was  [[V.23]]. This system was only for Minitel and copies of Minitel in other countries.
