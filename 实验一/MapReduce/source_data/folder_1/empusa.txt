'''Empousa''' or '''Empusa''' was a female spirit in [[Greek mythology]]. The origin of the figure is unclear. Her mother was probably [[Hecate|Hectate]]. Empousa seems to have been a spirit used to frighten people. In appearance, she probably resembled [[Mormo]] and Lamia. She seems to have had the ability to change her appearance or shape (known as [[shapeshifting]]). 
 
 One of the first to describe her was the Ancient Greek poet [[Aristophanes]], in his [[comedy]] [[The Frogs]]: When the Greek god [[Dionysus|Dionisus]] is on the way to the underworld with his slave Xanthias, Empusa appears in different forms (animals: [[Cattle|cow]], [[donkey]], [[dog]]), and finally as a woman. One of her legs is made of iron, the other is made of cow dung.
