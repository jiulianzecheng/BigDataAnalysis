 '''AZERTY''' is a [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]] [[layout]]. It is very similar to the [[QWERTY]] keyboard layout. It is mainly used in France and Belgium. 
 
 It is almost the same as the '''QWERTY''' keyboard, but it swaps the letter Q and A, as well as W and Z. The letter M is moved from right to N to the position of the semicolon on '''QWERTY''' keyboards.
