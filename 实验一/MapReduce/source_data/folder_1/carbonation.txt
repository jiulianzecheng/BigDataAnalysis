 '''Carbonation''' is the process of [[carbon dioxide]] [[Solvation|dissolving]] in a liquid. For example, carbon dioxide is added to flavored water under pressure to make it  " fizz "  as a [[carbonated water]] soft drink. 
 
 ==Geology== 
 When rain passes through the [[atmosphere]], it takes in or mixes with carbon dioxide, turning it into a weak carbonic acid.  When the rain falls in limestone, it dissolves the [[calcium carbonate]] in the rock, turning it into [[calcium bicarbonate]] and taking it away.  Holes and large cracks can form in the rock.  Such a place is called [[karst]].  If a stream or river passes through it, it could be swallowed up by a hole called a swallow hole.  It  can go through a series of underground caves and may appear on the surface again.  An example of a karst area is the [[Burren National Park]], in County Clare, Ireland. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/the_burren/burren_karst.htm |title=The Burren: Karst of Ireland  |work=clarelibrary.ie |year=2009 |access-date=10 November 2011}} < /ref >

 Carbon dioxide is weakly soluble in water, therefore it separates into a [[gas]]. The process of carbon dioxide bubbling out (effervescing) from a solution is represented by the following [[chemical reaction]]. This shows aqueous [[carbonic acid]] converts to carbon dioxide and water: 
 
 : < math >  \mbox{H}_2\mbox{CO}_3 \longrightarrow  \mbox{H}_2\mbox{O} + \mbox{CO}_2 < /math >

 Carbonation also describes the incorporation of carbon dioxide into chemical compounds. Carbon-based life originates from a carbonation reaction that is most often [[Catalysis|catalysed]] by the enzyme [[RuBisCO]]. This carbonation process is so important that a significant fraction of [[leaf]] mass consists of this carbonating enzyme. < ref > Stryer, Lubert; Berg, JeremyMark; Tymoczko, John L.
