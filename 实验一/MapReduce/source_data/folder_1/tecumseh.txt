 '''Tecumseh''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɪ|ˈ|k|ʌ|m|s|ə|,_|t|ɪ|ˈ|k|ʌ|m|s|i}} {{respell|ti|KUM|sə|,_|ti|KUM|see}}; March 1768  – October 5, 1813) was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] leader of the Shawnee and a large tribal confederacy (known as  [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]) which opposed the United States during [[Tecumseh's War]] and became an ally of Britain in the [[War of 1812]]. He is also the earliest known ruler of the [[Shawnee Tribe]].  
 
 ==Family== 
 Tecumseh had a brother named Tenskwatawa. Tenskwatawa was known as the town drunkard in the town until he changed and became religious. When Tecumseh left for a business trip and left Tenskwatawa in charge, he didn't do a good job. He started a war with his leadership, and a while after Tecumseh returned, Tecumseh was killed. Tecumseh also has a son named Cheeseekau.
