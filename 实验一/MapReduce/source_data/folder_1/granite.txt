 '''Granite''' is a kind of [[igneous rock]], found on [[Earth]] but nowhere else in the [[Solar System]]. < ref > [http://www.livescience.com/3070-exciting-evolution-rocks.html Andrea Thompson 2008. The exciting evolution of rocks. ''LiveScience''] < /ref > < ref > Rosing, Minik T. 2008. On the evolution of minerals. ''Nature'' '''456''' p457. < /ref >  It is formed from hot, molten [[magma]]. Its colour can be dark or light grey, brown, or even pink, according to the proportions of its [[minerals]]. It is called a plutonic rock because it forms under ground. 
 
 The magma is forced between other layers of rock by the pressure under the Earth's surface. The magma cools and turns slowly into solid stone. Granite has many different types of minerals in it. These include [[quartz]], [[feldspar]],  [[hornblende]], and sometimes [[mica]]. As the magma cools, these minerals form [[crystal]]s. The crystals can be seen easily if the granite is cut and polished. 
 
 Granite is a common stone on Earth, and makes up a big part of the [[Earth's crust|crust]] (the Earth's outer layer). It is usually found in the [[continental plate]]s of the Earth's crust. Although it forms under the surface of the Earth, there are many places where it has been forced upwards by [[Plate tectonics|tectonic movement]]. When plates in the Earth's crust move together, they get bent and pushed upwards. When this happens, granite [[mountain]]s can be formed. 
 
 == Origin == 
 Granite forms from silica-rich ([[felsic]]) [[magma]]s. It is the most abundant [[Basement (geology)|basement]] rock. It lies under the thin [[sedimentary rock]]s which cover the continents

 == Uses == 
 Granite is dense, and can be cut, carved and shaped. It is resistant to water and pollution, and has a range of different colours. < ref > Learn Science intermediate grades 5 to 6, by Mike Evans and Linda Ellis < /ref > 
 
 Kitchen benches are often made of polished granite. Granite is found in many countries of the world. Some countries have beautifully patterned granite which is quarried (cut in open mines) and sold for building material.
