 A '''centipede''' is a type of [[myriapod]] with many legs. Centipedes are [[predator]]s. They hunt during the night; they are [[nocturnal]].  Some centipedes are [[venomous]], but none can kill a person unless they are [[allergy|allergic]]. Centipedes are in the class '''Chilopoda''', and related to [[millipede]]s, which are not poisonous. As the millipedes, they are [[segmented]]. They have between 5 and 173 segments, but only one pair of legs per segment. There may be 8,000 species in the world. < ref > Adis, Joachim  &  Harvey, Mark S. 2000. How many Arachnida and Myriapoda are there worldwide and in Amazonia?. ''Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment'' '''35''' (2): 139â€“141. < /ref > 
 
 The [[house centipede]] is a [[carnivore]] that feeds on [[cockroach]]es, [[Musca|house flies]] and other domestic [[pest]]s. It is therefore beneficial. But because it has a scary appearance it is often exterminated.
