 '''Chichester''' is a small cathedral [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]], with a population of 26,795 (2011 Census). It is quite near the [[sea]], and near to a [[harbour]] for [[yachts]]. 
 
 The City of Chichester is [[twin town|twinned]] with: 
 * {{flagicon | France}} [[Chartres]], [[France]] 
 * {{flagicon | Italy}} [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]] 
 
 There are many buildings in the centre of Chichester which have interesting [[architecture]]. The oldest building is [[Chichester Cathedral]]. There are many beautiful houses in the Cathedral precincts. In many parts of the city one can still see the old city walls, and it is possible to walk along the top in some places. There is an old butter market dating from 1808. A century later another storey was added on top. 
 
 Just to the north of Chichester is the [[Goodwood]] race course. Many people go there in the summer to watch the [[horse race]]s. Goodwood is in the South Downs which is a beautiful area for walking. 
 
 Chichester is an old [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town. In the centre of Chichester are four main streets: North Street, South Street, East Street and West Street. These four streets meet in the centre, where there is a small round building with a cross: the Chichester cross. The four main streets form an area which is mostly [[pedestrian]]ized. [[Chichester Cathedral]] stands near the centre, between West Street and South Street. Further to the north lies the area of Summersdale and the [[conservation]] area around Graylingwell Hospital. South of Chichester is a [[canal]] which links the city to the sea. Soon after it was built in the 19th century the [[railway]] came to Chichester so that the canal was not used for long. The canal was left in a bad state for many years until, more recently, it was restored. Some of it can be used by small boats, and there are reedbeds where [[bird]]s can breed. 
 
 There is a Roman Museum near [[Fishbourne]], just west of the city, where many Roman remains can be seen, including a [[palace]] which once stood there. 
 
 Chichester is a [[Fairtrade]] City. Suppliers of Fairtrade are shown by a green dot in the web directory. 
 
 Because Chichester is so historic it has been divided into eight conservation areas. People are very anxious that the town should not lose its historic character.

 ==Transport== 
 Several [[road]]s lead into Chichester. The A27, which runs along the south coast, now [[Bypass (road)|bypasses]] the city. There are rail links to [[London]], [[Gatwick]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Southampton]] and [[Basingstoke]].
