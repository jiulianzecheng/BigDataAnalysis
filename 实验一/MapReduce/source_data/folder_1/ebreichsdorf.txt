 '''Ebreichsdorf''' is a town and surrounding '''Gemeinde''' (local community) south of [[Vienna]], in the district of [[Baden (district of Austria)|Baden]] in [[Lower Austria]] in [[Austria]]. 
 
 The '''Gemeinde''' had 11,422 people living in it at the beginning of 2021. Of those people, 5,381 were living in the town. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The town's name comes for Knight Eberich.  
 
 ==History== 
 
 People were already living in the area in the [[Bronze Age]] (about 3,000 years ago). Artifacts from that time include the Ebrrichsdorf gold treasure.  This includes a golden drinking vessel that was made in the same way as other cups from the [[Baltic Sea]] at the time.  It is decorated with a picture of the sun and its rays. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.heritagedaily.com/2021/10/discovery-of-a-lifetime-golden-sun-bowl-discovered-in-prehistoric-settlement/141559 | title= " Discovery of a lifetime "  golden sun bowl discovered in prehistoric settlement }} < /ref > 
 
 The beginnings of a castle were noted in AD 1157, < ref > August Landgraf (1973)  " DIE WASSERBURGEN DES 13. UND 14. JAHRHUNDERTS

 In the 18th century, making cotton and wool cloth was important, so people built a large [[water mill]] in Ebreichsdorf. 
 
 During the [[Second World War]], the castle was plundered. Between 1959 and 1963, it was rebuilt as a private residence. 
 
 In 2000, the area experienced an earthquake with a magnitude greater than 4.   < ref >  ) Maria-Theresia APOLONER , Jean-Baptiste TARY  &  Götz BOKELMANN (2015)  " Ebreichsdorf 2013 Earthquake Series: Relative Location, "  ''Austrian Journal of Earth Sciences'' 108/2: 199-208.
