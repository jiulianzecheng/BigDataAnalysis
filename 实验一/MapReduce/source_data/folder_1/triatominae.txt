The members of '''Triatominae''' are a [[subfamily]] of [[Assassin bug|Reduviidae]]. They are also called '''kissing bugs''', < ref > {{cite web|title=Triatominae|publisher=Iowa State University|url=http://bugguide.net/node/view/381676|access-date=Nov 26, 2015}} < /ref >  '''conenose bugs''', '''assassin bugs''' or '''triatomines'''. There are more than 130 species in this subfamily. Most of them feed on [[vertebrate]] blood. A few species feed on other [[invertebrate]]s. They are mainly found in the [[Americas]]. There are a few species in [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[Africa]].  
 
 Some of the bugs carry the [[Chagas disease]] parasite ''Trypanosoma cruzi''. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Kiss of Death: Chagas Disease|publisher=The University of Texas at Arlington|url=http://www.uta.edu/chagas|access-date=Nov 26, 2015}} < /ref >  However, only those species (such as ''Triatoma infestans'' and Rhodnius prolixus) well [[adaptation|adapted]] to living with humans are considered important [[vector (biology)|vectors]].
