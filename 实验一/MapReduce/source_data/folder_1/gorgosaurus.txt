 '''''Gorgosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in western [[North America]] during the [[Upper Cretaceous]], between about 76.5 and 75 million years ago. 
 
 Fossil remains have been found in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Alberta]] and possibly the U.S. state of [[Montana]]. It was closely related to ''[[Tyrannosaurus|T. rex]]'' and ''[[Albertosaurus]]''. ''Gorgosaurus'', like ''T. rex'', had huge jaws with large, sharp, cone-shaped teeth, powerful legs, tiny arms and two-fingered hands. 
 
 ''Gorgosaurus'' lived in a lush [[floodplain]] environment along the edge of an [[inland sea]]. It was an [[apex predator]]: it preyed on  [[ceratopsid]]s and [[hadrosaur]]s.  
 
 ''Gorgosaurus'' spent as much as half its life in the juvenile phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. < ref name= " ericksonetal2004 " > Erickson, Gregory M.

 Most specimens of ''Gorgosaurus libratus'' have been recovered from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] in [[Alberta]]. This formation was laid down in the later Cretaceous, between 76.5 and 74.8 & nbsp;million years ago. < ref > Eberth D.A. (2005).  " The geology. "  In: Currie P.J. and Koppelhus E.B.
