 == History == 
 The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game in 1930. Insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. ''Allstate Insurance Company'', named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog. < ref name= " Encyclopedia " > {{cite web|title=Encyclopedia- Allstate Corp.|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/The_Allstate_Corp.aspx|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628234217/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/The_Allstate_Corp.aspx|archive-date=2011-06-28|access-date=2011-02-23|publisher=Encyclopedia.com}} < /ref >
