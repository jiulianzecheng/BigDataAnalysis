 '''Freetown''' is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of the [[Africa]]n [[country]] of [[Sierra Leone]]. With a [[population]] of  951,000 people, it is the largest [[city]] in that country. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://statistics.sl/2014_population_and_housing_census_tables.pdf |title=Account Suspended |publisher= }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The city is a [[harbor|port]] on the [[Freetown Peninsula]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. The port is a very important part of the [[economy]] of Freetown. It handles the main [[export]]s of the country. [[Industry|Industries]] include [[fish]], [[rice]], [[petroleum]], and making [[cigarette]]s. 
 
 == History == 
 The area was first settled in 1787 by 400 freed former [[Slavery|slaves]] and [[African-American|Black American]] [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s sent from [[London]]. Many of these men had joined the [[British Army]] because the British promised to free them if they fought the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonist]]s. Before that time it was said to be a [[slave trade|slave market]]. These people created the 'Province of Freetown' on land bought from local [[Temne people|Temne]] leaders. After many of these original [[settler]]s died from [[disease]], it was burnt by the local people in 1790. 
 
 The [[Sierra Leone Company]] tried to settle the area again in 1792. They resettled Freetown with 1,100 former slaves and Loyalists from [[Nova Scotia]]. Many of these people were born in the [[colony|colonial]] [[United States]]. They were led by former slave [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]]. Around 500 free [[Jamaica]]n [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]] joined them in 1800. 
 
 The city survived being [[wikt:attack|attacked]] by the [[France|French]] in 1794. In 1800 the people [[revolution|revolted]] but the [[United Kingdom|British]] retook control.  From 1808 to 1874, the city was the capital of [[British West Africa]].  The city grew quickly as many freed slaves came to live there. African [[soldier]]s who had fought for Britain in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] also came to live in Freetown.  During [[World War II]], Britain had a [[Royal Navy|naval]] base at Freetown.  [[Descendant]]s of the freed slaves, called [[Creole peoples|Creoles]], have a large role in the city, even though they are only a small amount of the population. 
 
 The city had much fighting in the late 1990s. In 1998, it was captured by [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] soldiers who were trying to make [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] the [[President]] again. 
 
 == Features == 
 One of Freetownâ€™s most most known features is its famous [[Cotton Tree|cotton tree]]. The cotton tree is said to have been in the same position since [[colony|colonists]] came to the area in 1787. At that time, the tree was still a young sapling. It now stands outside the Freetown Museum. 
 
 Notable [[building]]s in the city include [[Freetown Law Courts]], the [[Slave Gate]] and [[Portuguese Steps]], [[St John's Maroon Church]] (built around 1820), [[St George's Cathedral (Freetown)|St George's Cathedral]] (completed in 1828), [[Foulah Town Mosque]] (built in the 1830s) and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Freetown)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].  Also in Freetown are many [[beach]]es and [[market]]s, and the [[Sierra Leone Museum]]. 
 
 The city is the home of [[Fourah Bay College]] and the [[Njala University college]]. 
 
 [[Lungi International Airport]]  is the [[international]] [[airport]] of Sierra Leone. Freetown also has a [[heliport]] on [[Aberdeen, Sierra Leone|Aberdeen]] [[Island]]. It connects the city with the airport.  There is a [[helicopter]], [[hovercraft]] and [[ferry]]-service from the city to the airport.
