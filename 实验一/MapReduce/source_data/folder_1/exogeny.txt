 '''Exogeny''' refers to coming from the outside. People, planets, computers, and anything else can be influenced either by things in its [[environment]] or by things within itself. Things from within itself are indigenous. 
 
 The [[Earth]] is shaped by many [[Geology|geological]] processes. The [[Force (physics)|forces]] that make these things happen come from both inside and outside the Earth. 
 
 In [[geology]], '''exogenous''' processes come from forces ''on or above'' the Earth's surface. Processes caused by forces from ''within'' the Earth are '''endogenous''' processes. ''Exo'' is a prefix meaning  " out " , and ''endo'' is a [[prefix]] meaning  " in " . 
 
 Many exogenous (extraterrestrial) forces are caused by other bodies in the [[Solar System]]. For example, the [[Moon]] causes [[tide]]s in the Earth's [[oceans]] and other big bodies of water. Impacts from [[comet]]s and [[meteoroid]]s change the surface of the Earth. When they strike the Earth, they make [[crater]]s in the ground. 
 
 The [[Sun]] is the main exogenous influence in the Solar System. It has many effects on Earth. [[Radiation]] from the [[Sun]] is a main cause of the surface temperature of the Earth, and for the growth of plant life. We are partly shielded from the Sun's [[solar wind]] by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Storms of solar particles would otherwise strip away the [[ozone layer]] which protects us from [[ultraviolet radiation]]. Sometimes we see [[aurora]]e, which are lights that can be seen at night near the [[Geographical pole|poles]]. 
 
 An example of an exogenous process that is not as a result of bodies in space is [[erosion]]. Erosion is mostly made by precipitation such as [[rain]] and [[snow]], and by [[wind]].  
 
 There are three main endogenous geological processes: [[fold (geology)|folding]], [[faulting]] and [[volcanism]]. They take place mainly along the [[Tectonic plate|plate boundaries]]. These are the zones on the edges of plates. Endogenous processes cause many major [[landform]] features.
