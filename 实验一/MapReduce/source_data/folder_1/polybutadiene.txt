 '''Polybutadiene''' is a [[polymer]], that is mainly used as [[synthetic]] [[rubber]]: It is made from the [[monomer]] [[1,3-Butadiene]]. Polybutadiene has a high resistance to wear. About 70% of the production is used for [[tire]]s. About 25% is used as an [[additive]] to improve the toughness (impact resistance)  of plastics such as [[polystyrene]] and [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS). Polybutadiene rubber accounted for about a quarter of total global consumption of synthetic rubbers in 2012. < ref > {{cite web|title=Market Study Synthetic Rubber|url=http://www.ceresana.com/de/marktstudien/kunststoffe/synthetischer-gummi/|publisher=Ceresana|date=June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318064805/http://www.ceresana.com/de/marktstudien/kunststoffe/synthetischer-gummi/|archive-date=2015-03-18}} < /ref >  It is also used to manufacture [[golf ball]]s, various elastic objects and to coat or encapsulate electronic assemblies, offering high electrical [[resistivity]]. < ref > Heinz-Dieter Brandt, Wolfgang Nentwig, Nicola Rooney, Ronald T.
