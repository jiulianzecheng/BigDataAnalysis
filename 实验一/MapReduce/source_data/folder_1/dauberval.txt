 '''Jean Bercher''' (known as '''Dauberval''' or '''D'Auberval'''; Montpellier, August 19, 1742 - Tours, February 14, 1802) was a French ballet dancer and [[choreographer]]. He was a pupil of [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] and made his debut at the [[Paris Opéra]] on June 12, 1762. He was a superb mime. He choreographed few ballets, but is credited with creating the comedy ballet. His best known work is ''[[La Fille mal gardée]]'', which is one of the oldest ballets still performed.
