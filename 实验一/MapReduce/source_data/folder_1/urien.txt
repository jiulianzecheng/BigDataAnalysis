 '''Urien''' often referred to as '''Urien Rheged''' or '''Uriens''', was a late 6th-century king of Rheged, an early British kingdom of the Hen Ogledd (today's northern England and southern Scotland). His power and his victories, including the battles of Gwen Ystrad and Alt Clut Ford, are celebrated in the praise poems to him by Taliesin, preserved in the ''Book of Taliesin''. He became the  " King Urien of Gorre "  of later Arthurian legend and his son Owain mab Urien was later known as Ywain.
