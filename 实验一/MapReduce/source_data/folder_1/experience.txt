'''Experience''' is knowledge a person gets by doing something or watching someone else do it.  Experience is [[learning]] through actions.  
 
 Some [[religion|religious]] groups and teaching methods value learning by experiencing. 
 For example, if someone wants to learn about the game [[chess]], they would play several games. By making [[error|mistake]]s and learning from them, they learn more rather than just [[read]]ing about playing. 
 
 ==Types of experience== 
 Experience is often divided into four types:

 Someone who experienced by watching or doing something himself is said to have ''first-hand experience''. 
 
 When one person tells another person, the other person has ''second-hand experience''. 
 
 When an experience is felt or enjoyed through imagined participation, the person has had a  " ''vicarious experience'' " . 
 
 A [[religious]] experience is a [[spiritual]] event seen by someone. [[Holy]] books like the [[Bible]] talk about [[vision]]s or [[dream]]s where men like [[Moses]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] or [[Jesus]] met [[God]]. [[mysticism|Mystics]] also describe these events, and offer advice. [[William James]] wrote a famous book about the kinds of religious experience. 
 
 == Proverbs about Experience== 
 *  " Only the foolish learn from experience â€” the wise learn from the experience of others. "  [[Romania]]n [[proverb]]. (Fools go out, make their own mistakes and learn from them. Smart people learn from others' mistakes.) 
 *  " Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other. "  [[Benjamin Franklin]] (Fools refuse to learn in school from textbooks or teachers. Fools choose to learn only from their own mistakes. They will not learn in a school classroom.) or (Experience is a great teacher and teaches many of life's most important lessons, but only fools will refuse to get new knowledge in other ways too. Examples of other ways to learn things are listening, reading, remembering, and reasoning.)
