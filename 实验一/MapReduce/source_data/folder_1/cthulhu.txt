 '''Cthulhu''' is a [[fiction]]al [[deity]] created by the horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Cthulhu is a powerful monster from another planet. It (Cthulhu is neither [[male]] nor [[female]]) is very ancient compared to humans, being around since the dinosaurs. It has the alien appearance of a large green [[dragon]] with the head of an octopus and human-like hands. There are said to be many people who worship it as their deity because of their powers over the [[mind]]. 
 
 Cthulhu is one of the Great Old Ones, a group of powerful beings from another place that now inhabit Earth, waiting to rise up (when the stars are right) and destroy the [[human]] race so they can rule the planet. The Old Ones are neither good nor evil, meaning that they do not hate humans, they just do not care about them. They think of humans as if they could be [[ants]]. Also, their appearance is so unlike anything of this world, that it is said that any human who so much as gazes upon one of them will go insane. 
 
 In one of Lovecraft's stories, ''The Call of Cthulhu'', he said that Cthulhu currently lies in a dreamlike state in the underwater sunken city of R'lyeh (rill-ee-yeh), waiting for the time when the Old Ones shall rise again. In the story, R'lyeh is located in the southern Pacific Ocean.
