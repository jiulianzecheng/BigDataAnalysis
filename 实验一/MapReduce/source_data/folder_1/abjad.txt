An '''abjad''' is an [[alphabet]] in which all of the [[Letter|letters]] are [[Consonant|consonants]]. Even though [[Vowel|vowels]] can be added in some abjads, they are not needed to write a word correctly. Abjad are commonly written from right to left, rather than left to right, like in other [[writing system|writing systems]]. Well-known examples of abjads are the [[Arabic alphabet]] and the [[Hebrew language#Alphabet|Hebrew alphabet]]. 
 
 Abjads are the first writing systems that were made to show only a word's pronunciation, instead of its meaning, unlike [[Ideogram|ideographs]] or [[Ideogram|ideograms]], and were created before full alphabets like the [[Greek alphabet]], which have letters for both consonants and vowels. 
 
 The earliest known abjad in the world is the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. Since in [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic languages]], the root meaning of a word is found in its consonants, abjads are widely used in those languages. There are also languages without consonant roots that use abjads, such as [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]], both of which use the Arabic alphabet.
