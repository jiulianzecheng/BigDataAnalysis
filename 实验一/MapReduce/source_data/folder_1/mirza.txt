 It is derived from a historical  [[Title role]] of Persian origin (Mīrzā), denoting the rank of a [[royal]]  [[prince]] , high [[nobleman]] , or a military commander equivalent to a nobleman. It is usually defined in English as [[Prince of the blood]]. 
 
 Specifically, it was used as a title by and today signifies patriarchal lineage to the various [[Persian Empire]]s, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Shirvanshahs]] and Circassians of the Caucasus, [[Mughal Empire]] or [[Muslim]] [[Rajput]]s of the [[South Asia|Indian Subcontinent]].[2] It was also a title bestowed upon members of the highest aristocracies in [[Tatars|Tatar]] states, such as the Khanates of [[Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan]]. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 The word Mīrzā is derived from the Persian term ‘Amīrzāde which literally means  " Son of the Amīr "  or  " child of the ruler " .[3] ‘Amīrzād in turn consists of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] title ‘Amīr (english: Emir), meaning  " commander "  and  " Prince " , and the Persian suffix -zād, meaning  " birth "  or  " lineage " . Due to vowel harmony in [[Turkic languages]], the alternative pronunciation [[Mortar (weapon)]] (plural morzalar; derived from the [[Persian]] word) is also used. The word Mirza means royalty in almost every old version of Persian, Arab, Caucasian, Turkish and Indian languages. 
 
 Variant spellings in English include mirzya, miriza, mirize, mirze, morsey, mursay, murse, meirsa, mirzey, mursi, murze, murza, mirza, myrza, meerza . 
 
 == Royal title == 
 The titles themselves were given by the [[King]], [[Sultan]] and [[Emperor]] (equivalent to the western [[Fount of honour]]) to their sons and grandsons, or even distant kins. Noblemen loyal to the kings also received this Title. 
 The title itself is derived from the title Emir. Emir, meaning  " commander "  or  " Prince " , is derived from the Semitic root  " Amr " , meaning  " command " . Originally it simply meant  " commander "  or  " leader " , usually in reference to a group of people. It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word  " Prince. "  The word entered English in 1595, from the French émir. It is also used in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]] by ''[[Muslim]] [[Rajput]]s''.
