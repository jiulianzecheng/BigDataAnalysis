 '''Scleractinia''', also called '''stony corals''' or '''hard corals''', an [[order (biology)|order]] in the [[Cnidaria]]. It contains the [[polyps]] which build most [[coral reef]]s.  
 
 Most of these corals are [[colony (biology)|colonial]]. They secrete [[calcium carbonate]], the base of every reef. Very often, the corals form a [[symbiosis]] with unicellular [[dinoflagellates]]. These [[zooxanthellae]] are usually of the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Symbiodinium]]''.  
 
 The closest relatives to stony corals are the [[sea anemone]]s. Stony corals are only distantly related to [[fire coral]]s and [[soft corals]]. There are about 1500 [[species]], in 35 [[family (biology)|families]].
