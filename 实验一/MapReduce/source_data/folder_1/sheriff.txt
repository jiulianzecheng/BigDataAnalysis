 A '''sheriff''' is generally a [[legal]] official with responsibility for a [[county|county or parish]]. The duties of a sheriff vary from country to country. The term comes from [[Anglo-Norman]] [[England|English]]. The [[king]]s officer in each [[shire]] was called a  " shire-reeve " . His function was to enforce the king's law in the shire or county.  
 
 == History == 
 
 The term shire reeve appears in [[document]]s in England in the early [[11th century]]. < ref > William Alfred Morris, ''The Medieval English Sheriff to 1300'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press; New York: Barnes  &  Noble, 1968), p. 1 < /ref >  When [[William the Conqueror]] conquered England in 1066, he kept most of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] sheriffs. < ref name=Stenton623.633 > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', Third Edition (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), pp. 623, 633 < /ref >  When William abolished the great Anglo-Saxon [[Earl|Earldoms]], the sheriff became the immediate representative of the king in the county. < ref name=Stenton623.633/ >  His appointment was typically for one year. He held court where he punished minor offenders. < ref name=Chapin95 > Bradley Chapin, ''Criminal Justice in Colonial America, 1606-1660'' (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2010), p. 95 < /ref >  Later, his powers were reduced to [[arrest]]ing and imprisoning [[criminal]]s.  
 
 ===Colonial America=== 
 
 When the American colonies began to grow, Britain established political control. < ref name=FCS > {{cite web |url=http://www.fcso-ma.us/origins-of-the-sheriffs-office.html |title=History of Sheriff's Office |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Franklin County Sheriff's Office, Franklin County, MA |accessdate=9 July 2014 |archive-date=2 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502024240/http://www.fcso-ma.us/origins-of-the-sheriffs-office.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   As each colony established counties, a sheriff was appointed to keep law and order. < ref name=FCS/ >  He was also an officer of the British court. The sheriff had different titles in different colonies. In [[Rhode Island]] he was called a general [[sergeant]]. < ref name=Chapin95/ >  In [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]] the title was Marshal. In [[Plymouth Colony]] he was called a messenger. < ref name=Chapin95/ >   In the later colonial period, sheriffs were appointed by the colonial [[governor]]. They collected taxes, testified in court and served [[subpoena]]s. Because they were paid per task, and tax collecting paid the most, enforcing the law became a lower priority. < ref > ''Critical Issues in Crime and Justice: Thought, Policy, and Practice'', eds. Mary Maguire; Dan Okada (Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011), p. 184 < /ref > 
 
 After the [[American Revolutionary War]] sheriffs were elected by the people. < ref name=FCS/ > 
 
 === 17th and 18th century America === 
 
 In the American west, the [[Spain|Spanish]] were colonizing what would become [[Texas]], [[California]]. < ref name=Maguire185 > ''Critical Issues in Crime and Justice: Thought, Policy, and Practice'', eds. Mary Maguire; Dan Okada (Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011), p. 185 < /ref >  The equivalent of the sheriff was called an [[Alguacil]] (sheriff/constable). < ref name=Maguire185/ >  As Americans moved west, they often started new communities.

Roth; James Stuart Olson, ''Historical Dictionary of Law Enforcement'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2001), p. 320 < /ref >  Sheriffs had the power of ''[[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]]''. That means a sheriff had the power to [[deputize]] anyone to help him keep the peace or go after and [[arrest]] criminals. < ref name=Roth320/ >  A group of temporary deputies under the authority of a sheriff is called a posse. As America grew the posse was used less and less.{{efn|The sheriff's posse lives on in organizations like the [[Pima County Sheriff's Posse]]. < ref name=SARC > {{cite web |url=http://www.sarci.org/posse.htm |title=Pima County Sheriff's Posse |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=26 February 2013 |website= |publisher=Search And Rescue Council, Inc |accessdate=9 July 2014 |archive-date=27 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527082229/http://www.sarci.org/posse.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This group of mounted volunteers was formed in 1946.

 == Modern sheriffs == 
 === United States === 
 
 In many [[States of the United States|states]] the sheriff remains the highest [[rank]]ing county [[law enforcement]] officer. < ref name=Kess23 > ''Introduction to Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice'', eds. KÃ¤ren Hess, Christine Hess Orthmann (Clifton Park, NY: Delmar/Cengage Learning, 2012), p. 23 < /ref >  Each state decides what powers the sheriff will have. In some states the sheriff is a court officer and law enforcement is left to the [[police]]. In other states they are charged with enforcing laws, investigate crimes, transport prisoners and operate [[jail]]s. < ref name=Kess23/ >  A sheriff can appoint [[Deputy|deputies]]. < ref name=Kess23/ >  A small sheriff's department might be run by a sheriff alone. A large sheriff's department could have hundreds of deputies and [[civilian]] [[employee]]s. < ref name=Kess23/ >  The main difference between a sheriff's office and a police department is that the sheriff usually operates [[prison|correctional facilities]] and county civil functions. < ref name=Kess23/ >
