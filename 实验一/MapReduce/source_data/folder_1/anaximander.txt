 '''Anaximander''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ˌ|n|æ|k|s|ɪ|ˈ|m|æ|n|d|ər}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀναξίμανδρος}} ''Anaximandros''; c. 610 – c. 546 BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher who lived in [[Miletus]], < ref name=Chambers > " Anaximander "  in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 403. < /ref >  a city of [[Ionia]]. He belonged to the [[Milesian school]] and learned the teachings of his master [[Thales]]. He succeeded him and became the second master of that school where he counted [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and [[Pythagoras]] amongst his pupils. < ref > Guthrie W.K.C. 1962. ''A history of Greek philosophy''. Vol 1: the earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans. Cambridge. < /ref > 
 
 Little of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies, < ref > Themistius, ''Oratio'' 36, § & nbsp;317 < /ref >  although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.
