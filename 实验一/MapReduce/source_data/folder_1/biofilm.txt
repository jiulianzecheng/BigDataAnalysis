A '''biofilm''' is any group of [[microorganism]]s which stick to [[cell (biology)|cell]] surfaces. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1= López|first1= Daniel|last2= Vlamakis|first2= Hera|last3= Kolter|first3= Roberto|date= 2010|title= Biofilms|journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|volume= 2|issue= 7|page= a000398|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a000398|issn= 1943-0264|pmc= 2890205|pmid= 20519345}} < /ref > 
 
 These sticky cells create a [[mucus|slimy]] layer outside the cells of the body. The cells in the biofilm produce  extracellular [[polysaccharide]]s, [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[DNA]]. < ref name= " :5 " > {{cite journal |last1= Aggarwal |first1= S|last2= Stewart |first2= P|last3=  Hozalski |first3= R |date= 2016 |title= Biofilm Cohesive Strength as a Basis for Biofilm Recalcitrance: Are Bacterial Biofilms Overdesigned?|journal= Sage Journals |volume= 8 (suppl 2)|issue= Suppl 2|pages= 29–32 |doi= 10.4137/MBI.S31444 |pmid= 26819559|pmc= 4718087}} < /ref >  Because they have three-dimensional structure they are a community lifestyle for microorganisms.

 The biofilm bacteria can share [[nutrients]] and are sheltered from harmful factors in their local environment, such as [[desiccation]], [[antibiotics]], and the host's [[immune system]]. The film of bacteria which live on your teeth are an example. Biofilms also form on inorganic objects like stones in water.
