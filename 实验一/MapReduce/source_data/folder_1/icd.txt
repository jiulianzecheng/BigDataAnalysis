The '''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems''' (also known as '''ICD''') is a list of [[Code|codes]] that classify [[disease]]s and medical problems. A special, unique code is given to: 
 *Every medical [[condition]] (including [[mental illness|mental health problems]]) 
 *Specific [[symptom]]s, if it is not clear what condition is causing the symptom. (For example, if a person has a [[cough]], but the doctor does not know why, he would just use the ICD code for  " Cough " .) 
 *Changes in the body, or test results that are not normal (if it is not clear what condition is causing these changes). 
 *[[Injury|Injuries]] or [[illness]]es that are caused by things outside of the body (for example, [[fracture|broken bones]], [[burn]]s, and [[poison]]ings) 
 *Social issues that may cause health problems (for example, if a person's job causes health risks, or if the person's health is at risk because of [[poverty]]) 
 
 ICD is published by the [[World Health Organization]]. One of the ICD's goals is to make sure that different doctors - and different countries - are using the same diagnoses. This makes it easier to compare how diseases affect different countries.  
 
 The ICD has been changed and updated many times. The most recent edition is the ICD-11. ICD-11 has been adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]] of WHO for use starting  1 January 2022 < ref name= " WHO ICD-11 News " > [https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/25-05-2019-world-health-assembly-update World Health Assembly news May 2019] < /ref >  It has been revised using [[Web 2.0]]. < ref name=Wikipedia > [http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/05/02/disease-wiki.html WHO adopts Wikipedia approach for key update < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >
