 '''Sofiensaal''' (or '''Sofiensäle''') is the name of a former public [[bath]] and [[concert]] [[venue]] in [[Vienna]]. It was built as a public bath in the years 1845-1848 by [[Eduard van der Nüll]] and [[August Sicard von Sicardsburg]]. It was used as a bath in winter. During the summer, the swimming pool was covered with wooden planks. The venue could then be used for concerts, and as a dance venue. In [[March]] [[1912]] [[Karl May]] gave his last public speech there. He had an audience of about 2000 people. In September 1913, the first movies that had sound were shown in the building. This was later stopped however, as there were problems with making sure the sound was at the right time in the movie (called [[synchronization|synchronicity]]).  
 
 In May 1938, [[Richard Suchenwirth]] founded the [[NSDAP]] Austria section there. During the war, the venue was used to collect the [[Jew]]s (who were later [[deportation|deported]]). The building was restored to its former glory by [[Carl Appel]] in [[1948]]. In the 1950, [[DECCA]] installed the most modern recording studio in Europe in the rooms. The studio was used until the 1970s, to make recordings of the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]], amongst others. 
 
 In the 1990s, it was used as a clubbing venue. 
 
 It was burned down in a fire in 2001, but was rebuilt and reopened in 2013.
