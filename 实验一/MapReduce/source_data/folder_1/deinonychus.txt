 '''''Deinonychus'''''  < ref > ''pronounced:dei-ON-ike-US'' < /ref >  was a medium [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]. It was a [[dromaeosaur]], and also a larger relative of the famous ''[[Velociraptor]]''. This 3.4 meter (11 & nbsp;ft) long ''Deinonychus'' lived during the [[Lower Cretaceous]], about 115-108 million years ago. Fossils have been found in the U.S. states of [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Oklahoma]]. 
 
 ''Deinonychus'' is perhaps the single most important dinosaur discovered in the mid 20th century. < ref > Fastovsky D.E; Weishampel D.B. 2005.  " Theropoda I: Nature red in tooth and claw " .

 ==Ostrom's analysis== 
 [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[John Ostrom]]'s study of ''Deinonychus'' in the late 1960s started the debate on whether dinosaurs were [[warm-blooded]]. < ref > Desmond A.J. 1977. ''The hot-blooded dinosaurs''. {{ISBN|0-8600-7494-3}} < /ref >  It is now accepted that all or most smaller theropods had [[feather]]s whose function was [[temperature regulation]]. Ostrom noted the small body, sleek, horizontal, posture, and the enlarged claws on the feet, which suggested the animal was an active, agile predator. < ref name =  " ostrom1970 " > {{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=J. H.|year=1970|title=Stratigraphy and paleontology of the Cloverly Formation(Lower Cretaceous) of the Bighorn Basin area, Wyoming and Montana |journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History|volume=35|pages=1–234}} < /ref >  Before this, the popular idea of dinosaurs had been one of plodding, reptilian giants. < ref > Bakker, Robert T. 1975. Dinosaur Renaissance, in ''Scientific American'', April issue. < /ref > < ref > Bakker, Robert T. 1986. ''The Dinosaur heresies: new theories unlocking the mystery of the dinosaurs and their extinction''. Zebra Books. < /ref > 
 
 ''Deinonychus'' means 'Terrible [[claw]]'. This refers to the large, sickle-shaped claw bone on the second toe of each hind foot. In life, a horny sheath over this bone extended the length. Ostrom reconstructed the claw as over {{convert|120|mm|in}} long. < ref name= " ostrom1970 " / > 
 
 The species name ''antirrhopus'' means “counter balance”. This refers to Ostrom's idea that the [[tail]] balanced the front of the body. As in other dromaeosaurs, the tail vertebrae have ossified (bony) [[tendons]] and super-long bone processes. These features seemed to make the tail into a stiff counter[[balance]]. A [[fossil]] of the closely related ''[[Velociraptor]]'' has an connected tail skeleton that is curved side to side in a long S–shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could swish to the sides with some flexibility. < ref name=norellmakovicky1999 > {{cite journal |last1=Norell |first1=Mark A. |last2=Makovicky|first2= Peter J. |year=1999 |title=Important features of the dromaeosaurid skeleton II: information from newly collected specimens of ''Velociraptor mongoliensis'' |journal=American Museum Novitates |issue=3282 |pages=1–45 |hdl=2246/3025 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/3025}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Paleoecology== 
 ''Deinonychus'' remains have been found near those of the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Teeth discovered near  ''Tenontosaurus'' specimens suggest it was hunted or at least scavenged by ''Deinonychus''.
