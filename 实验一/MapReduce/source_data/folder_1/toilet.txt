 A '''toilet''' is a place where [[human]]s get rid of [[waste]] that comes from their [[human body|bodies]] ([[urine]] and [[feces]]). Most toilets use [[water]] to [[flush]] the waste through [[plumbing]] into a [[sewage system]]. However, some modern toilets do not use water, and are called dry toilets. 
 
 A room that has a toilet can be called a  " [[restroom]] "  or  " [[bathroom]] "  in the [[United States]]. In other places it may be called the toilet or the water closet (WC). 
 
 == Toilets in homes ==

 Almost all modern buildings have at least one toilet. In the home, a toilet may or may not be in the same room as a [[shower]] or a [[bathtub]]. Some toilets are outside, in an  " outhouse " . 
 
 In developing countries, many people do not have a toilet in their home. More than 4.5 billion people do not have access to toilets. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/11/09/666150842/why-did-bill-gates-give-a-talk-with-a-jar-of-human-poop-by-his-side | title=Why Did Bill Gates Give a Talk with a Jar of Human Poop by His Side? | website=NPR | date=9 November 2018 | last1=Yu | first1=Katrina }} < /ref >

 A public toilet may or may not cost money to use. Toilets that cost money are called  " [[pay toilet]]s " . 
 
 Public bathrooms often have many toilets with walls between them. This makes areas called ''stalls'' (US) or ''cubicles'' (UK). Bathrooms for men often also have separate [[urinal]]s. Urinals can either be on the wall for a single user, or a [[basin]] or [[trough]] for many men to use at the same time. Urinals on walls sometimes have small walls or dividers for privacy reasons. 
 
 Outdoor public toilets (in the street, around parks, etc.) are a form of street [[furniture]]. These toilets are in individual cubicles. Some are simple and have little or no [[plumbing]]. Others are less simple, and some toilets even clean themselves after every use. 
 
 Some toilet-cubicles are mobile and can be put in place where and when they are needed. These toilets are called  " portable toilets " . Portable toilets are commonly used at large outdoor events like [[concert]]s, [[festival]]s or [[carnival]]s. 
 
 == Inventions == 
 In 1775, Alexander Cumming patented the S-bend. This was crucial in the development of the flushing toilet. It was a simple length of pipe with a curve in it.

 Every day, toilets use 141 billion liters of water to flush waste. Engineers try to make toilets that do not need so much water. In 2019, one group made a chemical to put in  toilets to make them more slippery so that the waste flushes away with only a little water. < ref name=SciAm > {{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/superslippery-toilets-squash-water-wastage/|title=Superslippery toilets squash water wastage |author=Vivianne Callier|publisher=Scientific American|date=November 18, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}} < /ref > < ref name=Eureka > {{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/ps-nst111419.php|title=New, slippery toilet coating provides cleaner flushing, saves water|author=Penn State|publisher=Eurekalert|date=November 18, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}} < /ref >
