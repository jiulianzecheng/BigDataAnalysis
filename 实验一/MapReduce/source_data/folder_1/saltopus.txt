 '''''Saltopus''''' was a small, lightly-built [[Upper Triassic]] [[reptile]]. So few bones were found that its exact nature is not known.  
 
 It was 60 centimeters (23 in) long, not much bigger than a rabbit, and was discovered in [[Scotland]] by Friedrich von Huene in 1910.  
 
 It was a carnivore. Not much more can be said until more remains are discovered.
