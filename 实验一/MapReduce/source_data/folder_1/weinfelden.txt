 == History == 
 === Early history === 
 Already in the year 124 AD, there was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bridge over the [[Thur]] at Weinfelden. The name ''Weinfelden'' is first documented in 838. 
 
 Weinfelden was by far the biggest town in the canton of Thurgau. In 1798, [[Paul Reinhart (Swiss politician)|Paul Reinhart]] and his committee led the area to freedom from the domination of the ''[[Eidgenosse]]n''. In 1803, Thurgau became an independent canton, through the mediation of [[Napoleon]], with [[Frauenfeld]] as capital. 
 
 === Modern history === 
 In 1830, [[Thomas Bornhauser]] spoke to a large crowd in Weinfelden, demanding a liberal constitution for the canton. It is one of the first (if not the first) such document. 
 
 Portraits of both Paul Reinhart and Thomas Bornhauser hang in the ''Rathaus''.
