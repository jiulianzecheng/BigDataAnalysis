 '''Kidnapping''' is an [[illegal]] act of [[stealing]] [[people]]. It has been around for a long time. For example, there were [[slave trade]]rs in [[Ancient Rome]] who kidnapped people and sold them as [[slave]]s. If a parent steals a child without the other parent's consent it is known as parental abduction. Sometimes, kidnapping is done for [[ransom]]. Many times, people kidnap children, an example is [[Amber Hagerman]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/amber-hagerman | title=How a Nine-Year-Old's Horrifying Kidnapping and Murder Inspired the AMBER Alert System | date=30 May 2021 }} < /ref >
