 '''Lanfranc''' (1005 & nbsp;{{abbr|x|sometime between}} 1010 at [[Pavia]] & nbsp;— 24 May 1089 at [[Canterbury]]) was a [[cleric]], [[teacher]] and [[jurist]] who became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] under [[William the Conqueror]]. < ref > {{lang-la|Lanfrancus}}. He is also variously known as {{nowrap|Lanfranc of Pavia}} ({{lang-it|Lanfranco di Pavia}}), {{nowrap|Lanfranc of Bec}} ({{lang-fr|Lanfranc du Bec}}), and {{nowrap|Lanfranc of Canterbury}} ({{lang-la|Lanfrancus Cantuariensis}}). < /ref > 
 
 This celebrated [[Italians|Italian]] [[jurist]] gave up his [[career]] to become a [[monk]] at [[Bec Abbey|Bec]] in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]].  In 1070 he became the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in [[England]]. This was the peak of an extraordinary life. 
 
 == Life == 
 Lanfranc was born in the early years of the 11th century at [[Pavia]] in [[Italy]]. His father, Hanbald, held a rank equivalent to a [[magistrate]].  He was [[orphan]]ed at an early age. Lanfranc was trained in the liberal arts. He crossed the [[Alps]], and took up the role of [[teacher]] in [[France]] and eventually in [[Normandy]]. About 1039 he became the master of the [[cathedral school]] at [[Avranches]]. He taught for three years with much success.  
 
 In 1042 he gave this up to become a [[monk]] in the newly founded [[Bec Abbey]]. He became the first [[prior]] of Bec Abbey in 1045. < ref name=Potter182 > Julie Potter, 'The Benefactors of Bec and the politics of priories', ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXI: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998'', ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999), p. 182 < /ref >  He became a friend of [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]] and by 1050 his [[counselor]]. < ref name=Potter182/ >  Lanfranc then became the [[abbot]] of [[Abbey of Saint-Etienne, Caen|St Stephen]] in Normandy. < ref > Frank Stenton 1989.

 In 1067, when Maurilius, Archbishop of [[Rouen]], died, Lanfranc declined the position. < ref > William Richard Wood Stephens 1901. ''The English church from the Norman conquest to the accession of Edward I (1066-1272)''. London: Macmillan, pp. 8–9 < /ref >   He would not have been able to do so without the consent of William I. It is likely William had something bigger in mind for Lanfranc. In 1070 [[Stigand]], the Archbishop of Canterbury was [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] by papal legates. William brought Lanfranc from Normandy to England to become the Archbishop of Canterbury. < ref > Louise Creighton 1882. ''A first history of England''. London: Rivingtons, p. 67 < /ref >
