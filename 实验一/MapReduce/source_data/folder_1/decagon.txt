[[File:Regular decagon.svg|thumb|A decagon]] 
 A '''decagon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 10 sides and 10 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 ==Regular decagon== 
 All sides of a '''regular decagon''' are the same length. Each corner is 144°. All corners added together equal 1440°. 
 
 ===Area=== 
 
 The amount of space a regular decagon takes up is 
 
 : < math > \text{Area} = \frac{5}{2} a^2\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}. < /math > 
 
 ''a'' is the length of one of its sides. 
 
 An alternative formula is  < math > A = 2.5dt < /math >  where ''d'' is the distance between parallel sides, or the height when the decagon stands on one side as base. < br > 	  
 By simple trigonometry  < math > d = 2t(\cos{54^\circ} + \cos{18^\circ}) < /math > . 
 
 ==Sides== 
 The side of a regular decagon inscribed in a unit circle is  < math > \tfrac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}=\tfrac{1}{\phi} < /math > , where '' & #x03D5;'' is the [[golden ratio]],  < math > \tfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} < /math > . 
 
 ==Dissection of regular decagon== 
 [[Coxeter]] states that every parallel-sided 2''m''-gon can be divided into ''m''(''m''-1)/2 rhombs. For the ''regular decagon'', ''m''=5, and it can be divided into 10 rhombs, with examples shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 10 of 80 faces in a [[Petrie polygon]] projection plane of the [[5-cube]]. A dissection is based on 10 of 30 faces of the [[rhombic triacontahedron]]. < ref > [[Coxeter]], Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 < /ref >  The list [http://oeis.org/A006245 A006245] defines the number of solutions as 62, with 2 orientations for the first symmetric form, and 10 orientations for the other 6.

 A '''skew decagon''' is a [[skew polygon]] with 10 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an decagon is not generally defined. A ''skew zig-zag decagon'' has vertices alternating between two parallel planes. 
 
 A '''[[regular skew decagon]]''' is [[vertex-transitive]] with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew decagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a [[pentagonal antiprism]], [[pentagrammic antiprism]], and [[pentagrammic crossed-antiprism]] with the same D < sub > 5d < /sub > , [2 < sup > + < /sup > ,10] symmetry, order 20. 
 
 These can also be seen in these 4 convex polyhedra with [[icosahedral symmetry]]. The polygons on the perimeter of these projections are regular skew decagons.
