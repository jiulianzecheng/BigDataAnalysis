 A '''polyhedron''' (''polyhedra'' or ''polyhedrons'' if more than one) is a [[geometry|geometrical]] [[shape]]. It is a [[3D]] shape with flat faces, and straight edges. Each face is a [[polygon]] surrounded by edges. Usually it is known by the number of faces, [[Vertex|corners]], or edges it has.  
 
 There are many groups of polyhedra, which can either be only a small set, or can be infinite. [[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]], [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], [[Antiprism|antiprisms]], and bipyramids are groups of polyhedra.  
 
 A [[regular polyhedron]] has faces that are all the same, corners that are all the same, and edges that are all the same. A uniform polyhedron can have one or two kinds of its parts be all the same.  
 
 == Definition == 
 Two types of polyhedron are [[Convex set|convex]] and concave. The edge connecting any two points of a convex polyhedron is inside the polyhedron. The line connecting two points of a concave polyhedron may go outside the polyhedron. The [[Platonic solids]] are regular convex polyhedra.  
 
 Mathematicians do not always agree on what makes a polyhedron. Some may only consider the convex polyhedra, and disregard the ones that are not convex. Some polyhedra are degenerate, meaning that when drawn as real objects, they look flat. 
 
 === Naming === 
 Usually, polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have. The first polyhedra are the [[tetrahedron]], which is made of four [[triangle]]s, [[pentahedron]] (five faces, can look like a four-sided pyramid), [[hexahedron]] (six faces, a [[cube]] if it is regular), [[heptahedron]] (seven faces) and [[octahedron]] (eight faces). [[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]], [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]] and other shapes can also be named after how many faces they have.
