 '''Spanking''' is hitting the [[buttocks]] of another person to cause them [[pain]]. Spanking usually means hitting the buttocks of another person with an open [[hand]]. Parents in some [[country|countries]] '''spank''' [[Child|children]] and [[Teenager|teenagers]] to [[punish]] them.   
 
 In some other countries this is no longer allowed. [[Parent]]s often hope that spanking will make the children obey them. From the past up to the present day, adults have spanked [[boy]]s more than they have spanked [[girl]]s. < ref name='Elder' > {{Cite journal

 When a parent spanks their child, they usually strike the child's [[buttocks]] with their open hand.  Sometimes they  use other objects such as a [[belt]] or a [[wood|wooden]] [[spoon]]. < ref >  {{cite web |url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=spank |title= Spank: The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2014 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |accessdate=1 March 2015}}  < /ref >   At times the child's buttocks may be [[Clothing|clothed]].

 The American Academy of Pediatrics is a group of [[medical doctor]]s who work with children.  They say that spanking is not a good way to help children [[learn]] how to [[behavior|behave]]. They say that it can easily [[injure]] a small child. They say that spanking can lead to [[child abuse]].  They say that parents should never spank a child with an object. < ref >  {{cite journal | author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=1 April 1998 |title= Guidance for Effective Discipline |url= http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/4/723.full |journal= Pediatrics |publisher= American Academy of Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=723–728 |doi=10.1542/peds.101.4.723 |s2cid=79545678 |accessdate=1 February 2015}}  < /ref >

 Children were always allowed more freedom in some countries, and that includes freedom from physical punishment. This goes with views as to the nature of children. In general, children from some Mediterranean countries such as Italy got more freedom than they did in northern countries.
