 '''Schlenkerla''' is a famous old [[brewery]] and [[tavern]] in [[Bamberg]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is known for its smoked beer which is called  " Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier "  ( " real Schlenkerla smoked beer " ).  It is a strong, darkish beer with a slightly smokey taste which is rather like [[bacon]].  The [[alcohol]] content is 5.1%.  There is another speciality which is called  " Urbock "  ( " Ur "  means  " original "  and  " Bock "  is actually a male [[goat]]).  The Urbock is stronger: 6.5% alcohol and is only served in the season known as the  " Starkbierzeit "  ( " Strong beer time " ) which is from [[October]] to [[6 January]].  The beer is served from [[oak]] barrels.  This is a very old tradition which is not often found nowadays.
