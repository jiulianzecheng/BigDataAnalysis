 '''Agate''' is a kind of [[quartz]] and it is a [[mineral]]. Agate can come in many different kinds and colors. Agate deposits are primarily found in large rocks such as boulders.  They take ~50 million years to form. It is characterized by colored  band patterns inside various rocks. Often, agates are also accompanied by [[Amethyst]] deposits inside. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmF-CgAAQBAJ & dq=agate+with+amethysts & pg=PT18|title=Semi-Precious Stones - A Historical Article on Agate, Amber, Amethyst and Many Other Varieties of Gemstones|last=Streeter|first=Edwin W.|date=2014-07-07|publisher=Read Books Ltd|isbn=978-1-4733-9436-0|language=en}} < /ref >
