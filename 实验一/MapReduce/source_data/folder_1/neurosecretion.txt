'''Neurosecretion''' is when [[nerve cells]] make, store and release [[hormones]]. < ref > Sharrer E.  &  B. 1945. Neurosecretion. ''Physiological Reviews'', '''25''' (1) 171{{ndash}}181. [http://physrev.physiology.org/content/25/1/171.extract] < /ref >   
 
 The [[hormonal system]] of the body is almost entirely controlled by the [[central nervous system]]. It normally does this by sending nerve impulses down [[axons]] to a [[gland]]. However, some special nerve cells can make [[hormones]] themselves, and deliver them to glands which act as storage organs. The neurons of the neuroendocrine system are large; they are mini factories for producing secretory products. These cells are called '''neurosecretory cells''', and they make '''neurohormones'''. < ref name= " AccessScience " > {{cite web|title=Neurosecretion|url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=450200 & referURL=http://www.accessscience.com/content.aspx%3fid%3d450200|work=Access Science from McGraw-Hill|access-date=5 November 2010|archive-date=17 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617073750/http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=450200 & referURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D450200|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " Biology-Online " > {{cite web|title=Neurosecretion|url=http://biology-online.org/dictionary/Neurosecretion|work=Biology-Online|access-date=5 November 2010|archive-date=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719094837/http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Neurosecretion|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > Guillemin, Roger; Schally, Andrew V.

 Most neurohormones are secreted from nerve cells in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain which (either immediately, or after storage) circulate in the blood. They are similar to normal [[endocrine]] cells and [[endocrine gland|glands]] because they regulate both endocrine and nonendocrine cells.  
 
 There are also neuroendocrine cells in the [[adrenal gland]]s, which are just above the kidneys. They are called chromaffin cells, and they release [[epinephrine]] ([[adrenaline]]) and [[norepinephrine]] ([[noradrenaline]]).
