 
 The '''deadlift''' is a [[strength training]] exercise that involves lifting a weight from the ground to a standing position. It is considered one of the most effective compound exercises for developing overall strength and muscular power. The deadlift primarily targets the muscles of the lower body, including the gluteus maximus, hamstrings, quadriceps, and spinal erectors.
