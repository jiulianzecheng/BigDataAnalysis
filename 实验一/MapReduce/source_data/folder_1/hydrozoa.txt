 The '''Hydrozoa''' are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]]. They are small predatory animals which mostly live in the sea. Their basic life form is the [[polyp]]. Some species live singly, others live in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]]. Their classification and [[evolution]]ary relationships are still under discussion. The hydroids may be best understood by taking some examples. 
 
 == Hydra == 
 The most widely-known freshwater hydrozoan is ''[[Hydra (animal)|Hydra]]'', which is found in slow-moving waters. 
 
 It is [[sessile]], with a pedal disc which attaches it to substrate. Like all cnidarians, ''Hydra'' uses [[nematocyst]]s, stinging cells which disable its prey. Hydra eat small crustaceans (such as [[brine shrimp]]), insect larvae, and [[Annelid|annelid worms]]. It may reproduce sexually, or by [[asexual reproduction]] (budding). 
 
 == Colonial types == 
 The [[Portuguese Man o' War]], ''Physalia physalis'', is a large colonial marine [[jellyfish]]. It is composed of many tiny individual [[zooid]]s, which are specialised [[polyp]]s and [[Medusa (biology)|medusae]]. The colony has an air bladder, and floats on the surface. It delivers a massive sting to its prey. Humans, if stung, may require medical attention. It is often accompanied by fish which are immune to the stings. This type of hydrozoan is called a [[siphonophore]]. 
 
 The [[chondrophores]] are another type of [[pelagic]] colonial hydrozoan. They are also carnivores, but their sting is not so harmful to humans. 
 
 == Freshwater jellyfish == 
 These have a muscular ''velum'' on the ventral surface, which allows them to move about. Beginning life as a tiny [[polyp]], attached to vegetation, they feed and reproduce sexually in the spring and summer. If the habitat has only one sex, they reproduce by budding. They overwinter as resting bodies. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 Nowadays the Hydrozoa is split into two subclasses: 
 *[[Leptolinae]]: the bulk of the [[hydroid]]s and [[siphonophera]] 
 *[[Trahylina]]: all others
