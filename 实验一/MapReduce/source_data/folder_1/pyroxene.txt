 The '''pyroxenes''' are a group of important rock-forming [[silicate mineral|inosilicate]] [[mineral]]s found in many [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[rock (geology)|rocks]]. They share a common structure consisting of single chains of silica crystals with the general formula XY(Si,Al) < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 6 < /sub >  where X and  
 Y represents metal [[ion]]s.  
 Although [[aluminium]] substitutes extensively for silicon in silicates such as [[feldspar]]s and [[amphibole]]s, the substitution occurs only to a limited extent in most pyroxenes. 
 
 '''Pyroxenite''' is an igneous rock made up of minerals from the pyroxene group.
