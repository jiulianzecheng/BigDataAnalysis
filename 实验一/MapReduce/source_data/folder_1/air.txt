 '''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air is a [[mixture]] of many gases and tiny dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and [[volume]]. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]], because it is [[matter]]. The weight of air creates [[atmosphere pressure|atmospheric pressure]]. There is no air in [[outer space]]. 
 
 Atmosphere is a [[mixture]] of about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% of [[oxygen]], and 1% other gases, such as Carbon Dioxide. 
 
 Animals live and need to breathe the oxygen in the atmosphere. In [[breathing]], the [[lung]]s put oxygen into the [[blood]], and send back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off the oxygen that we breathe. Without it we die of [[asphyxia]]. 
 
 Air can be [[air pollution|polluted]] by some gases (such as [[carbon monoxide]], hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides), [[smoke]], and ash. This [[air pollution]] causes various problems including [[smog]], [[acid rain]] and [[global warming]]. It can damage people's [[health]] and the environment. There are debates about whether or not to act upon climate change, but soon enough the Earth will heat up to much, causing our home to become too hot and not support life! Some say fewer people would die of cold weather, and that is true but there is already a huge amount of people dying from heat and that number is and will keep increasing at a frighting height. 
 
 Since early times, air has been used to create [[technology]]. Ships moved with sails and windmills used the mechanical motion of air. Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]]. [[Pneumatics]] use [[air pressure]] to move things. Since the late 1900s, air power is also used to generate electricity. 
 
 Air is invisible: it cannot be seen by the eye, though a shimmering in hot air can be seen. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.sciencefocus.com/planet-earth/why-is-air-invisible/ | title=Why is air invisible? }} < /ref > 
 
 Air is one of the 4 classical elements. 
 
 == Main history == 
 
 === ''Original atmosphere'' === 
 At first it was mainly a [[hydrogen]] atmosphere. It has changed dramatically on several occasions—for example, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] 2.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] years ago, greatly increased [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere from practically no oxygen to levels closer to present day. Humans have also contributed to significant changes in atmospheric composition through air pollution, especially since [[industrialisation]], leading to rapid environmental change such as ozone depletion and global warming. 
 
 === Second atmosphere === 
 Outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment|late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]] plus [[carbon dioxide]] and [[inert gas]]es. < ref > Zahnle K; Schaefer L;  &  Fegley B. 2010.

 === Third atmosphere ===

 The constant re-arrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide was transferred to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago. The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] is shown by the end of the [[banded iron formation]]s.
