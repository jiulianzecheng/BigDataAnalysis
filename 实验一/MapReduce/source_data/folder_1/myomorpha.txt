 [[Suborder]] '''Myomorpha''' has 1,137 species of mouse-like [[rodent]]s, almost a quarter of all [[mammal]]s. [[Mouse|mice]], [[rats]], [[gerbils]], [[hamsters]], [[lemmings]] and [[voles]] are in the group. They are grouped according to how the jaw looks like and how the [[Molar (tooth)|molar teeth]] look like. They are very good at biting and chewing. Myomorphs are found all around the world, except Antarctica, in almost all land places. They are usually animals who are more active at night and they are seed-eaters.
