 A '''triacontadigon''' or '''icosidodecagon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 32 sides and 32 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular triacontadigon == 
 All sides of a '''regular triacontadigon''' are the same length. Each corner is 168{{frac|3|4}}°. All corners added together equal 5400°. 
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular triacontadigon takes up is 
 
 : < math > \text{Area} = 8a^2 \left(1+ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{4 +2 \sqrt{2} } +\sqrt{8 +4 \sqrt{2} +2 \sqrt{20 +14 \sqrt{2} } }\right). < /math > 
 
 ''a'' is the length of one of its sides.
