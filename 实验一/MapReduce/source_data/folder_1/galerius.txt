Lactantius is commenting on Diocletian and the place where Diocletian was acclaimed, and that the  " Maximianus "  in the text is therefore a later gloss; the Paschal Chronicle is not authoritative for this period for events outside Egypt, and may simply be commenting on the day when the laureled image of the new emperors arrived in Alexandria. Potter (2004, 650) agrees that locating the acclamation to Nicomedia is false, but believes that Seston's other evidence makes a strong case for a temporal lag between the two Caesars' acclamations. < /ref > & nbsp;– & nbsp;1 May 305 (under [[Diocletian]]) < ref name =  " Barnes, New Empire, p. 4 " / >

 '''Galerius''' (Gaius Galerius Valerius Maximianus, ~250 – 5 May 311), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 305 to 311. 
 
 Galerius served as a soldier with distinction. When the [[Tetrarchy]] was introduced by [[Diocletian]] in 293 Galerius and [[Constantius Chlorus]] were given the rank of ''Caesar''. Galerius married Diocletian's daughter Valeria, and took over the [[Illyria]]n provinces. 
 
 == War with Persia == 
 === Defeat === 
 In 296, at the beginning of the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian War]], Galerius moved from the [[Danube]] to the [[Euphrates]]. There his first campaign ended in a defeat by the [[Sassanid]] prince Narses, near Callinicum. This disaster caused the loss of [[Mesopotamia]]. 
 
 Diocletian came to Antioch, where the official version of events was made clear: Galerius was to take the blame. In Antioch, Diocletian forced Galerius to walk a mile in advance of his imperial cart while still clad in the purple robes of an emperor. < ref name=Barnes > Barnes, Timothy D. 1981.

 === Victory === 
 In 298 Galerius got reinforcements from the Danube in the Spring. He led the army to attack Narseh in northern Mesopotamia, and Narseh retreated to [[Armenia]]. 
 
 The rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman [[infantry]], but unfavorable to Sassanid [[cavalry]]. Local aid gave Galerius the advantage of surprise over the Persian forces. In two battles, Galerius got victories over Narseh. < ref name=Barnes/ > < sup > p18 < /sup > < ref name=Potter/ > < sup > p293 < /sup > 
 
 During the second encounter, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his [[treasury]], his [[harem]], and his wife. < ref name=Barnes/ > < sup > p18 < /sup >  Narseh's wife would live out the remainder of the war in Daphne, a suburb of [[Antioch]].

 Narses asked for peace. Mesopotamia was returned to Roman rule and even some territory east of the [[Tigris]]. This was the greatest extension of the Roman Empire in the east. 
 
 == Last years == 
 In 305, on the [[abdication]] of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]], Galerius got the title of [[Augustus]], together with Constantius, his former colleague. Two younger men were appointed as Caesars: Maximus Daia and Severus II. 
 
 Galerius' hopes were dashed when his colleague Constantius died at [[York]] in 306. The legions raised his son [[Constantine I|Constantine]] to the position of Augustus. Galerius only discovered this when he got a letter from Constantine, who told him of his father's death, modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession, and respectfully lamented that the enthusiasm of his troops had not allowed him to get the Imperial purple in a regular manner. 
 
 The first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise, disappointment, and rage. As he could not restrain his passions, he threatened to burn both the letter and the messenger. < ref name=Barnes/ > < sup > p28/9 < /sup > < ref name=Lenski > Lenski, Noel.

 When he had time to reconsider his position, he realised his chances of winning a war against Constantine was doubtful. < ref name=Gibbon/ >  Therefore, without commenting on the choice of the British army, Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the ruler of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave him only the title of Caesar, and the fourth rank among the Roman princes, whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favourite, Severus II. 
 
 Suddenly Galerius had the unexpected loss of Italy to [[Maxentius]], his [[Son in Law|son-in-law]]. Galerius’ need for [[revenue]] led him to make a strict examination of the property of his subjects for the purpose of [[taxation]]. A survey was taken of their estates. Where there was the slightest suspicion of concealment, [[torture]] was used to get a sincere declaration of their personal wealth. 
 
 Italy had traditionally been exempt from any form of taxation, < ref name=Gibbon > Gibbon, Edward ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter 14 < /ref >  but Galerius ignored this. Italy began to murmur against this indignity and Maxentius used this sentiment to declare himself emperor in Italy, to the fury of Galerius. Therefore, Galerius ordered his colleague Severus to immediately march to Rome, so that, by his unexpected arrival, he would easily suppress the rebellion. < ref name=Gibbon/ >  Severus was quickly captured and executed by [[Maximian]], who had once again been elevated to the rank of co-emperor, this time by his son Maxentius. 
 
 The importance of the occasion needed the presence and abilities of Galerius. At the head of a powerful army collected from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]] and the East, he entered Italy. He was determined to revenge the death of Severus and to punish the rebellious Romans < ref name=Canducci > Canduci, Alexander. 2010. ''Triumph and tragedy: The rise and fall of Rome's immortal Emperors''. Pier 9. {{ISBN|1741-96598-5}} < /ref > < sup > p122 < /sup >  However, due to the skill of Maximian, Galerius found every place hostile, [[fortification|fortified]], and inaccessible. Though he forced his way as far as [[Narni]], sixty miles from Rome, he controlled only his camp. 
 
 As he was facing difficulties, Galerius made the first steps to reconciliation. He sent two officers to tempt the Romans by the offer of a conference. These offers were rejected with firmness, his friendship refused. Unless he retreated, he might meet the fate of Severus. It was not a moment too soon; money from Maxentius to his soldiers had corrupted their loyalty. When Galerius began his withdrawal from Italy, it was only with great difficulty that he managed to stop his veterans deserting him. < ref name=Gibbon/ > 
 
 In frustration, Galerius allowed his legions to ravage the countryside as they passed northwards. Maxentius declined to make a general engagement. 
 
 With so many emperors now in existence, in 308 Galerius, the retired emperor [[Diocletian]] and Maximian called an imperial 'conference' at [[Conference of Carnuntum|Carnuntum]] on the River Danube. Its aim was to bring some order back into the imperial government. < ref > Canduci, ''Triumph  &  Tragedy'', pg 120 < /ref >  Here it was agreed that Galerius’ long-time friend and military companion [[Licinius]], who had been entrusted by Galerius with the defense of the Danube while Galerius was in Italy, would become Augustus in the West, with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East, Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared a usurper. 
 
 Galerius’ plan soon failed. The news of Licinius’ promotion was carried into the East, and Maximinus, who governed the provinces of Egypt and Syria, rejected his position as Caesar. Maximus claimed (and got) the equal title of Augustus. < ref name=Gibbon/ >  For the first, and indeed for the last time, six emperors administered the Roman world. Although the memory of a recent war divided the empire into two great hostile powers, their fears and the fading authority of Galerius produced an apparent tranquility in the imperial government. 
 
 The last years of Galerius saw him keep the position of first among equals. He spent the rest of his time enjoying himself, and ordering some important public works, such as discharging into the [[Danube]] the superfluous waters of [[Lake Pelso]], and cutting down the immense forests around it. < ref name=Gibbon/ > 
 
 == Persecution of Christians ==

 Christians had lived in peace during most of the rule of Diocletian. The persecutions that began with an edict of 24 February 303, were credited by Christians to the influence of Galerius. Christian houses of assembly were destroyed, for fear of secret gatherings. 
 
 But in April 311 Galerius issued the general edict of toleration, from [[Nicomedia]] in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine. [[Lactantius]] gives the text of the edict in ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' ('On the Deaths of the Persecutors', chapters 34, 35). This marked the end of official persecution of Christians. Galerius died on 5 May, 311.
