'''Bronchiectasis''' is an [[obstructive lung disease]]. It is caused by [[inflammation]] of the [[bronchi]]. It is sometimes said to be part of the group of diseases called [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. People with bronchiectasis have swollen bronchi. 
 
 ==Signs== 
 People with bronchiectasis have pain in their chests. Some people with bronchiectasis make [[sputum]] that is green or pale yellow. The most common symptom of bronchiectasis is a cough that does not go away. 9 out of 10 people with the disease have this symptom. 3 out of 4 people with bronchiectasis often cough up a lot of sputum. This causes tiredness. People with bronchiectasis may also cough up [[blood]]. This is called [[haemoptysis]]. People with bronchiectasis may have bad breath. Some people with bronchiectasis have [[sinusitis]] that does not go away. 
 
 ==Types== 
 There are three kinds of bronchiectasis. These are: 
 *Cylindrical bronchiectasis 
 *Varicose bronchiectasis 
 *Saccular or cystic - This is the most severe type. It is often found in people with [[cystic fibrosis]]. 
 
 ==Causes== 
 People can be born with bronchiectasis or they can develop it later. In about 4 out of 10 cases, a cause is found. People who have [[rheumatoid arthiritis]] and smoke are ten times more likely to have the disease. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Association between bronchiectasis and smoking in patients with rheumatoid arthritis|first1=V|last1=Kaushik|first2=D|last2=Hutchinson|first3=J|last3=Desmond|first4=M|last4=Lynch|first5=J|last5=Dawson|date=1 August 2004|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|volume=63|issue=8|pages=1001–1002|doi=10.1136/ard.2003.015123|pmid=15249329|pmc=1755104}} < /ref >  Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency have also been found to be more likely to get bronchiectasis but it is not known why. < ref > Shin MS, Ho KJ (1993).

 ==Diagnosis== 
 It is usually diagnosed using a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]]. 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 [[Antibiotics]] are used to treat bronchiectasis. It can also be treated with other drugs. Sometimes surgery is needed. 
 
 == Prevention == 
 To prevent bronchiectasis, it is essential to avoid lung infections and lung damage that can cause it. Children should get vaccines to protect against measles, whooping cough, and pneumonia. Parents should watch their children to prevent them from breathing in small objects like food or toys. People with bronchiectasis should avoid smoking and breathing in harmful fumes or gases that can cause infections and more problems. 
 
 To slow down the progress of this long-term disease, doctors recommend keeping the airways clear and removing mucus from the lungs. Antibiotics can be used to treat infections and stop the cycle of damage and more infections. Regular vaccines for pneumonia, the flu, and whooping cough can also help. Maintaining a healthy body weight and seeing a doctor regularly can also be helpful. The severity of symptoms and the extent of damage seen on X-rays can affect how likely a person is to survive this disease. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[René Laennec]] wrote the first description of bronchiectasis in 1819. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Rene Theophile Hyacinthe Laënnec (1781–1826): The Man Behind the Stethoscope|first=Ariel|last=Roguin|date=1 September 2006|journal=Clinical Medicine and Research|volume=4|issue=3|pages=230–235|doi=10.3121/cmr.4.3.230|pmid=17048358|pmc=1570491}} < /ref >
