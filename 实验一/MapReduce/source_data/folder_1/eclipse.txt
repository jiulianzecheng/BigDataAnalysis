 An '''eclipse''' is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] event.  It is when one object in the [[sky]] moves into the [[shadow]] of another such object.  When an eclipse happens within a system of stars, like the [[Solar System]], it makes a type of syzygy. This means that three or more objects in the sky are lined up in a straight line in the same [[gravity|gravitational]] system. < ref > {{cite press release

 The term ''eclipse'' is most often used to describe a ''[[solar eclipse]]'', when the [[Moon]]'s shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a ''[[lunar eclipse]]'', when the [[Moon]] moves into the shadow of [[Earth]]. No solar eclipse can last longer than 7 minutes and 58 seconds because of the speed at which the Earth and Moon move.  
 
 When the Sun is not involved, the event is called [[occultation]].  
 
 == Etymology == 
 The word comes from the [[ancient Greek]] [[noun]] {{lang|grc|ἔκλειψις}} (''{{transl|grc|ékleipsis}}''), which is from the verb {{lang|grc|ἐκλείπω}} (''{{transl|grc|ekleípō}}''). This means  " to cease (stop) to exist (be there) " . < ref >  http://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++ & x=0 & y=0  < /ref > < ref >  http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation & do=dictionary & language_id_from=23 & language_id_to=8 & word=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+ & t.x=55 & t.y=16  < /ref >
