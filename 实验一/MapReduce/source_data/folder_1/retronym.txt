A '''retronym''' is a new name for something that already exists. This is so that people can tell the older thing apart from the newer one. 
 
 For example, the name  " [[acoustic guitar]] "  was made to tell them apart from [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]]. Before electric guitars, acoustic guitars were just called [[Guitar|guitars]] because there were no other kinds of guitars. Therefore, the name  " acoustic guitar "  is a retronym for the word guitar.
