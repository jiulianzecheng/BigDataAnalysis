 '''Isoprene''' is a common [[organic compound]] produced by living things. Its full chemical name is '''2-methyl-1,3-butadiene''', and its formula is CH < sub > 2 < /sub > =C(CH < sub > 3 < /sub > )−CH=CH < sub > 2 < /sub > . Isoprene is an [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated hydrocarbon]]. It is produced by many plants and animals (including humans). Its [[polymers]] are the main component of [[natural rubber]]. < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0160-9327(96)10014-4 |title=Isoprene synthesis by plants and animals |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_endeavour_1996-06_20_2/page/74 |journal=Endeavour |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=74–78 |year=1996 |last1=Sharkey |first1=Thomas D. |pmid=8690002 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=C.

 Isoprene is produced and emitted by many species of trees (major producers are [[oak]]s, [[poplars]], [[eucalyptus]], and some [[legumes]]). Yearly production of isoprene emissions by vegetation is around 600 million [[metric ton]]s, half from tropical broadleaf trees (that is, [[flowering plant]]s) and the rest mainly from [[shrub]]s. < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.5194/acp-6-3181-2006 |title=Estimates of global terrestrial isoprene emissions using MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) |journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=3181–3210 |year=2006 |last1=Guenther |first1=A. |last2=Karl |first2=T. |last3=Harley |first3=P. |last4=Wiedinmyer |first4=C. |last5=Palmer |first5=P.

 This is about the same as [[methane]] emissions. It accounts for about one-third of all [[hydrocarbons]] released into the atmosphere. In [[deciduous forest]]s, isoprene makes up about 80% of hydrocarbon emissions.  Microscopic and macroscopic [[algae]] also produce isoprene, but much less than trees. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Johnston|first1=Antonia|last2=Crombie|first2=Andrew T.|last3=El Khawand|first3=Myriam|last4=Sims|first4=Leanne|last5=Whited|first5=Gregg M.|last6=McGenity|first6=Terry J.|last7=Colin Murrell|first7=J.|date=September 2017|title=Identification and characterisation of isoprene-degrading bacteria in an estuarine environment: Estuarine isoprene-degrading bacteria|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=19|issue=9|pages=3526–3537|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.13842|pmc=6849523|pmid=28654185}} < /ref >

It may also protect plants against large fluctuations in leaf temperature. Isoprene is built into [[cell membrane]]s and helps  membranes keep stable. 
 
 Isoprene produces the blue haze which gives the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] their name.
