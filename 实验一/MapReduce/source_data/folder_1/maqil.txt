The '''Maqil''' ({{lang-ar|المعقل}}) were an [[Arabian]] [[nomadic people|nomadic]] [[tribe]].  In the [[11th century]] they [[migrate]]d from [[Yemen]] into what is now the [[Sahara Desert]] and [[Morocco]]. < ref name=Appiah360 > ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'', eds. Anthony Appiah; Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Second Edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 360 < /ref >  They mainly settled near [[forest]]s and [[oasis|oases]]. 
 
 Despite their originally small number (less than 200), they were later involved in fighting a [[dynasty]] of [[Sunni Muslim]]s. They also brought change to the [[culture]] of these regions, and a new [[language]].

 == History == 
 The exact origin of the Maqil tribe is unknown. < ref name= " pp78 " > {{cite book |title= تاريخ ابن خلدون: ديوان المبتدأ و الخبر في تاريخ العرب و البربر و من عاصرهم من ذوي الشأن الأكبر |last= Ibn Khaldun |first=Abderahman |author-link=Ibn Khaldun |year=1377 |publisher= دار الفكر | volume=6 |page=78 }} < /ref >  They claimed for themselves a prestigious Banu Hashim descent from Jaafar ibn Abi Talib, son of [[Abu Talib]] and brother of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. Arabian genealogists categorized them as [[Banu Hilal|Hilalians]]. < ref name=pp78/ >  [[Ibn Khaldun]] wrote that both of these versions are false, since the Banu Hashim lived in urban cities and were not nomadic nor ever wandered in desert wolds. < ref name=pp78/ >  He added that the Maqil is a name only found in [[Yemen]]. < ref name=pp78/ > 
   
 [[Ibn Khaldun]] speculated that they were likely an [[Arab]] nomadic group from [[Yemen]], and this is supported by bn al-Kalbi and Ibn Said. < ref name=pp78/ > < ref name=pp79 > {{cite book |title= تاريخ ابن خلدون: ديوان المبتدأ و الخبر في تاريخ العرب و البربر و من عاصرهم من ذوي الشأن الأكبر |last= Ibn Khaldun |first=Abderahman |author-link=Ibn Khaldun |year=1377 |publisher= دار الفكر | volume=6 |page=79 }} < /ref >
