'''Phonemes''' are the units of sound ([[speech]]) which distinguish one [[word]] from another in a particular language. < ref > ''Concise Oxford English dictionary'', p1027. < /ref >  In most [[Lect|varieties]] ([[Accent|accents]] and [[Dialects of English|dialects]]) of spoken English there are about 23 [[consonant]]al phonemes and 21 [[vowel]] phonemes (altogether 44 phonemes), but only 26 [[letter]]s in writing. To see all the phonemes in English, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], has a unique letter for every phoneme, unlike the [[English alphabet]].  
 
 A good way to learn phonemes in a language is to learn [[Minimal pair|minimal pairs]]. A minimal pair is a pair of different words that are different by only one sound. An example of this is  " b'''i'''t "  and  " b'''a'''t " . Even though only the vowel in each word is different, each word has a completely different meaning. Another example is  " '''d'''ip "  and  " '''t'''ip " , where both words have different meanings even though only the first consonant in each word is different.
