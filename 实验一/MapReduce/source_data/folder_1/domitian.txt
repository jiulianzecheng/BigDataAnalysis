 '''Domitian''' (Titus Flavius Domitianus, 24 October 51 – 18 September 96) was a [[Roman emperor]] who reigned from 14 September 81 until his death in AD 96. 
 
 == Biography == 
 Domitian was the last emperor of the [[Flavian dynasty]], which ruled the [[Roman Empire]] between 69 and 96, This included the reigns of Domitian's father [[Vespasian]] (69–79), his elder brother [[Titus]] (79–81), and that of Domitian himself. 
 
 When Titus died (he was struck down by a fatal illness in 81), the next day Domitian was declared emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]]. This started a reign which lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who ruled since [[Tiberius]]. < ref > Although several emperor reigns came within a year or two of 15-year reigns. < /ref > 
 
 As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]]. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of [[Rome]]. 
 
 Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola |Agricola]] attempted to conquer [[Scotland]], and in [[Dacia]], where Domitian was unable to win a [[decisive victory]] against king [[Decebalus]]. 
 
 Domitian's rule was [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. He saw himself as the new [[Augustus]], as an enlightened [[wikt:despot|despot]] destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural [[propaganda]] fostered a [[cult of personality]]. By nominating himself perpetual [[Roman censor|censor]], he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the [[Roman Senate]]. 
 
 Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day, he was succeeded by his advisor [[Nerva]]. After his death, Domitian's memory was [[damnatio memoriae|condemned to oblivion]] by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Younger]] and [[Suetonius]] published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and [[paranoia|paranoid]] [[tyrant]]. 
 
 Modern history has rejected these views. Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century. < ref > Jones, Brian W. (1984).
