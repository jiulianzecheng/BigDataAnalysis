 The '''Macaronesian islands''', or simply '''Macaronesia''' is a modern name for several groups of islands of [[volcano|volcanic origin]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. They belong to three countries: [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[Cape Verde]]. 
 
 ==Origin of name== 
 '''Macaronesia''' ({{lang-el|makáron}} 'blessed', 'happy' and {{lang|el|nêsoi}} 'island'; '[[Blessing|blessed]]/[[Luck|fortunate]] islands'). This term was used by [[Ancient Greek]] [[geographer]]s for islands to the west of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. 
 
 The modern use of the term Macaronesia goes to the botanist Philip Barker Webb in the 1830s for [[Botany|botanical]] descriptions. < ref > {{cite book |last=Kunkel |first=Günther |authorlink= |year=1993 |title=Die Kanarischen Inseln und ihre Pflanzenwelt |publisher=Gustav Fischer Verlag |location=Stuttgart, Jena, New York |language=German |isbn=3-437-20491-2 }} < /ref >  The name is occasionally misspelled  " Macronesia "  in analogy with [[Micronesia]]. 
 
 ==Islands included== 
 The following groups of islands ([[archipelago]]s) are commonly counted as being part of the Macaronesia - from north to south: 
 #Portuguese islands 
 #*[[Azores]] ({{PRT}}): area {{convert|2333|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, population 245,746 (2012) 
 #*[[Madeira Islands]] ({{PRT}}): area {{convert|801|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, population 267,785 (2011) 
 #Spanish islands 
 #*[[Canary Islands]] ({{SPA}}): area {{convert|7493|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, population 2,117,519 (2011) 
 #Independent 
 #*[[Cape Verde]] ({{CPV}}): area {{convert|4033|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, population 523,568 (2013 est.) 
 
 [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is spoken in the Canary Islands and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in the rest of the islands. Cape Verde was a [[colony]] of Portugal but it is independent since 1975. 
 
 ==Geography and environment== 
 [[Image:Laurisilva Madeira.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Laurel forest''' (''Laurisilva'') in the Madeira island.]] 
 The islands of Macaronesia are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, and are thought to be the product of several geologic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]s. 
 
 The [[climate]] of the Macaronesian islands goes from [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the Azores and Madeira to [[arid]] in Cape Verde. The Portuguese archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a generally cooler climate and higher rainfall than the Canary Islands and Cape Verde. 
 
 Even if the distances between the different groups of islands are large, the plants and animals are similar and there are many [[Endemism|endemic]] plants that are found only in these islands. 
 
 The islands have a unique [[biogeography]], and are home to several distinct plant and animal communities. The laurel forests,{{efn| 1 = A '''laurel forest''' or '''''laurisilva''''' means that the trees have leaves as the [[Bay laurel|laurel]] but it does not mean that there are laurel trees or any other tree of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Lauraceae]], even if they are common in this type of forest.}} known as ''[[laurisilva]]'', of Macaronesia are a type of mountain cloud forest{{efn| 1 = A '''cloud forest''' is a tropical or subtropical, [[evergreen]], moist forest in mountains characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level [[cloud]] cover. Cloud forests often have an abundance of [[moss]]es covering the ground and vegetation. }} with species of a [[vegetation]] type which originally covered much of the [[Mediterranean]] [[Basin (geology)|Basin]] when the [[climate]] of the region was more [[humidity|humid]] and evolved to adapt to island conditions. These forests once covered most of the Azores, Madeira, and parts of the Canary Islands ( " Canaries " ) between 400–1200 m altitude (the eastern Canaries and Cape Verde being too dry). 
 
 ==Conservation issues== 
 Cutting the trees for [[timber]] and [[wood]], clearing vegetation for [[grazing]] and [[agriculture]], and the introduction of plants and animals by humans has displaced much of the native vegetation. The laurisilva has been reduced to small pockets.  As a result, many of the endemic [[biota]] of the islands are seriously endangered or extinct.
