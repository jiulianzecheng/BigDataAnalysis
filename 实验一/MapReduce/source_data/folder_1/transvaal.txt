 The '''Transvaal''' (lit. ''beyond the [[Vaal]] [pale river]'') is the name of an area of northern [[South Africa]]. At the start, it made up a great part of the independent [[Boer]] [[South African Republic]]. Before the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]] of 1899-1902 it became the Transvaal Colony. It is one of the original [[Provinces of South Africa|provinces]] of the [[Union of South Africa]] from [[1910]] until [[1994]] with capital in [[Pretoria]]. The province no longer exists, and its territory now forms the provinces of [[Gauteng]], [[Limpopo Province|Limpopo]] and [[Mpumalanga Province|Mpumalanga]] and part of the [[North West Province]]. Even though it no longer exists as an administrative unit, the Transvaal is still a commonly used geographical term and retains its historical meaning.
