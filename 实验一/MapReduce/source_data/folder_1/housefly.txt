 '''Housefly''' is the common [[fly]] often found in houses. The Latin name for the housefly is ''[[Musca (fly)|Musca]] domestica''. This [[species]] is always found near humans. It is the most common species found on hog and poultry farms, horse stables and ranches. Not only are house flies a nuisance, but they also carry disease-causing organisms. Flies are not only an irritant to farm workers but may be a [[public health]] concern. Houseflies are [[pest (biology)|pests]] and can carry [[disease]]s. 
 
 Each female fly can lay about 9,000 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in its life, in several batches of about 75 to 150. < ref name= " bennett " > {{cite web |author=Stuart M. Bennett |year=2003 |title=Housefly |url=http://www.the-piedpiper.co.uk/th6a.htm}} < /ref >  The eggs are laid on or near meat, often dead animals. Within a day, larvae ([[maggot]]s) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed on dead and decaying organic material, such as garbage, carrion or [[faeces]]. They are pale-whitish, and have no legs. Their life cycle is from 14 hours to 36 hours.  
 
 At the end of their third [[instar]], the maggots crawl to a dry, cool place and turn into [[pupa]]e. These are coloured reddish-brown and about 8 & nbsp;mm long. From the pupae emerge adult flies. The whole cycle is known as [[metamorphosis|complete metamorphosis]].  
 
 Adults live from two weeks to a month in the wild. After they come out from the pupae, the flies do not grow. Small flies of the same species did not get enough food when they were larvae. < ref name= " ct " > {{cite news |author=Anthony DeBartolo |url=http://www.hydeparkmedia.com/housefly.html |title=Buzz off!
