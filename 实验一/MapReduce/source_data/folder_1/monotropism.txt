'''Monotropism''' is a way that the autistic brain works, and can be thought to be a big part of what defines [[autism]]. A monotropic mind is one that focuses very strongly on only a few things. [[Dinah Murray]] and [[Wenn lawson|Wenn Lawson]]  made the theory of monotropism, which was written about in [[Autism (journal)|the journal ''Autism'']] with [[Mike Lesser|Mike Lesser]] in 2005. 
 
 Monotropic minds can focus on things very strongly, but this means that it's likely for a monotropic mind to have 'tunnel vision', which is when things that are not being focused on are not noticed at all. This stronger thinking can be a very positive feeling. However, monotropism means that moving from one task to another is harder. Starting and stopping activities is also hard, because a monotropic mind keeps getting pulled to focus on a small number of things.
