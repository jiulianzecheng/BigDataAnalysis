'''Protonation''' is the addition of a [[hydrogen]] [[ion]] to a substance. A hydrogen atom normally contains 1 [[proton]] and 1 [[electron]]. When the hydrogen atom is [[oxidation|oxidized]], it loses its electron, leaving a H < sup > + < /sup > . The H < sup > + < /sup >  is the same as a proton. Substances are protonated when hydrogen ions are added to them. For example, when [[ammonia]] (NH < sub > 3 < /sub > ) is protonated, it forms [[ammonium]] ions, NH < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > + < /sup > . A substance is protonated by a substance more [[acid|acidic]] than it. The acidic substance is [[deprotonation|deprotonated]].
