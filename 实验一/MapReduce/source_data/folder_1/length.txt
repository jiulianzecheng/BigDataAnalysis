 '''Length''' is a [[measurement]]. The length of something is the [[distance]] between two ends of the thing. '''Short''' means a small length. '''Long''' means much length. '''Short''' and '''long''' are [[opposite]]s. For [[two dimensional]] things, length is usually the longer side. 
 
 A ruler is a tool used to measure length. 
 
 == Measuring == 
 All the sides on [[shapes]] have a length. The length is between the two points of the side. You can also find the length of any two points on a shape, even if they are not on one side. 
 
 A shape can have different lengths based on how many [[dimension]]s it takes. 
 * A line has one [[size]] measurement. This measurement is the length.  
 * A rectangle has two measurements that show its size. These two measurements are the length and the [[width]] of the rectangle.  
 * The length and width of a [[square]] are the same.  
 * A [[box]] has three measurements that show its size. These three measurements are the length, the width and the [[height]] of the box. 
 * A circle has [[diameter]], the length across the circle. A circle also has [[circumference]], the length around its side. 
 
 == Examples == 
 * The distance from the front of the [[bus]] to the back of the bus is 30 meters. The bus is 30 meters in length.  
 * A piece of wood is 10 [[meters]] X 10 [[cm]] X 15 cm. The piece of wood is 10 meters in length, 10 cm in breadth and 15 cm in height. 
 
 == Length of time == 
 Length can also mean an amount of [[time]]. The length is measured by looking at the time at the start, then looking at the time at the end. 
 
 You might sit down at [[24-hour clock|one o'clock]]. If you stand up at three o'clock, you would be sitting for two hours. The length of time is two hours.
