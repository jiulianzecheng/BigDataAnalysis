In [[politics]], a '''congress''' is a political meeting of leaders or representatives of groups of people. Until the 19th century it was usually a meeting of kings or their representatives, for example the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Today it often means the main [[legislature]] that makes the [[law]]s for a [[state]]. The word congress can also mean a meeting of associations, as in the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC), of the [[United Kingdom]], a meeting of [[trade union]]s.
