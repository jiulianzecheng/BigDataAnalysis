 '''Makalani''' is the name given to a certain [[palm tree]], growing in northern [[Namibia]] ([[South Africa|Southern Africa]]). The local Owambo people call a full grown palm tree  " Omulunga "  and a sapling  " Oshivale. "  These palm trees grow very high and it takes many years for a Makalani sapling to grow into a full-grown tree. 
 
 The seeds look like small [[coconut]]s, and the local [[wikt:people|people]], the Owambos and Himbas, peel the outer [[ginger]] looking skin and carve the inner hard core to certain objects of art. The inner core is white with a dark brown skin, the size of a golf ball, and it is hollow inside. The Makalani fruit (Ondunga/Onduga)is very useful to the local people. It can be eaten and can also be used to brew Ombike/Owalende: the Oshiwambo brew that looks and taste similar to Whiskey.   
 There are now also some [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[wikt:guest|guesthouses]] which have adopted the name Makalani (in Namibia). These include Makalani Sugar processors, Makalani Holdings and Makalani Airtime Distributors.
