 '''Bruxism''' is the problem of too much [[tooth]] grinding or [[jaw]] clenching. < ref name= " Wassell 2008 " / >  It is not a normal use for teeth like eating or talking. < ref name= " Wassell 2008 "  / >  Bruxism is a common problem that affects 8–31% of people. < ref name= " Manfredini 2013 "  / >  Bruxism can wear down teeth, make them too sensitive, and cause [[headache]]s and [[jaw pain]]. It can also harm dental work like crowns and fillings. < ref name= " Tyldesley 2003 "  / >  Sometimes these problems are not noticed, so not everyone with bruxism knows they have it. 
 
 There are two main kinds of bruxism: sleep bruxism and awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism happens when the person sleeps, and awake bruxism happens when the person is awake. [[Symptoms]] of sleep bruxism are often worse when waking up. Awake bruxism can feel fine when waking up, then get worse as the day goes on. There may be many reasons why people grind their teeth and clench their jaws. < ref name= " Cawson 2002 "  / > < ref name= " Shetty 2010 "  / >  Awake bruxism may have different causes from sleep bruxism. Females are more likely to have awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism affects males as often as females. < ref name= " Shetty 2010 "  / >  Several [[treatment]]s are used, but none are proved to be very effective. < ref name= " LOBBEZOO 2008 "  / >
