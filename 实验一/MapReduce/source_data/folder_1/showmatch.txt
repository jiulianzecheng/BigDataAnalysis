 ==Reviews== 
 Showmatch has aired for years as one of the most successful programs in the history of Argentine television. It is due to its great impact on the industry and its high audience numbers, generally managing to beat all its competition. < ref > [http://www.impulsonegocios.com/contenidos/2010/05/07/Editorial_6628.php Showmatch marcó el rating más alto de la TV argentina], Impulso Negocios. < /ref > < ref > [http://www.impulsonegocios.com/contenidos/2011/05/27/Editorial_13413.php El rating de la TV argentina sigue dominado por ShowMatch: Bailando 2011], Impulso Negocios. < /ref >  These factors have managed to keep the program over time, considering it a true phenomenon. However, since 2015, the average rating of the program has dropped, getting low ratings never seen before. 2021 became the worst year for the program. 
 
 ==History==  
 ===Early history=== 
 It began broadcasting on April 4, 2005 on Channel 9. It was produced until 2017 by Ideas del Sur. It is the continuity of Videomatch, also from the same production company. From 2006 until its end, on December 10, 2021;  and except for the year 2013 and 2020 that did not air; was broadcast on [[El Trece]]. From 2018 to 2021, the production is in charge of LaFlia Contents. 
 ===2017 - 2021=== 
 
 After the rupture at the end of 2017 with Grupo Indalo (temporarily renamed Grupo Ceibo) after a year with many conflicts that almost caused the end of the program's broadcasts, the continuity of Showmatch was confirmed for 2018 and 2019 with the support of [[El Trece]].  
 
 However, as it turned out, the program had to change its name, since the Showmatch brand would not belong to the new production, so the possibility of taking the Videomatch name again was considered. However, given the protection of said name because it is owned by [[Telefe]], the name used for the 2018 season is simply  " Bailando 2018 " . In mid-June, it was confirmed that the program would return to its title Showmatch as before until its final season, in 2021.
