 '''Carotenoids''' (or '''tetraterpenoids''') are [[organic compound|organic]] [[pigment]]s. They are found in the [[chloroplasts]] and [[chromoplast]]s of [[plants]], and also some [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]].  
 
 The only animals known to [[produce]] carotenoids are [[aphids]] and [[mites]], which [[horizontal gene transfer|got the genes]] from [[fungi]]. < ref > {{Cite journal |author=Altincicek, Boran; Jennifer L.

 There are over 600 known carotenoids. They are of two types, [[xanthophyll]]s (which contain oxygen) and [[carotene]]s (which are purely [[hydrocarbons]] with no [[oxygen]]).  
 
 Carotenoids have two key roles in plants and [[algae]]: they absorb light energy for use in [[photosynthesis]], and they protect [[chlorophyll]] from photodamage. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Armstrong G.A.  &  Hearst J.E. |title=Carotenoids 2: Genetics and molecular biology of carotenoid pigment biosynthesis |journal=FASEB J. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=228–37 |year=1996 |pmid=8641556 |doi= 10.1096/fasebj.10.2.8641556|s2cid=22385652 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long & pmid=8641556}} < /ref >  Beta-carotene is the most common form in plants.  
 
 Some carotenoids (like [[β-carotene]]) have [[vitamin A]] activity (so they can convert to [[retinol]]). These and other carotenoids can also act as [[antioxidant]]s. In the eye, certain other carotenoids ([[lutein]], [[astaxanthin]], < ref > {{cite journal|last=Kidd|first=Parris|title=Astaxanthin: cell membrane nutrient with diverse clinical benefits and anti-aging potential|journal=Alternative Medicine Review|date=2011|volume=16|issue=4|pages=335–364|pmid=22214255|url=http://www.altmedrev.com/publications/16/4/355.pdf|access-date=2016-01-13|archive-date=2016-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731233338/http://www.altmedrev.com/publications/16/4/355.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and [[zeaxanthin]]) apparently act directly to absorb damaging blue and near-[[ultraviolet]] light. This protects the [[macula lutea|macula]] of the [[retina]], the part of the eye with the [[visual acuity|sharpest vision]].
