 {{nihongo|'''Kamaboko'''|蒲鉾}}, also known as '''surimi'''' is a cured, processed [[seafood]] product of [[Japan]]. It is made of puréed white fish, formed into different shapes including semi-cylinder loafs, and steamed until it becomes firm. Some ''kamaboko'' known as ''narutomaki'' is made with a swirl pattern in the center of each slice, named after the famous tidal [[whirlpool]] in the Japanese city [[Naruto, Tokushima|Naruto]]. Outside of Japan, ''kamaboko'' is often referred to as fish cake. 
 
 ''Kamaboko'' has been made in Japan since the 14th century CE and has become commonly available in many other countries. One example that can be found in the West is ''kanikama'' (also known as ''kani kamaboko''), or imitation crab. This variation of ''surimi'' is quite common in the West as it is a cheap substitute for real crab meat. 
 
 In Japan, ''kamaboko'' can often be seen served as a topping over [[ramen]] or [[udon]]. It is also commonly sold at convenience stores as ''chikama'' (''kamaboko'' and cheese).
