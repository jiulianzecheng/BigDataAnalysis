 A '''hairstyle''' is the way hair is cut and [[style]]d. A '''haircut''' may be just practical, but a '''hairdo''' suggests professional styling. The fashioning of hair is an aspect of [[fashion]], and [[cosmetics]], especially for females. Practical, cultural, and popular considerations also influence hairstyles. 
 
 People in many cultures cut their [[hair]], rather than letting it grow naturally. < ref > {{cite web|title=Blowout haircut for Kids and Mens|url=http://machohairstyles.com/best-blowout-haircut/|publisher=MachoHairStyles|accessdate=30 March 2016}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Modern Hairstyles  &  Modern Trends|url=http://hairstylezz.com/best-partial-highlights/|publisher=HairStylezz|accessdate=1 May 2015|archive-date=21 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521225555/http://hairstylezz.com/best-partial-highlights/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Hair styles < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-12-05|title=8 Attractive Hairstyles For Hair Extensions This 2023 - Jen Hair|url=https://jenhair.com/blog/hairstyles-for-hair-extensions.html|access-date=2023-03-25|language=en-US}} < /ref >  are often used to signal [[cultural]], [[social]], and [[ethnic]] identity and can be used to show [[social status]] or get attention. < ref > {{cite web|title=Fade Buzz Cut from hitler youth haircut|url=http://stylemann.com/best-hitler-youth-haircut/#21_Fade_Buzz_Cut|publisher=StyleMann|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=4 April 2016}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Future Army Man from baby boy haircuts|url=http://stylemann.com/best-baby-boy-haircuts/#12_Future_Army_Man|publisher=StyleMann|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=4 April 2016}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Mohawk haircut|url=http://machohairstyles.com/best-mohawk-haircut/|publisher=MachoHairStyles|accessdate=30 March 2016}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Thick French-Mohawk haircuts from braids for long hair|url=http://stylemann.com/best-braids-for-long-hair/#21_Thick_French-Mohawk|publisher=StyleMann|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=4 April 2016}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Skin Fade and Textured Top haircut|url=http://stylemann.com/best-caesar-haircut/#3_Skin_Fade_and_Textured_Top|publisher=StyleMann|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=4 April 2016}} < /ref >
