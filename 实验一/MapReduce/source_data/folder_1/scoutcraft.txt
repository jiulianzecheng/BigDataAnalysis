'''Scoutcraft''' is a form of [[woodcraft]] skills used in the woods and the  " backcountry. "   Though it has been practiced for hundreds of years, it was first called  " scoutcraft "  by [[Robert Baden-Powell]] and [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], who wrote books about it about a hundred years ago. < ref name= " scoutingforboys " > {{cite book | last =Baden-Powell | first =Robert | author-link =Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | title =Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship | publisher =H.

For example, in England, scoutcraft once included [[citizenship]], while in America, it once included [[indian lore]] and [[signaling]].  At present, scoutcraft includes [[camping]], [[hiking]] (walking through the woods or backcountry), [[backpacking]] (a combination of camping and hiking), [[orienteering]] (use of a map and compass to find ones way through the backcountry), [[pioneering]] (building structures out of logs using knots), [[first aid]], and [[survival skills|wilderness survival]].
