 '''''Bagpuss''''' is a popular  [[children]]'s [[television programme|television series]] shown on [[BBC]] [[television]].  It was shown in 1974. Although only 13 [[episode]]s were made, it was so popular that it was repeated regularly until 1987.  The series was made by [[Peter Firmin]] and [[Oliver Postgate]] through their [[company]] [[Smallfilms]]. 
 
 The [[Fictional character|character]] Bagpuss was a [[toy]] [[cat]].  Bagpuss was described in each [[television programme|programme]] as  " an old, saggy [[cloth]] cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams " . 
 
 Each programme began in the same way.  It started by looking through old [[sepia tone|sepia]] [[photograph]]s as these words were spoken: 
 
 :'' " Once upon a time,'' 
 :''not'' ''so long ago,'' 
 :''there was a little girl and her name was Emily.'' 
 :''And she had a shop. " '' 
 
 There was a [[shop]] called “Bagpuss  &  Co”.   The cat sat in the shop [[window]].  The owner of the shop was a little girl named Emily.  The shop did not sell anything.  Instead, Emily would find things that were broken and lost.  She fixed them and put them in the shop window. Emily hoping that the owners of the things would come and get them.  She would leave the fixed thing in front of her favourite toy: the stuffed cat Bagpuss.  Each programme began with these words: 
 
 :'' " Bagpuss, oh, Bagpuss'' 
 :''Oh, fat, furry cat puss,'' 
 :''Wake up and look at the thing that I bring'' 
 :''Wake up, be bright, be golden and light. 
 :''Bagpuss, oh hear what I sing. " '' 
 
 When Emily had left, Bagpuss would wake up. The programme changed from sepia to [[colour]] [[photographic film|film]], and the toys in the shop would come to life.  There was Gabriel the [[toad]], a [[rag doll]] called Madeleine, and a [[wood]]en [[woodpecker]] which was a bookend (something to stop a row of [[book]]s falling over) called Professor Yaffle.  Professor Yaffle spoke like a clever [[professor]].  He had a [[German language|German]] [[accent]] and wore a [[pince-nez]].  He would look at the object and tell the [[audience]] what it was used for.  There were also some [[mouse|mice]].  They lived in the “mouse organ” (a [[pun]] on the word [[mouthorgan]]).  The mouse organ played [[music]] and the mice squeaked in high [[voice]]s.  All the voices except those of Madeleine and Gabriel were done by  [[Oliver Postgate]] who also wrote the [[Story|stories]]. 
 
 At the end of the programme, Bagpuss would yawn again and fall asleep. The colour changed back to sepia and the toys became toys again as these words were spoken: 
 
 :'' " Bagpuss gave a big yawn, and settled down to sleep.'' 
 :''And of course when Bagpuss goes to sleep'' 
 :''All his friends go to sleep too.'' 
 :''The mice were ornaments on the mouse organ,'' 
 :''Gabriel and Madeleine were just dolls.'' 
 :''And Professor Yaffle was a carved, wooden bookend in the shape of a woodpecker.'' 
 :''Even Bagpuss himself, once he was asleep, was just an old, saggy cloth cat.'' 
 :''Baggy, and a bit loose at the seams, but Emily loved him. " ''
