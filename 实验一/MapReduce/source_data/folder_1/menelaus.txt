'''Menelaus''' ({{lang-el|Μενέλαος}}, ''Menelaos'' -  " wrath of the people " ) is one of the central figures in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and a hero of the [[Trojan War]]. He was the son of King [[Atreus]] and Queen [[Aerope]] of [[Mycenae]], and the brother of [[Agamemnon]]. He was the king of [[Sparta]]. His wife was [[Helen of Troy]], said to be the most beautiful woman in the world. She was kidnapped by Prince [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Troy]]. That caused the [[Trojan War]], as Menelaus sought to get Helen back. Prior to the war, Menelaus had one child with Helen, a daughter named [[Hermione (mythology)|Hermione]].
