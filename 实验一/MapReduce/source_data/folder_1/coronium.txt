 '''Coronium''' was thought to be a [[chemical element]]  in 1882. The evidence was a thin green [[spectroscopy|spectrometry]] line in the [[solar corona]]. In 1930, it was proved that it did not exist. The green line was just highly [[Ionization|ionized]] [[iron]], (Fe < sup > 13+ < /sup > ), which is now called coronium.
