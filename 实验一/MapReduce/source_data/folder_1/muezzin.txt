 A '''muezzin''' is a man who calls [[Muslim]] people to [[Salat|prayer]] through the [[adhan]] from the [[minaret]] of a [[mosque]].  
 
 He leads the call (''[[adhan]]'') to Friday service and the five daily prayers (also known as the [[salat]]) from one of the mosque's [[minaret]]s. Blind people often got the position; this is so that they could not see the places where women gathered. Today, many mosques have electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]], and the muezzin no longer needs to be on the minaret.  
 
 In the city of [[Abu Dhabi]], the call to prayer is coordinated, all mosques transmit the call of the muezzin of [[Sheikh Zayed Mosque]]. The idea for a similar system in [[Cairo]] failed in 2004. < ref > ''[http://youthemerged.com/forums/lofiversion/index.php?t646.html Muezzins in uproar over Cairo's plan for a single call to prayer, 13. & nbsp;October 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320193248/http://youthemerged.com/forums/lofiversion/index.php?t646.html |date=2006-03-20 }}'' < /ref >
