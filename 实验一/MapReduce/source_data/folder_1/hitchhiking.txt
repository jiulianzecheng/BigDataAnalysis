 '''Hitchhiking''' is a way to end travel from place to place in someone else's car or lorry. Usually, a hitchhiker (a person who hitchhikes) will stand at the side of a road and hold his or her [[thumb]] in the air waiting for a passerby to come and pick her or him up. This is a sign that he or she wants to go somewhere else. 
 
 It was a very common way of traveling in [[Europe]] in the 1970s until people started to go missing. It is common for people to encounter rapists or lunatics while hitchiking, it is not always clear when being picked up if a person is dangerous, and this make it very dangerous and has made it less popular. 
 
 Because of this, hitchhiking is illegal or restricted in many countryâ€™s and states of America.
