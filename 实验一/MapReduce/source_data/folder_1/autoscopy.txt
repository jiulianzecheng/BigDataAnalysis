'''Autoscopy''' is a term used for a sensation where a person perceives the [[environment]] from a different perspective, from a position  " outside "  of their own body. < ref name= " Blanke 2005 " > Blanke, O., Mohr, C. (2005).

Brain Research Reviews 50: 184–199. < /ref >  The term is derived from Ancient Greek:  {{Transl|grc|autós}} ({{Lang|grc|[[wikt:αὐτός#Ancient Greek|αὐτός]]}},  " self " ) and {{Transl|grc|skopós}} ({{Lang|grc|[[wikt:σκοπός#Ancient Greek|σκοπός]]}},  " watcher " ). 
 
 Autoscopy has interested people for almost as long as there are records: There are many stories in folklore and which involve autoscopy. This applies both to  [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[History of the world|modern]] [[Society|societies]].  Psychiatrists commonly come in contact with cases of autoscopy. According to [[Neurology|neurological]] research, autoscopic experiences . < ref name= " Blanke 2005 "  / >

 Usually, the following is true: 
 
 * ''disembodiment'': The person feels that their location is  " outside the body " 
 * ''People see the world from a distanced perspective'', from  " above " . Nevertheless, the focus is still on the person.  
 * ''People also see their body from that perspective'' (which is called  " autoscopy " ) 
 
 Theis made of  the Greek words {{Transl|el|autos}} ( " self " ) and {{Transl|el|skopeo}} ( " looking at " ). The autoscopic phenomenon is classified in the following six typologies: autoscopic hallucination, he-autoscopy or heautoscopic proper, feeling of a presence, [[out of body experience]], negative and inner forms of autoscopy. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Francesca Anzellotti|last2=Valeria Onofrj|last3=Valerio Maruotti|last4=Leopoldo Ricciardi|last5=Raffaella Franciotti|last6=Laura Bonanni|last7=Astrid Thomas|last8=Marco Onofrj|date=January 22, 2010|title=Autoscopic phenomena: case report and review of literature|url=|journal=Behav Brain Funct|volume=7|issue=2|page=2|doi=10.1186/1744-9081-7-2|oclc=700286150|pmc=3032659|pmid=21219608}} < /ref > 
 
 The Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, [[Lausanne]], and the Department of Neurology, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland, have reviewed some of the classical factors of autoscopy. These are sleep, drug abuse, and general anesthesia as well as neurobiology. They have compared them with recent findings on neurological and neurocognitive mechanisms of autoscopy; the reviewed data suggest that autoscopic experiences are due problems with processing information at the temporoparietal junction. < ref name= " Blanke 2005 " > Blanke, O., Mohr, C.

 Heautoscopy is a term used in psychiatry and neurology for the [[hallucination]] of  " seeing one's own body at a distance " . < ref > {{Cite journal|vauthors=Damas Mora JM, Jenner FA, Eacott SE|year=1980|title=On heautoscopy or the phenomenon of the double: Case presentation and review of the literature|journal=Br J Med Psychol|volume=53|issue=1|pages=75–83|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.1980.tb02871.x|pmid=6989391}} < /ref >  It can occur as a symptom in [[schizophrenia]] < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Blackmore S|year=1986|title=Out-of-Body Experiences in Schizophrenia: A Questionnaire Survey|url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/JNMD86.htm|journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=174|issue=10|pages=615–619|doi=10.1097/00005053-198610000-00006|pmid=3760852|s2cid=24509827}} < /ref >  and [[epilepsy]]. Heautoscopy is considered a possible explanation for [[doppelgänger]] phenomena. 
 
 The term polyopic heautoscopy refers to cases where more than one double is perceived. In 2006, Peter Brugger and his colleagues described the case of a man who experienced five doubles resulting from a tumor in his left [[temporal lobe]]. 
 
 Another related autoscopy disorder is known as negative autoscopy (or negative heautoscopy). This is a  psychological phenomenonwere  the sufferer does not see their reflection when looking in a mirror. Although the sufferer's image may be seen by others, they claim not to see it. < ref name= " Blanke 2005 " > Blanke, O., Mohr, C. (2005).
