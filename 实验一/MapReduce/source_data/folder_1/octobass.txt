 A '''octobass''' is a musical instrument. It is a giant bass with three strings. It is played with a stick like a [[double bass]]. It has the deepest sound of any [[string instrument]]. There are only seven octobass in the world and they are mostly in museums. The only full working octobass is the one in the Montreal symphony orchestra, making it the only orchestra in the world to have a octobass.
