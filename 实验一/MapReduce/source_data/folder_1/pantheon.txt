 The '''Pantheon''' < ref > {{lang-la|Pantheon}} from {{lang-gr|Πάνθειον}}. Rarely it is called ''Pantheum''. This appears in [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny's ''Natural History'']] (XXXVI.38): ''Agrippae Pantheum decoravit Diogenes Atheniensis; in columnis templi eius [[Caryatid]]es probantur inter pauca operum, sicut in fastigio posita signa, sed propter altitudinem loci minus celebrata''. < /ref >  (meaning  " Temple of all the gods " ) is a building in [[Rome]]. It was originally built as a [[temple]] to the gods of [[Ancient Rome]], and rebuilt about 126 AD during [[Hadrian]]'s reign. Today, it is not known what gods were included. 
 
 The Pantheon is the best preserved of all Roman buildings. Since it was built, it has always been used. The design of the current building is sometimes credited to [[Trajan]]'s architect [[Apollodorus of Damascus]], but it may also been Emperor [[Hadrian]]'s architects who designed it. Scholars now agree that it was not Hadrian himself who built it. < ref > Kleiner, Fred S., Christin J. Mamiya.  " Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Vol. 1 " , 2008, p. 280 < /ref >  Since the 7th century, the Pantheon has been used as a [[Roman Catholic]] [[church]]. The Pantheon is the oldest standing domed structure in Rome. The height to the [[oculus]] and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, {{convert|43.3|m|ft}}. 
 
 The Pantheon dome is the largest dome made mainly of un[[reinforced concrete]]. It does, however, contain other materials. < ref name=Moore > [http://www.romanconcrete.com/ Moore, David 1999. ''The Roman Pantheon: the triumph of concrete''] < /ref >  According to the Jutland Archaeological Society investigations, the lower section of the dome is made of concrete with alternating layers of [[brick]]s and volcanic ash ([[tuff]]). The spaces between the bricks and ash were filled with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. < ref name=Moore/ > 
 
 The term ''pantheon'' is sometimes used for a building where well-known dead people are buried.
