 The word '''savanna''' comes from a [[Panama]]nian word for [[prairie]] or plains.  
 They are covered with tall grasses. They may have scattered bushes and trees, but not enough to keep grasses from growing.   
 
 One common example of a savanna is the tropical [[grassland]], in Africa. They have seasonal rains and dry periods.  All savanna plants and trees can survive periods of [[drought]]. < ref name=bluePlanet > {{cite web|title=World Savanna Biomes|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/savanna.htm|publisher=BluePlanetBiomes|accessdate=27 April 2013}} < /ref >  During the dry season the animals migrate north to countries on the East coast. Originally the elephant herds moving up the East coast were in the tens of thousands. Sadly, the numbers of elephants now is much fewer. 
 
 Some savannas get enough rain to support a [[forest]], but the forest never happens because [[grazing]] keeps the trees from growing. Instead there is lots of [[grass]]es and other plants that can regrow from the roots. < ref > {{cite web|title=Tropical savannas|url=https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=105|publisher=Radford University|accessdate=27 April 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Africa== 
 The savannas of [[Africa]] are the best known savannas. Some [[herbivore]]s found in the savanna are [[antelope]]s, [[impala]]s, [[gazelle]]s, [[Bison|buffalo]]s, [[wildebeest]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[Rhinoceros|rhino]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[elephant]]s, and [[warthog]]s. There is also a large number of [[carnivore]]s, including cats ([[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[serval]]s), dogs ([[jackal]] < nowiki/ > s, wild dogs), and hyenas. The vegetation in Eastern Africa is also rich with grass and some scattered trees, mostly [[acacia]] trees.  The dry season is the winter: from December to February it may not rain at all.  But in the summer there is lots of rain. < ref name=bluePlanet / > 
 
 == Australia==

 Northern Australia has a large savanna zone. This area includes northern [[Western Australia]], the northern part of [[Northern Territory]] and eastern [[Queensland]]. [[Eucalyptus]] trees are the main tree in the Australian savanna. There are many species of kangaroos but not much else. < ref name=bluePlanet / >  Some savannas in Australia have regularly spaced trees. They are sometimes known as  " [[the bush]] " .  
 
 Savannas in Australia can also be found in the southern parts of the country, from northeastern [[New South Wales]] in the [[subtropics]] to northern [[Victoria (Australian state)|Victoria]] in the [[temperate]] zone. In the southwest, however, they change into [[chaparral]] (i.e. Mediterranean shrublands) and semi-desert bush. 
 
 ==North America==

 In [[North America]], the word savanna is also used to describe the [[prairie|tall grass prairies]] that have scattered trees, typically oaks.  This is a [[temperate]] climate (colder than the tropics).  It is called an ''oak savanna'' since the oak tree is the main tree.  At least half of the view of the sky must be open.  If there are more trees, then it is called a grove or a woodland.  If there are fewer trees, it is a prairie. If there are many kinds of trees and brush and very little grass, then it is a forest.   
 
 Oak savannas are found in [[California]] and [[Oregon]] on the west coast.  In the southwest it is found in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and northern [[Mexico]].  In the midwest it is found in the tall-grass prairie.  Often a grove or a savanna is east of a river, which stopped the fire often enough to let trees grow. Large oak trees will survive grass fires.   
 
 The savannas in the midwest of the United States are kept open by regular fires, not because it is too dry for many trees. < ref > {{cite web|title=Oak Savannas - characteristics and restoration|url=http://oaksavannas.org/|publisher=OakSavanna.org|accessdate=27 April 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 ==South America== 
 Brazil's ''cerrado'' is an open woodland of short twisted trees. The are many kinds of plants and animals here, many that don't exist anywhere else on earth. 
 The ''llanos'' of the Orinoco basin of [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] are grass savannas, some parts of it get flooded every year.
