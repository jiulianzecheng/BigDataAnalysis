 '''Vellum''' is a high-quality form of [[parchment]]. Originally, it meant [[calf]] [[skin]], but in English the term is used more widely. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/vellum|title=vellum - Origin and meaning of vellum by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}} < /ref > 
 
 Like parchment, the skin is prepared to take [[writing]] in ink. < ref name= " archives.gov " > {{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/paper-vellum.html|title=Differences between Parchment, Vellum and Paper|date=15 August 2016|website=National Archives}} < /ref >  It was one of the standard writing surfaces used in Europe before [[paper]] became available. It continued to be used for high-status documents. The vellum was used for single pages, scrolls, [[Codex|codices]] or books. 
 
 To manufacture vellum, the skin is cleaned, then [[bleach]]ed, stretched on a frame called a  " herse " , and scraped with a knife. When vellum is scraped, it is by turns wet and dry to create [[tension]]. A final finish is got by rubbing the surface with [[pumice]], and treating it with lime or chalk. Then it is ready to accept ink. < ref name= " archives.gov " / > 
 
 Modern  " paper vellum "  (sometimes called vegetable vellum) is made out of [[synthetic]] material instead of mammal skin, but is used for the same purpose as normal vellum. 
 
 ==Use in the past== 
 In ancient Europe, vellum meant good quality prepared animal skin. [[Calf|Calves]], sheep, goat and even camel are known to have been used to make vellum. The very best vellum was made from unborn animals. It can be hard to identify the animal used to make old vellum without using a [[science]] lab. 
 
 French sources defined velum (or velin in French) as made from calves only. < ref > Young, Laura A. 1995 ''Bookbinding  &  conservation by hand: a working guide'', Oak Knoll Press. {{ISBN|1-884718-11-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-884718-11-3}}  [https://books.google.com/books?id=G7tUPQdT2hcC & dq=sheep+vellum & pg=PA29 Google books] < /ref >  This has remained true in modern times. 
 
 === Usage === 
 Most of the best sort of medieval manuscripts were written on vellum. Some [[Buddhist]] texts were written on vellum, and all Sifrei [[Torah]] texts are written on vellum or something similar. 
 
 A quarter of the 180 copy edition of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s first [[Gutenberg Bible|Bible]] printed in 1455 was also printed on vellum, presumably because his costumers expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing at the time. 
 
 In art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before [[canvas]] became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and [[watercolour]]s. [[Old master print]]s were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century. 
 
 Limp vellum or limp-parchment bindings was used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes gilt. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but mainly it is not, as many people like its faint grain and hair markings. 
 
 Many documents that needed to last long were written in vellum as it was able to last longer than paper. Some vellum-written documents are more than a thousand years old. 
 
 ==Modern usage== 
 British [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] are still printed on vellum for archival purposes, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/502342.stm|title=BBC News - UK Politics - Goat skin tradition wins the day|website=news.bbc.co.uk}} < /ref >  as are those of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Houses of the Oireachtas - Tithe an Oireachtais < !-- Bot generated title -- > |publisher=|access-date=2013-05-31|archive-date=2012-04-18|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/671a1xfLj?url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It is still used for Jewish scrolls, for luxury book covers, [[memorial book]]s, and for various documents in [[calligraphy]]. 
 
 Today, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. Only one UK company still supplies them. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.williamcowley.co.uk/|title=William Cowley Parchment Makers - Our Parchment  &  Vellum is used for: Calligraphy and Illumination, Bookbinding, Botanical Art, Heraldic Art, Memorial Books, Drum Making and Lampshades. Bespoke vellum covering service for furniture and wall  &  door panels. Document printing service for Certificates, Diplomas, Family Trees|website=www.williamcowley.co.uk}} < /ref >  A modern vellum-like alternative is made out of [[cotton]]. Known as paper vellum, this material is cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and crafting supply stores. Some brands of [[writing paper]] and other sorts of paper use the term  " vellum "  to suggest quality. 
 
 In the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and [[bookbinding]],  " vellum "  is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called  " parchment " . < ref > Johnston E. 1906. ''Writing, illuminating, and lettering''; Lamb C.M. (ed) 1956. ''The calligrapher's handbook''. < /ref > 
 
 === Paper vellum === 
 '''Paper vellum''' is made from cotton. Usually translucent, paper vellum in various [[Paper size|sizes]] is often used in applications where tracing is required, such as [[architectural plan]]s. Like natural vellum, the paper vellum is more stable than paper, which is frequently critical in the development of large drawings and plans such as [[blueprint]]s. 
 
 ==Storage== 
 Vellum is typically stored in a stable environment with a stable temperature. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to [[mechanical stress]]es; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to [[mold]] or [[fungus]] growth. < ref > Hansen, Eric F.  and Lee, Steve N. 1991. The effects of relative humidity on some physical properties of modern vellum: implications for the optimum relative humidity for the display and storage of parchment. ''The Book and Paper Group Annual''. < /ref >  The best temperature for the preservation of vellum is 20 & nbsp;± & nbsp;1.5 & nbsp;°C (68 & nbsp;± & nbsp;3 & nbsp;°F)
