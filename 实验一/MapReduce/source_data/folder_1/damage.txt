 In English, the word '''damage''' has different, but related meanings: 
 
 # If [[Force|physical force]] is applied to an object, this may change the object. It is possible that the object or [[tool]] does no longer work the same way as it did before. The force that was applied, ''caused damage''. Making the object work again is called ''repairing'' it or ''mending'' it. 
 # If a [[living thing]] suffers damage, people usually talk about an [[injury]]. 
 # In the sense of the [[law]], damage can also mean that someone can no longer pursue an [[Economics|economic interest]], because of something that happened. Depending on the circumstances, the one who caused the damage may be required to repair it.
