 '''Poliomyelitis''', or '''polio''', is a [[virus (biology)|virus]] that causes a serious [[infectious disease|disease]]. It is [[Infectious disease|spread from person to person]]. < ref name= " Harrison " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54501403|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub.

 Most of the time, polio has no [[symptom]]s unless the polio virus gets into the [[blood]]. < ref name= " Sherris " > {{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi00kjry|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-8385-8529-9|edition=4th|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi00kjry/page/n552 535]–7|chapter=Enteroviruses}} < /ref >  It is uncommon for the virus to enter the [[central nervous system|brain or spinal cord]]. If this does happen, it can cause [[muscle|muscles]] to become [[paralysis|paralyzed]]. Some people get better from the paralysis. Others will be [[disabled]]. Depending on which muscles have been affected, these people may need a [[mobility aid]] or a [[wheelchair]]; they may have difficulty using their hands; or they may even have trouble [[breathing]].   
 
 About 15 out of every 10,000 adults who get polio die.  (This means an adult has a 0.015% chance of dying from polio.)  
 
 [[Vaccination]] with [[polio vaccine]]s could stop the disease all over the world. Organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] have been trying to vaccinate as many people as possible against polio. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Heymann D |title=Global polio eradication initiative | url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext & pid=S0042-96862006000800006 & lng=en & nrm=iso & tlng=en |journal=Bull.

 Worldwide, polio has become much less common in the past few [[Decade|decades]].  In 1988, there were about 350,000 cases of polio in the world.  By 2007, the number of cases of polio in the world had decreased by over 99.9%, to just 1,652 cases. < ref name= " eradication " > {{cite journal |title=Update on vaccine-derived polioviruses |journal=MMWR Morb.

 The disease is preventable with the [[polio vaccine]]; however, multiple doses are required for it to be effective. The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends polio vaccination boosters for travellers and those who live in countries where the disease is endemic. 
 
 The 32nd [[President of the United States of America|President of the United States]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], had polio.  So far, he is the only President of the United States to have had this disease. 
 
 == Prevention == 
 The way to prevent polio has been known for many years: 
 
 1. Vaccine given 6, 12 and 16 weeks old as part of a six-in-one vaccine. 
 
 2. Three years and four months old as part of a 4-in-one pre-school booster 
 
 3. 14 years old as a part of the 3-in-one teenage booster. 
 
 The child has to have ALL of these to be fully protected.  
 This complicated list explains why polio is still around. In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect virtually the entire human population. < ref name=McGraw > {{cite book | veditors = Parker SP |title=McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science  &  Technology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-07-052659-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mcgrawhillconcis00park/page/67 67] |url=https://archive.org/details/mcgrawhillconcis00park/page/67 }} < /ref > < ref > Kew O.M, Sutter R.W, de Gourville E.M, Dowdle W.R, Pallansch M.A. 2005.
