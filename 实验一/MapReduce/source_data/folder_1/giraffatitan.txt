 '''''Giraffatitan''''' ( " giraffe titan " ) is a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. It lived during the [[Upper Jurassic]], about 140 [[million]] years ago. < ref > {{cite book|last=Potter, Christopher 2010. ''You are here: a portable history of the universe'' |title= You Are Here: A Portable History of the Universe|date= 2009|publisher=HarperCollins| pages=26|isbn=978-0061137877}} < /ref >  It was related to ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', and was one of the largest animals known to have walked the Earth. 
 
 Giraffatitans were about {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=on}} long and weighed about {{convert|40|t|lb}}. They had very long [[neck]]s. They were obviously adapted for feeding on tall [[conifers]]. These were the main trees in the Jurassic forests. They lived in what is now [[Tanzania]]. < ref > {{cite book|last= Paul, Gregory S. 2010.

 The specimen was first named as an African [[species]] of ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' (''B. brancai'') in 1914. < ref name=janensch1914 > Janensch W. 1914.

 == Size == 
 Several giant [[titanosaur]]ians appear to surpass ''Giraffatitan'' in sheer mass. However, ''Giraffatitan'' and ''Brachiosaurus'' are still the largest brachiosaurid sauropods known from relatively complete material. 
 
 All size estimates for ''Giraffatitan'' are based on the skeleton mounted in Berlin, which is partly constructed from authentic bones. These were largely taken from specimen HMN SII, a subadult individual between {{convert|21.8|-|22.46|m|ft}} in length and about twelve meters (forty feet) tall. < ref name= " Mazzettaetal2004 " > {{cite journal|last=Mazzetta|first=G.V.|s2cid=56028251|title=Giants and Bizarres: body size of some southern South American Cretaceous dinosaurs. |journal=Historical Biology|year=2004|pages=1–13|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1080/08912960410001715132|volume=16|issue=2–4|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.1650}} < /ref >
