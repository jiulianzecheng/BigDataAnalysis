 The southern part of the resort town is bordered by the spurs of the ridge, which is covered with [[Conifer|coniferous vegetation]] and shrubs: mountain ash, and bird cherry.

 In the 1920s, a resort village was founded on the site of the village of New Belokurikha. An office, a canteen, an outpatient clinic, and a solarium were built here, and in 1928 a hydropathic center for 24 baths and a polyclinic was built, and wooden dormitory buildings were erected between 1931-1934.{{fact|date=January 2021}} The leaders of the Soviet state and their wives were resting here, as was the Russian writer K.G. Paustovsky.

 === Climatotherapy === 
 It is characterized by a relatively high average annual air temperature (+4° C) for Siberia. Mild winters, non-hot summers, warm weather in spring and autumn months, mostly windless, short-term frosts in winter, alternating with frequent thaws and constant barometric pressure. 
 
 === Mountain air === 
 Light air ions are the main healing component of mountain air. In Belokurikha, the content of light air ions is from 1014 to 2400, which is twice their content in the world-famous [[Switzerland|Swiss]] resort of [[Davos]]. Increased air [[Ion|ionization]] is especially noted on adjacent hills and terraces. 
 
 === Thermal waters === 
 Sources in Belokurikha are thermal nitrogen-siliceous radon-containing waters or nitrogen therms. They surface at a temperature of 30° C and 42° C. They contain a small amount of [[radon]], a lot of [[nitrogen]], [[fluorine]], and [[silicic acid]], as well as various trace elements ([[Alkaline]] and [[mineral water]]). Healing mud from salt lakes of the Altai Territory is also used. 
 
 === Skiing === 
 At the beginning of 2010, the resort had three main ski slopes equipped: Katun, the central slope of the resort, measuring 800 meters long, Severny at 650 meters long, and mount, at 2050 meters long.
