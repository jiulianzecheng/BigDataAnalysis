 '''Albury''' ({{lang-wrh|Bungambrawatha}}) is a city in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is on the [[Hume Highway]] that runs between [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]]. The [[Murray River]] separates Albury from [[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]]. Albury is on the north side of the Murray River. The river is also the border between [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]]. It is about 550 [[Kilometre|km]] from the state [[Capital (city)|capital]] [[Sydney]], but only 312 km from the [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]] capital [[Melbourne]]. Albury is believed to have been named after Aldbury in Hertfordshire. < ref name=gnb > {{NSW GNR|id =MnqwlM |title = Albury, New South Wales|date =5 August 1994 |accessdate =1 August 2013 }} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Indigenous Australian|Australian Aboriginal]] people called the area Bungambrewatha. < ref name=gnb/ >  There are a number of historical aboriginal sites including rock paintings. There are also scarred trees, where the bark has been removed to make [[shield]]s and [[canoe]]s. < ref name= " waw " > {{cite web|url=http://www.albury-wodonga.com/docs/history.htm|title=History|work=Welcome to Albury-Wodonga|access-date=2009-10-31}} < /ref >  The rich river flats would have provided food for native animals, and the wetlands would have been home to large numbers of water birds. 
 
 The first [[Europe]]ns to arrive in the area were the explorers, [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] in 1824. < ref name=waw/ >  They made their mark in a tree on the riverbank which later became the spot where people heading south would cross the river. < ref name =waw/ >  Crossing the river was easy in summer when the water level was low. By 1844 a [[ferry]] was built to carry people over the river all year. < ref name=waw/ >  There were soon many farmers moving into the area with large flocks of sheep. Some of the first in Albury were William Wyse and Charles Ebden.
