 '''''Heidi''''' is a book written by [[Johanna Spyri]], published between [[1880]] and [[1881]]. It is about a young orphan girl who grows up in the [[Swiss Alps]] (mountains in [[Switzerland]]) with her grandfather. 
 
 == Summary == 
 When her guardians die, Heidi must live in the mountains with her grandfather, Alm-Uncle, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.authorama.com/heidi-2.html|title=Chapter 1: Up the Mountain to Alm-Uncle}} < /ref >  who does not like people. He slowly changes and becomes more caring because of Heidi. Then, Heidi must move to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] to be the friend of Clara, a girl who is sick and cannot walk. Clara’s grandmother encourages Heidi to learn to read, and she also learns about God. She becomes very homesick, and a kind doctor says that she must return home to her grandfather. Later, Clara visits Heidi in the Alps and becomes strong enough to walk. 
 
 == Inspiration == 
 Johanna Spyri wrote this story for her son, Berhard Diethelm Spyri. People and places in the story come from Spyry's own life. Catherine Eayrs, a [[critic|literary critic]], thinks that the village of Dorfli may come from [[Jenins]] in Switzerland, a place that Spyri visited as a child, however Dorfli is an actual town in Switzerland. Also, the kindly doctor is similar to Spyri's own father, and Klara's grandmother is a good storyteller, just like Spyri's own mother. < ref > Eayrs, Catherine.  " Johanna Spyri. "  In Jane M.

 == Reception == 
 Immediately after the book was published, ''Heidi'' was popular, both with children and adults. It continues to be popular, and [[translation]]s are available in more than fifty languages. About 50 million books have been sold. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.heidi-swiss.ch/en/heididorf/geschichte.html |title=Willkommen im Heidi-Dorf! |access-date=2009-04-12 |archive-date=2009-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003359/http://www.heidi-swiss.ch/en/heididorf/geschichte.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The story has also been told on [[movie]] and [[television]]. There is even a [[musical]] version. 
 
 Visitors to Switzerland can visit a [[tourist]] village called Heididorf in [[Maienfeld]]. < ref > {{in lang|en}}[http://en.graubuenden.ch/highlights-switzerland/highlights/heidi.html Sightseeing Switzerland on state tourism site]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The name means  " Heidi's village "  in German. 
 
 == Criticism == 
 Some readers think that one problem of ''Heidi'' is that the book teaches the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion. Malcolm Usrey, a literary critic, thinks that [[nature]] is as important as Christianity in helping people, because Klara’s [[paralysis]] and Heidi’s home sickness are both healed in the “clean air of the Swiss mountains”. < ref > Malcolm Usrey,  " Johanna Spryi's Heidi: The conversation of a Byronic Hero "  in Anne H. Lundin (ed), 2004, ''Constructing the Canon of Children's Literature'', Routledge. pg 103 < /ref >
