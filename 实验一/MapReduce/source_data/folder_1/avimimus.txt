 '''''Avimimus''''' (meaning  " bird mimic " ) was a recently discovered [[maniraptora]]n. < ref name= " ageofdinosaursavimimus " > 'Avimimus'. In: Dodson, Peter et al. ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Publications International. p130. {{ISBN|0-7853-0443-6}}. < /ref >  It was a very fast moving, light-weight, [[bird]]-like [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in the late [[Cretaceous]] in what is now [[Mongolia]], around 70 million years ago. that may have had [[feather]]s. There are two known species, '''''Avimimus portentosus''''' and '''''Avimimus nemegtensis'''''.

 The forelimbs were relatively short. The bones of the hand were fused together, as in modern birds, and a ridge on the [[ulna]] (lower arm bone) was interpreted as an attachment point for feathers by Kurzanov. < ref name= " ageofdinosaursavimimus " / > < ref name= " kurzanov1981 " > Kurzanov S.M. 1981.
