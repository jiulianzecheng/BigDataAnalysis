 A '''Khachkar''' or '''Khatchkar''' ( " Խաչքար "  in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], meaning '' " cross-stone " '', pronounced as {{IPA2|χɑtʃkɑɹ}}) is a carved memorial stone found in [[Armenia]]. 
 
 It has a crucifix or cross, with a rosette or sun circle below it. Other parts can be filled with patterns of leaves, grapes or knots. Sometimes it has a ledge at the top with saints' or characters from the bible. 
 
 Much of the time a khachkar is put up for religious reasons such as the [[salvation]] of the soul of a living or a dead person. They have also been removed for other reasons, such as to show a [[military]] win, building of a new church, or as a protection from natural disasters. 
 
 Most Khachkars are in [[Cemetery|graveyards]]. But Armenian gravestones take many other forms, and only a small are khatchkars.
