'''Annihilationism''' (also called '''conditional immortality''') is something that some [[Christians]] believe. People who are annihilationists believe that those who do not go to heaven do not live forever in [[hell]], but instead die and no longer exist. (Annihilationists often believe that people are punished for a period of time in hell before they stop existing). Most Christians are not annihilationists. Famous Christian writers who have written in favor of annihilationism include [[Edward Fudge]], [[John Wenham]], and [[Clark Pinnock]]. Christians who have written against annihilationism include [[J.P. Moreland]], [[Robert Peterson]], and [[Ron Rhodes]]. 
 
 Groups that believe in annihilationism include [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].
