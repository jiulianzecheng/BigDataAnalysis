The '''circumflex''' ('''^'''), also known as the '''caret''', is a [[diacritic]] used in [[French language|French]] and a few other languages. It is like a little hat over a [[vowel]]. Originally, the circumflex was an [[acute accent]] and a [[grave accent]] put together. 
 
 In French, the circumflex usually shows the loss of letter, usually the loss of the letter [[S]]. Example: maistre (Middle French)  >  maître (modern French). From here, its function is historical. 
 
 Also, less often, the circumflex is used to distinguish between [[homophone]]s. These are words spelt the same, but with different meanings. Example: ''sur'' = on, but ''sûr'' = safe or certain. In those cases the [[pronunciation]] of the two words may be different.
