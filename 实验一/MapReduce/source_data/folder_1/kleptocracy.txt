'''Kleptocracy''' ('klepto' meaning '[[theft]]' in [[Ancient Greek]]) is the ruling of possibly any kind of [[government]] that uses its power to steal from its people.  This rarely-applied word was used by Charles Krauthammer, the nationally syndicated Washington Post columnist and political commentator on Fox-TV, on Saturday, March 2, and Sunday, March 3, 2014.  He referred to Russia as a ''kleptocracy'' in a TV panel discussion about its influence in the revolution in the neighboring Ukraine in late February.  His political column added another derivation of this word: ''kleptocratic''. 
 
 " Kleptocratic "  is used by Krauthammer in the following quote:  " But surely the West has more financial clout than Russia's '''kleptocratic''' extraction economy that exports little but oil, gas and wisky. "
