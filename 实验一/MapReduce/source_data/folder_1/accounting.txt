 '''Accounting''' or '''accountancy''' is the [[job]] of sharing financial information about a [[business]] to [[manager]]s and [[shareholder]]s (people who have invested in the business). < ref > Elliot, Barry  &  Elliot, Jamie: ''Financial accounting and reporting'', [[Prentice Hall]], London 2004, {{ISBN|0-273-70364-1}}, p. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=82B1L70-xrsC & dq=Financial%20accounting%20and%20reporting & pg=PA3 Google Books] < /ref >  Accounting is often called the  " language of business " . '''Accountants''' are people who do accounting, and also carry out the [[audit]]ing or checking of a company's books and records. In [[Britain]], this auditing is often carried out by a qualified person called a  " [[chartered accountant]] " . In the United States, the professional designation is Certified Public Accountant or  " CPA " . < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.aicpa.org/becomeacpa/gettingstarted/frequentlyaskedquestions.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions FAQs - Become a CPA|website=AICPA|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}} < /ref > 
 
 When accountants do accounting work, they write in the books of account ([[ledger]]s) that belong to a company. Every time money is spent or [[wikt:earned|earned]], it is written in the ledger. The information in the ledger is used to prepare the company accounts monthly, quarterly (every three months) and annually (every year). These annual accounts show what money the company has taken in over time and what it has spent money on. It also shows if the company made a profit in the year (if it made more money than it spent), who owes the company money, who the company owes money to, and any big expensive items the company has bought which they expect to use for many years. Lenders, managers, investors, tax authorities (the people who collect taxes for the government) and other decision-makers look at these annual accounts. Managers and investors look at the ledger and make decisions about how to spend money in the future. Lenders like banks look at the accounts before they lend money to the company. Tax authorities look at them to check that the company is paying the correct amount of taxes. 
 
 == Where the word comes from == 
 The word ''accountant'' originally comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''computare'' –  " to reckon, count, number " , via [[French language|French]]. 
 
 " Accomptant "  was the original spelling and pronunciation of the word  " accountant " . However, over time, people began to drop the  " p "  in the word  " accomptant " . Over time, the word changed both in the way it was said and [[orthography|spelled]] to how it is today. < ref > {{cite book|last=Pixley|first=Francis William|title=Accountancy –Constructive and Recording Accountancy|publisher=Sir Isaac Pitman  &  Sons, Ltd.|location=London|date=1900|page=4|url=https://archive.org/download/accountancyconst00pixluoft/accountancyconst00pixluoft.pdf}} < /ref > 
 
 == Accounting theory == 
 The basic accounting equation is assets=liabilities+equity. < ref > Schmidgall, Raymond S; David K. Hayes  &  Jack D. Ninemeier 2002. ''Restaurant financial basics''. John Wiley, Hoboken New Jersey, page 21. < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 === Early history === 
 Accountancy is very old. It started when [[human]]s first started to [[farming|farm]] and form [[town]]s and [[city|cities]]. People who thought about economics (keeping track of money and valuable things) thought of a way to write down the sizes and values of [[crops]]. 
 
 ===Token accounting in ancient Mesopotamia=== 
 [[File:Map of fertile crescent.svg|thumb|right|180px|Map of the Middle East showing the Fertile Crescent circa [[3rd millennium BC]]]] 
 The earliest accounting records were found among the ruins of ancient [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]] and [[Sumer]]ia, which are more than 7,000 years old. The people of that time relied on primitive accounting methods to record the growth of crops and herds. Because there is a natural season for farming and herding, it is easy to count and determine if a [[Economic surplus|surplus]] had been gained after the crops had been harvested or the young animals weaned. < ref name= " Friedlob, G. Thomas 1996, p.1 " / >

 The invention of a form of [[bookkeeping]] using clay tokens represented a huge [[cognitive]] leap for mankind. < ref > Oldroyd, David  &  Dobie, Alisdair: ''Themes in the history of bookkeeping'', The Routledge Companion to Accounting History, London, July 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-415-41094-6}}, Chapter 5, p. 96 < /ref > 
 
 In the twelfth-century A.D., the [[Islamic economics in the world|Arab writer]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], wrote a book called ''[[Hisbah (business accountability)|Hisba]]''. This book has details about accounting systems that were used by [[Muslims]] before the mid-seventh century A.D. Muslim accounting was influenced (changed) by Romans and [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. In his book, Ibn Taymiyyah gives details of a complex governmental accounting system. 
 
 ===Accounting in the Roman Empire=== 
 [[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Part of the ''Res Gestae Divi Augusti'' from the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (Temple of Augustus and Rome) at [[Ancyra]], built between 25 BCE - 20 BCE.]] 
 The ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' ([[Latin]]:  " The Deeds of the Divine Augustus " ) is a remarkable account to the Roman people of the Emperor [[Augustus]]' stewardship. It listed and quantified his public expenditure, which encompassed distributions to the people, grants of land or money to army veterans, subsidies to the ''[[aerarium]]'' (treasury), building of temples, religious offerings, and expenditures on theatrical shows and [[gladiatorial]] games. It was not an account of state revenue and expenditure, but was designed to demonstrate Augustus' munificence. The significance of the ''Res Gestae Divi Augusti'' from an accounting perspective lies in the fact that it illustrates that the [[Executive (government)|executive authority]] had access to detailed financial information, covering a period of some forty years, which was still retrievable after the event. The scope of the accounting information at the emperor's disposal suggests that its purpose encompassed planning and decision-making. < ref > {{Cite web|last=abbas|first=kashif|date=2023-09-02|title=ACCOUNTING SERVICES|url=https://hmaa.ae/accounting.html|access-date=2023-02-09|archive-date=2023-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230209090913/https://hmaa.ae/accounting.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The Roman historians [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] record that in [[23 BC]], [[Augustus]] prepared a ''rationarium'' (account) which listed public revenues, the amounts of cash in the ''aerarium'' (treasury), in the provincial ''fisci'' (tax officials), and in the hands of the ''[[publicani]]'' (public contractors); and that it included the names of the freedmen and slaves from whom a detailed account could be obtained. The closeness of this information to the executive authority of the emperor is attested by [[Tacitus]]' statement that it was written out by Augustus himself. < ref > {{Cite web|last=abbas|first=kashif|date=June 14, 2016|title=ACCOUNTING SERVICES|url=https://hmaa.ae/accounting.html|access-date=2023-02-09|archive-date=2023-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230208204336/https://hmaa.ae/accounting.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  [[File:Roman writing tablet 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Roman writing tablet from the Vindolanda Roman fort of [[Hadrian's Wall]], in [[Northumberland]] (1st-2nd century AD) requesting money to buy 5,000 measures of cereal used for brewing beer. Department of Prehistory and Europe, [[British Museum]].]] 
 
 Records of [[cash]], [[commodities]], and transactions were kept scrupulously by military personnel of the [[Roman army]]. An account of small cash sums received over a few days at the [[fort]] of [[Vindolanda]] circa [[110]] CE shows that the fort could compute [[revenues]] in cash on a daily basis, perhaps from sales of surplus supplies or goods manufactured in the camp, items dispensed to slaves such as ''cervesa'' ([[beer]]) and ''clavi caligares'' ([[Nail (fastener)|nails]] for boots), as well as commodities bought by individual soldiers. The basic needs of the fort were met by a mixture of direct [[manufacturing|production]], [[purchase]] and [[requisition]]; in one letter, a request for money to buy 5,000 ''modii'' (measures) of ''braces'' (a cereal used in brewing) shows that the fort bought provisions for a considerable number of people. < ref > Bowman, Alan K., ''Life and letters on the Roman frontier: Vindolanda and its people'' [[Routledge]], London, January 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-415-92024-7}}, p. 40-41,45 < /ref > 
 
 The [[Heroninos Archive]] is the name given to a huge collection of [[papyrus]] documents, mostly letters, but also including a fair number of accounts, which come from [[Roman Egypt]] in 3rd century CE. The bulk of the documents relate to the running of a large, private [[Estate (house)|estate]] < ref > Farag, Shawki M., ''The accounting profession in Egypt: Its origin and development'', [[University of Illinois]], 2009, p.7 [http://www.aucegypt.edu/academics/facultyresearch/Profiles/Documents/Science%20paper,%20Shawki%20Farag.pdf Aucegypt.edu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528121050/http://www.aucegypt.edu/academics/facultyresearch/Profiles/Documents/Science%20paper,%20Shawki%20Farag.pdf |date=2010-05-28 }} < /ref >  is named after Heroninos because he was ''phrontistes'' ([[Koine Greek]]: [[Management|manager]]) of the estate which had a complex and standardised system of accounting which was followed by all its local farm managers. < ref > Rathbone, Dominic: ''Economic Rationalism and Rural Society in Third-Century AD Egypt: The Heroninos Archive and the Appianus Estate'', [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-03763-8}}, 1991, p.4 < /ref >  Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his own little accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as pieces of papyrus [[scroll]] into one big yearly account for each particular sub—division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave the owner the opportunity to take better [[economic]] decisions because the information was purposefully selected and arranged. < ref > Cuomo,Serafina: ''Ancient mathematics'', [[Routledge]], London, {{ISBN|978-0-415-16495-5}}, July 2001, p.231 < /ref > 
 
 === Luca Pacioli and modern accountancy === 
 [[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|right|300px|{{center|1=Painting of Luca Pacioli, thought to be painted by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]]}}]] 
 [[Luca Pacioli]] (1445–1517), < ref > Los, Cornelis A. Computational Finance: A Scientific Perspective WorldScientificPublishingCo 2001 page 23 < /ref >  also known as Friar Luca dal Borgo, is said to be the  " Father "  of accountancy. < ref > Ramachandran, N; Ram Kumar Kakani Financial Accounting for Management Tata McGraw-Hill 2005 page 5 < /ref >  He wrote a [[textbook]] in Latin called ''Summa de arithmetica, geometrica, proportioni et proportionalita'' (''[[Summa]] on arithmetic, geometry, proportions and proportionality'', [[Venice]] 1494). This textbook was used in the abbaco schools in northern Italy. Sons of [[merchant]]s and [[craftsman|craftsmen]] were taught in these schools. This textbook was written about math. It has the first printed description of how merchants from Venice kept their accounts. Merchants from Venice used a system called the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]]. 
 
 Double-entry bookkeeping is where there is a debit and credit entry for every transaction. < ref > Mills, Geofrey T.  " Early accounting in Northern Italy: The role of commercial development and the printing press in the expansion of double-entry from Genoa, Florence and Venice "  (The Accounting Historians Journal, June 1994) < /ref > 
 
 Pacioli wrote down this system but he did not invent it, but he is still called the  " Father of Accounting " . The system he wrote had most of the [[accounting cycle]] as it is known today. He wrote about using journals and ledgers, and warned that a person should not go to sleep at night until the debits were the same as the credits. His ledger had accounts for assets (things that have value), liabilities (debts and loans that are to be paid to someone else), capital (money), income and expenses. He showed how to write year-end closing entries and suggested that a [[trial balance]] be used to prove that a ledger is balanced. His treatise (long essay) in the book also has info about other topics, such as accounting ethics and cost accounting. 
 
 === Post-Pacioli === 
 The first book written in the [[English language]] on accounting was published in [[London]], [[England]] by [[John Gouge]] in 1543. < ref > Rambaud, Salvador Cruz; Jose Garcia Perez; Robert A. Nehmer Algebraic Models for Accounting Systems WorldScientific Publishing Co. page 2 < /ref > 
 
 In 1588 [[John Mellis]] from [[Southwark]], [[England]] wrote a short book of instructions for keeping accounts. < ref > Editors-in-Chief John D. Long and William P. Wilson The American Business Encyclopedia and Legal Adviser JB Millett Co Boston 1913 page 20 < /ref > 
 
 There was another book written in 1635 that was described as ''The Merchants Mirrour, or directions for the perfect ordering and keeping of his accounts formed by way of Debitor and Creditor''. This book was written by Richard Dafforne, who was an accountant. This book has many references to books about accountancy that were written much earlier. One chapter of this book is titled  " Opinion of Book-keeping's Antiquity " . In this chapter the author says that, according to another author, the bookkeeping he wrote about was used two-hundred years earlier in Venice. 
 
 There were several editions of Richard Dafforne's book. The second edition was published in 1636. The third edition was published in 1656. Another edition was published in 1684. The book is very complete in how it describes [[Science|scientific]] accountancy. It contains a lot of detail and explanation. The science that supports accountancy was liked by many people in the seventeenth century. This is supported by the fact that there were so many editions. Starting at this point in history, there have been many books written about accountancy. Many authors claim to be professional accountants and teachers of accountancy. Because of this, it shows that there were professional accountants who were employed in the seventeenth century. 
 
 == Types of accounting == 
 * [[Financial accounting]] is  " a major branch of accounting involving the collection, recording and extraction of financial information, and the summary of it in the form of a periodic profit and loss account, a balance sheet and a cash flow statement in accordance with legal, professional, and capital market requirements " . < ref > [http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/1065/1090612/glossary.html Glossary] at wps.pearsoned.co.uk < /ref > 
 * [[Management accounting]] is a type of accounting involving partners helping each other in management decision making, creating management systems for planning and performance, and using financial reporting to help design a company's accounting strategy for the future. < ref > Needles, Belverd E. ;Marian Powers; Susan V. Crosson Financial and Managerial Accounting 9th Edition Southwestern Cengage Learning 2011  page 720 < /ref > 
 * [[Open-book accounting]] is an accounting [[principle]]. This principle requires the parties in an economic relationship to show their accounting books to each other. < ref > Hoque, Zahirul Handbook of Cost and Management Accounting Spiramus Press London 2005 page 264 < /ref > 
 * [[Tax accounting]] is a type of accounting that makes sure tax laws are followed. 
 * [[Accounting scholarship]] studies the theory of accountancy. 
 
 A [[financial audit]] is where an [[internal audit]] and an [[external audit]] are done. For an external audit, an independent (unrelated) [[auditor]] takes a look at financial statements and accounting records. By looking at these records, the auditor can find out if these records are true, fair and follow [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP), or [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS). ''Internal audit'' tries to get info for management usage, and is done by employees. 
 
 == Research == 
 Accounting research is [[research]] in the effects of economic events on the process of accounting, the effects of reported information on economic events, and the roles of accounting in organizations and society. < ref name= " Burchell et al 1980 " > {{cite journal |last1=Burchell |first1=S. |last2=Clubb |first2=C. |last3=Hopwood |first3=A. |last4=Hughes |first4=J. |last5=Nahapiet |first5=J. |title=The roles of accounting in organizations and society |journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society |date=1980 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–27|doi=10.1016/0361-3682(80)90017-3 }} < /ref >  It encompasses a broad range of research areas including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]] and [[taxation]]. < ref name =  " OOS 2010 " > Oler, Derek K., Mitchell J.
