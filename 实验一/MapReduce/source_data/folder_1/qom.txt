'''Qom''' is the second religious city of [[Iran]] and one of the bases of [[Shi'ism]]. The city dates back to before the rise of [[Islam]]. The city was conquered by Muslims in [[23]]/644-645 but the people of Qom converted to Islam with the immigration of [[Ash'ariyyun]] in [[85]]/704-705, the beginning of the development of Qom as a Shi'a city was from that time. 
 
 Immigration of Lady [[Fatima al-Ma'suma (a)]] to Qom and his [[Holy Shrine of Fatima al-Ma'suma|shrine]] in the city, and after that, immigration of other [[Imam's descendant]]s and [[Sayyid]]s, made the city the base of Shi'ism in Iran. Foundation of [[Qom seminary]] added to the Shi'a fame of the city. 
 
 Today, the city is the greatest base of Shi'ism from which the Shi'a knowledge is promoted to the world.
