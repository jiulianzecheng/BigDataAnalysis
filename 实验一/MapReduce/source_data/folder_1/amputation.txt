 '''Amputation''' is the act of cutting off a part of the [[human body]], sometimes because of [[medical]] reasons. In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts was used as a form of punishment for people who committed [[Crime|crimes]]. A person who has had an arm or leg removed is known as an amputee.
