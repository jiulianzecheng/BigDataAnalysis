 '''Biomass''' is a basic term in [[ecology]], and in the [[energy]] [[production]] [[industry]]. 
 Organic waste such as dead plant and animal material, animal dung and kitchen waste can be converted into gaseous [[fuel]] called [[biogas]]. The organic waste is decomposed by [[bacteria]] in biogas digesters to emit biogas which is essentially a mixture of [[methane]] and carbon dioxide. 
 
 In '''[[ecology]]''', biomass means the accumulation of [[living]] matter. It is the total living material in a given area or a biological community or group. Biomass is measured by weight, or by dry weight, per given area (per square metre or square kilometer). 
 In the energy industry, it refers to biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production. Biomass includes [[plant]] matter grown for use as [[biofuel]], and also includes plant or animal matter used for production of [[fibre]]s, [[chemical]]s or heat. Biomass may also include [[biodegradable]] [[waste]]s which can be burnt as fuel. It excludes [[Organic matter|organic material]] which has been [[Metamorphism|transformed by geological processes]] into substances such as [[coal]] or [[petroleum]]. It is usually measured by dry weight. 
 
 == Energy industry == 
 The term '''biomass''' is especially useful for [[plant]]s, where some internal structures may not always be considered living tissue, such as the [[wood]] (secondary [[xylem]]) of a tree. 
 
 [[Biofuel]] < nowiki/ > s include bio[[ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], [[biogas]], and [[firewood]]. 
 
 Biomass is grown from several plants, including switchgrass, [[hemp]], [[maize|corn]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]] and [[sugarcane]]. < ref > [http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/bioen00/volk.html T.A. Volk ''et al'' Developing a willow biomass crop enterprise for bioenergy and bioproducts in the United States.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104073844/http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/bioen00/volk.html |date=2011-11-04 }} In: ''Proceedings of Bioenergy 2000'', October 15-19, 2000. Buffalo, New York. < /ref >  The particular plant used is usually not very important to the end products, but it does affect the processing of the raw material.  
 Though biomass is a [[renewable resource|renewable]] fuel, its use can still contribute to [[global warming]]. This happens when the natural carbon equilibrium is disturbed; for example by deforestation or urbanization of green sites. 
 
 Biomass is part of the [[carbon cycle]].   [[Photosynthesis]] converts carbon from the atmosphere into plant matter.  When the plant rots or burns, the carbon goes back into the atmosphere.  This happens somewhat quickly, and plant matter used as a fuel can be constantly replaced by planting for new growth.  Therefore, it doesn't much change the amount of atmospheric carbon. 
 
 Although [[fossil fuel]]s come from things that died long ago, they are not considered biomass by the generally accepted definition because they contain carbon that has been 'out' of the carbon cycle for a very long time.  Burning fossil fuels in combustion therefore adds much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 
 
 Other uses of biomass, besides fuel: 
 * [[Building material]] 
 * [[Paper]] (using cellulose fibres) 
 * Biodegradable plastics 
 
 Plastics from biomass, like some made to dissolve in seawater, are made the same way as petroleum-based plastics, are actually cheaper to manufacture and meet or exceed most performance standards. But they lack the water resistance of conventional plastics. < ref > [https://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20070404/sc_livescience/ohchickenfeathershowtoreduceplasticwaste;_ylt=AsoNp3lYLjTRmrSb25gq53vq188F Oh, chicken feathers!

 == Ecology == 
 The most successful [[animal]], in terms of biomass, is the [[Antarctic krill]], ''Euphausia superba'', with a biomass of probably over 500 million tons across the world, about twice the total biomass of [[human]]s.  
 Biomass may also be a measure of the dried organic mass of an [[ecosystem]].
