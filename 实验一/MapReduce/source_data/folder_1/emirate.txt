An '''emirate''' is a political [[territory]] that is ruled by an [[emir]], a [[dynasty|dynastic]] Arab [[Monarch]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emirate |title=emirate |author= |website=Cambridge Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=26 August 2016}} < /ref >  The word emirate or amirate comes from {{lang-ar|'''إمارة'''}}, ''Imaarah'' ; plural: إمارات, ''Imaraat''.  The [[United Arab Emirates]] is a federal state of seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven elect the federation's President and [[Prime Minister]]. Most emirates have either disappeared or become part of a larger modern state, some changed their rulers' title, e.g. to [[Malik]] (Arabic for King) or [[Sultan]]. Therefore true emirate-states have become rare.  
 
 In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class, especially of a member of the royal family, as in [[Saudi Arabia]]n governorates. < ref > Stig Stenslie, ''Regime Stability in Saudi Arabia: The Challenge of Succession'' (London; New York: Routledge, 2012), p. 33 < /ref >
