 [[Hinduism|Hindus]] believe that there are periods of [[time]] called '''yugas''' ( " ages "  or  " eras " ): Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and [[Kali Yuga]]. When Kali Yuga ends, a new Satya Yuga begins. 
 
 # '''Satya Yuga''' (also called '''Krita Yuga''') is the first age, which lasts for 1,728,000 years. It is  " the age of truth "  or  " Golden Age " , when all [[human]]s are good and very [[religion|religious]]. They are ruled by [[gods]] and live for many centuries. 
 # '''Treta Yuga''' is the second age, which lasts for 1,296,000 years. During the last Treta Yuga, [[god]] [[Vishnu]]'s [[avatar]]s [[Vamana]], [[Parashurama]], and [[Rama]]chandra were born. The Indian epic legend ''[[Ramayana]]'' is set in that period. 
 # '''Dvapara Yuga''' is the third age, which lasts for 864,000 years, when humans are still religious but their lives are much shorter. The last Dvapara Yuga ended with the death of [[Krishna]] and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' is set in its final years. 
 # '''Kali Yuga''' is the fourth and final age, which lasts for 432,000 years. It is the  " dark age "  when humans lose their [[spirituality]] and are abandoned by gods. Hindus believe that we currently live in a Kali Yuga.
