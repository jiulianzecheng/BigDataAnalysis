[[File:Dodecahedron light blue.svg|thumb|A dodecahedron]] 
 A '''dodecahedron''' is a [[polyhedron]] (a three-dimensional [[shape]]) that has 12 faces. Each face is a [[pentagon]] (a [[polygon]] with five edges). It has 20 corners (also called [[vertex|vertices]]) and 30 edges altogether. 
 
 A '''regular dodecahedron''', which looks exactly the same from all faces, is a [[Platonic solid]]. The [[Dual polyhedron|dual]] of a dodecahedron is an [[icosahedron]]. 
 
 ==Surface area and volume== 
 
 If ''a'' is the length of one of its edges, the [[surface area]] and [[volume]] of a regular dodecahedron are: 
 
 : < math > A = 3\sqrt{25+10\sqrt{5}} a^2 < /math > 
 : < math > V = \frac{15+7\sqrt{5}}{4} a^3 < /math >
