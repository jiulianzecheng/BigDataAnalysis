 '''Cementation''' is what makes [[rocks]] solid. It is the process where grains of [[sediment]] get stuck together. It is a [[chemical]] process, and the cement is a [[precipitation|precipitate]] which crystallises in the spaces between the [[matrix]] of grains. [[Silica]] (SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) and [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > ) are the most common types of cement. < ref > Levy H.L. 1996.

 [[Ions]] carried in groundwater precipitate to form new crystalline material in sediment pores: this is how  " sediment "  becomes  " rock " .  The new pore-filling minerals form  " bridges "  between original sediment grains, thereby binding them together. So ''[[sand]]'' becomes  " [[sandstone]] " , and ''[[gravel]]'' becomes  " [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] " .   
 
 Cementation occurs mainly below the water table. Large volumes of pore water must pass through sediment pores for new mineral cements to crystallize and so millions of years are generally required to complete the cementation process.     
 
 Sedimentation does not always occur. Many [[quarry|quarries]] used for sand and gravel have them as loose particles and stones, just as if they came from a present-day [[beach]]. In England, most of these quarries are from beds laid down in the [[Jurassic]], 150+ million years ago. By chance, the conditions for cementation never occurred there.
