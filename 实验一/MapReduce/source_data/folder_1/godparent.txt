 A '''godparent''' is an adult who [[sponsor]]s a child during a [[formal]] [[religious]] [[ceremony]] or [[rite]]. Many religions have godparents or other adults who do something almost the same. These [[religion]]s include [[Christianity]]  &  [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. < ref > https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44035986_KIRVELIK_TRADITION_IN_DIFFERENT_RELIGIOUS_GROUPS_A_RESEARCH_ON_THE_TRANSFORMATION_OF_RITUAL_KINSHIP < /ref >  Usually a godparent must be a member of the [[religion]] of the child. The role of a god parent is to also give the god [[child]] a [[gift]], [[small]] or [[big]], [[money]], [[toys]], etc. Mainly on [[Sunday]]s. 
 
 Originally a godparent was someone who agreed to help raise the child and help them to become a good member of the religion. They may also have taken over as parent to the child if both its real parents died. Today, the role of godparent is not often a formal one, and has no real responsibility to the child. A female child of a godparent is a goddaughter. A male [[child]] of a godparent is a godson.
