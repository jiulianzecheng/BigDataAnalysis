 '''Bernicia''' ([[Old English]]: ''Bernice'') was a kingdom in [[England|Northern England]]. It was an [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom established by [[Angles|Anglian]] settlers in the 6th century. Bernicia occupied about the same area as the modern English counties of [[Northumberland]] and [[County Durham|Durham]], and the former Scottish counties of [[Berwickshire]] and [[East Lothian]]. Bernicia was one of two Anglo-Saxon kingdoms located north of the [[River Humber]]. The other was [[Deira]] and in the early [[7th century]] they combined to become the kingdom of [[Northumbria]].

 The details of the arrival of the Germanic Angles in this area is not to be found in historical sources, < ref name=Higham76 > N. J.

But he had little detail on the Bernician kings before the reign of [[Athelfrith of Bernicia]] ([[:en:wikt:†|†]] 616). < ref name=Higham76/ >  Bede dated Ida's reign to starting in 547. < ref name=Stenton76 > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 76 < /ref >  He also gives the impression that the next four kings had all they could do to hold onto their territory. They had constant battles with the British during this time. < ref name=Stenton76/ >  Athelfrith was the first to expand the territory at the expense of the British. In 605 Athelfrith united the two kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira, into a single and powerful kingdom called Northumbria. < ref > C. W.
