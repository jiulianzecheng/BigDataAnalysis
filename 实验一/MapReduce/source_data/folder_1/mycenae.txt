 '''Mycenae''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μυκῆναι}} ''Mykēnai'' or  {{lang|grc|Μυκήνη}} ''Mykēnē''), is an [[archaeology|archaeological site]] in [[Greece]]. It is about 90 & nbsp;km south-west of [[Athens]], in the north-eastern [[Peloponnese]].  
 
 In the second [[millennium]] [[BC]], Mycenae was one of the most important centers of early Greek [[civilization]] with a strong army. The time of [[Greece|Greek history]] from about 1600 BC to about 1100 BC is called [[Mycenaean Greece]]. 
 
 == People == 
 The Mycenaeans of Greece had learned many things from other lands. By 1400 B.C., they were known for their [[art]], [[literature]], and [[philosophy]]. < ref name= " lifepac " > {{cite book|url=|title=History and geography 603 The civilizations of Greece and Rome|last=Hofflund, M.A.|first=Ethel|date=|publisher=Alpha Omega Publications, Inc|location=Rock Rapids|pages=|doi=|id=|authorlink=}} < /ref >  Their most important city, Mycenae (mi see' née), was just north of what later became Corinth. 
 
 In 1300 BC the king built a wall 23 [[feet|ft]] wide and 60 [[feet|ft]] high. < ref name=lifepac/ >  The stone blocks used were very big.  A ''[[corbel]] arch'', where each stone hung a little further beyond the one below, was used. A triangle was also used to support it. The Lion Gate, the main gate of the wall and an example of a corbel arch, is still admired today. < ref name=lifepac/ > 
 
 The common people went inside the palace walls in times of danger but at other times lived in their own houses. < ref name=lifepac/ >  Their houses were shaped like deep rectangles with flat roofs and front porches. < ref name=lifepac/ >  People worked at many different jobs. They were [[cook]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], [[carpenter]]s, [[tailor]]s, [[woodcutter]]s, and makers of [[textile]]s. The Mycenaeans grew many things and kept animals like [[oxen]], [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, and [[goat]]s. They also built good roads and bridges. Their army was strong. [[Spear]]s and [[wikt:javelin|javelins]] have been found, and also many [[sword]]s, big and small. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/NAMAMycenaeanBronze01.html |title=Mycenaean swords |access-date=2010-03-12 |archive-date=2014-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003110018/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/NAMAMycenaeanBronze01.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.larp.com/hoplite/JP5.jpg Mycenaean Type G sword (Horn Sword)] < /ref >  Their edge and point were used. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://home.att.net/~a.a.major/shielddag.jpg |title=Mycenaean dagger |access-date=2010-03-12 |archive-date=2010-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220183147/http://home.att.net/~a.a.major/shielddag.jpg |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Decline and collapse == 
 By 1200 BC the power of Mycenae was declining. The eventual destruction of Mycenae was part of the general [[Bronze Age collapse]] in the Greek mainland and beyond. Within a short period  all the palaces of southern Greece were burnt, including that at Mycenae. The cause or causes of the Bronze Age collapse are not known for sure. 
 
 == Religion == 
 For their worship of gods, these people made [[shrine|shrines]]. < ref name=lifepac/ >  [[Poseidon]] was worshiped as a chief deity, and the “protector of the sky” was [[Zeus]]. They also worshipped [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Hera]] and many others of the Greek religion. < ref name=lifepac/ >
