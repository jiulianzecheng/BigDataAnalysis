 '''''Clidastes''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[mosasaur]] from [[Marine biology|marine]] environments of the late [[Cretaceous]]. < ref > Cope E.D. 1869. On the reptilian orders, Pythonomorpha and Streptosauria. ''Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History'' '''12''': 250–266. < /ref >  It was an agile and fast swimmer which cruised the surface or shallow waters hunting for prey. 
 
 ''Clidastes'' was one of the smallest of the mosasaurs, averaging {{convert|2|–|4|m|ft|sp=us}} in length, with the largest specimens reaching {{convert|6.2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long.  
 It had a delicate, slim form with an expansion near the tip of the tail. This enabled it to chase down the fastest of prey.
