In [[ecology]], a '''biome''' is a major regional group of distinctive [[plant]] and [[animal]] 
 [[community|communities]] best adapted to the region's physical [[natural environment]], 
 [[latitude]], [[elevation]], and [[topography|terrain]]. 
 
 A biome is made up of [[ecoregion]]s or settlements at stable steady state and all associated transitional, disturbed, or degraded, [[vegetation]], [[fauna]] and [[soil]]s, but can often be identified by the [[climax vegetation]] type. 
 
 The [[biodiversity]] characteristic of each biome, especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant [[plant]] forms, is a function of [[abiotic]] factors and the [[biomass]] productivity of the dominant [[vegetation]]. Terrestrial biomes with higher [[net primary productivity]], [[Ecohydrology|moisture availability]], and [[temperature]]. 
 
 A fundamental classification of biomes is into: 
 
 # Terrestrial (land) biomes and 
 # Aquatic (water) biomes. 
 
 Biomes are often given local names. For example, a temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as ''[[steppe]]'' in central [[Asia]], ''[[savanna]]'' or [[Field|''field'']] in southern [[Africa]], ''[[prairie]]'' in [[North America]], ''[[pampa]]'' in [[South America]] and ''[[outback]]'' or ''[[scrubland|scrub]]'' in [[Australia]]. 
 Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection, especially under an individual nation's ''Biodiversity Action Plan''. 
 
 ==Terrestrial biomes== 
 Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes. Among the important climatic factors are: 
 * [[latitude]]: [[arctic]], [[boreal]], [[temperate]], [[subtropical]], [[tropical]]. 
 * [[humidity]]: [[humid]], semi-humid, semi-arid, and [[arid]]. 
 ** seasonal variation: rainfall may be distributed evenly throughout the year, or be marked by seasonal variations. 
 ** dry summer, wet winter: most regions of the earth receive most of their rainfall during the summer months; Mediterranean climate regions receive their rainfall during the winter months. 
 * [[elevation]]: increasing elevation causes a distribution of habitat types similar to that of increasing latitude. 
 
 [[Biodiversity]] generally increases away from the poles towards the [[equator]], and increases with humidity. 
 
 The most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to [[latitude]] (or temperature zoning) and humidity. 
 
 ===Udvardy system=== 
 In 1975, [[Miklos Udvardy]] published a system of [[biogeographic provinces]] that were divided into 12 terrestrial biomes. 
 
 ===Bailey system=== 
 Robert G. Bailey developed a biogeographical classification system for the United States in a map published in 1975. Bailey subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989. The Bailey system is based on climate, and is divided into four domains (Polar, Humid Temperate, Dry, and Humid Tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical, marine and continental, lowland and mountain). 
 
 ===WWF system=== 
 A team of biologists developed an ecological land classification system for the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) that identified 14 biomes, called '''major habitat types''', and further divided the world's land area into 867 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. This classification is used to define the [[Global 200]] list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by the (WWF) as priorities for conservation. The WWF major habitat types are as follows: 
 #Forests ('broadleaf' = [[Angiosperm]] [[tree]]s) 
 ## Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (tropical and subtropical, humid) 
 ## Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests (tropical and subtropical, semihumid) 
 ## Tropical and subtropical [[conifer]]ous forests (tropical and subtropical, semihumid) 
 ## Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests (temperate, humid) 
 ## Temperate coniferous forests (temperate, humid to semihumid) 
 ## [[Taiga|Boreal forests/taiga]] (subarctic, humid) 
 ## [[Mediterranean]] forests, woodlands, and [[scrub]] or sclerophyll forests (temperate warm, semihumid to semiarid with winter rainfall) 
 #Grasslands 
 ## Tropical and subtropical [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, and [[shrub]]lands (tropical and subtropical, semiarid) 
 ## Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands (temperate, semiarid) 
 ## Flooded grasslands and savannas (temperate to tropical, fresh or brackish water inundated) 
 ## Montane grasslands and shrublands: [[alpine biome|alpine]] (above the tree line) or montane (below the tree line, and hence with trees). 
 # [[Tundra]] (Arctic) 
 # [[Desert]]s and xeric shrublands (temperate to tropical, arid) 
 # [[Mangrove]] (subtropical and tropical, salt water inundated) 
 
 ==Aquatic biomes== 
 * [[continental shelf]] 
 * [[Littoral zone|littoral]]/[[intertidal zone]] 
 * [[River|riparian]] 
 * [[pond]] 
 * [[coral reef]] 
 * [[Ecosystem]] 
 * [[Habitat]] 
 * [[kelp forest]] 
 * [[pack ice]] 
 * [[hydrothermal vent]]s 
 * [[cold seep]]s 
 * [[Benthos|benthic zone]] 
 * [[pelagic zone]] 
 * [[nectos|neritic zone]] 
 
 ==Other biomes== 
 The [[Endolith]]ic biome, consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock [[porosity|pore]]s (small holes in rocks) and cracks, [[kilometer]]s beneath the surface, has only recently been discovered and does not fit well into most classification schemes.
