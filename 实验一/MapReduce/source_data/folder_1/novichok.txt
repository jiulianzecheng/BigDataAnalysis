There are 3â€“5 different substances, all called Novichok. The exact formula of these agents is unknown. The following facts are known or likely:

 In 2018, former Russian spy [[Sergei Skripal]] and his daughter were poisoned using Novichok. Novichok was also the agent in the [[2018 Amesbury poisonings]]. It is likely that [[Alexei Navalny]] was poisoned using Novichok in 2020.
