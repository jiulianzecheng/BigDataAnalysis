 '''Analysis''' is the process of breaking a [[complexity|complex topic]] or substance into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] since before [[Aristotle]] (384–322 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]), though ''analysis'' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Analysis|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Michael Beaney|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Michael Beaney|year=2012}} < /ref > 
 
 The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἀνάλυσις (''analusis'',  " a breaking up " , from ''ana-''  " up, throughout "  and ''lysis''  " a loosening " ). < ref > {{cite web|title=analysis (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=analysis|work=Online etymological dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Douglas Harper|year=2012}} < /ref > 
 
 In this context, Analysis is the [[opposite]] of [[synthesis]], which is to bring ideas together. 
 
 The following concepts are closely related to this basic idea: 
 * [[Mathematical analysis]] is the name given to any branch of [[mathematics]] that looks at what [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] are, how they behave, and what things can be done with them. 
 * [[Analytical chemistry]] looks at the qualities of [[substance]]s, and their composition.
