 '''Asparagus''' is a large [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s with over 300 different [[species]]. Some of the plants are grown as [[ornamental plant]]s. One of these is the  " asparagus fern " , ''[[A. setaceus|Asparagus setaceus]]'', which is not a real [[fern]]. The best known plant in this group is ''[[A. officinalis|Asparagus officinalis]]'', which is grown as a [[vegetable]], and is usually eaten in spring. 
 
 Asparagus was one of the plants which [[Carl von Linn√©]] showed in his work ''Species Plantarum''. ''A. officinalis'' is used as its [[type species]]. 
 
 Some species of asparagus are used in cooking. They are known to make [[urine]] smellier. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|title=Why Asparagus Makes Your Urine Smell|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-asparagus-makes-your-urine-smell-49961252/|access-date=2021-08-12|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en}} < /ref >
