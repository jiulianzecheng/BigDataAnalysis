 '''Pitchblende''' is a [[radioactive]], uranium-rich [[mineral]] and [[ore]]. It has a [[chemical composition]] that is largely [[uranium dioxide|UO < sub > 2 < /sub > ]], but also contains [[uranium trioxide|UO < sub > 3 < /sub > ]] and [[oxide]]s of [[lead]], [[thorium]], and [[rare earth elements]]. It is known as pitchblende due to its black color and high [[density]]. It is also commonly referred to as '''Uraninite'''.   
 
 The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the [[Ore Mountains]], on the [[Germany|German]]/[[Czech Republic|Czech]] border.  Pitchblende found in [[Germany]] was used by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth|M. Klaproth]] in 1789 to discover the element [[uranium]]. < ref name= " radiz " > {{Cite journal

 Pitchblende contains a small amount of [[radium]] as a [[radioactive decay]] product of uranium. Because the uranium isotopes  < sup > 238 < /sup > U and [[Uranium-235| < sup > 235 < /sup > U]] will decay to form the [[lead]] [[isotope]]s  < sup > 206 < /sup > Pb and  < sup > 207 < /sup > Pb, pitchblende also always has small amounts of lead. Small amounts of [[helium]] are also present in pitchblend as a result of [[alpha decay]].  
 
 Helium was first found on Earth in pitchblende after having been discovered  in the [[Sun]]'s atmosphere.

 Pitchblende is a major [[ore]] of [[uranium]].  
 
 Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (the initial source for the [[Manhattan Project]]) and in the [[Athabasca Basin]] in northern [[Canada]].   
 
 Another important source of pitchblende is at [[Great Bear Lake]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]], where it is found in large quantities associated with [[silver]]. It also occurs in [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[England]], and [[South Africa]]. In the [[United States]] it can be found in the states of [[New Hampshire]], [[Connecticut]], [[North Carolina]], [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]]. 
 
 Uranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into [[yellowcake]], which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.
