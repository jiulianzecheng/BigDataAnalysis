 The '''raccoon''' (''Procyon lotor'', '''common raccoon''',) is a [[mammal]]. Raccoons are curious, clever, and solitary. They are originally from [[North America]]. They have spread through [[Central America]], and live in various [[habitat]]s. They have escaped in some parts of [[Eurasia]] (see map), and now live there as well. Raccoons are in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Caniformia]], and are related to the [[mustelidae|mustelids]]. 
 
 The raccoon has short legs, a pointed nose, small ears, grayish-brown fur, and a bushy tail. 
 
 The raccoon's most distinctive features are its multi-purpose front [[paw]]s, its facial '[[mask]]', and its striped tail. Moreover, raccoons are noted for their [[intelligence]]. Studies show they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years. < ref name=Hoh > Hohmann, Ulf; Bartussek, Ingo  &  Böer, Bernhard 2001. ''Der Waschbär''. Reutlingen, Germany: Oertel+Spörer, pp. 71–72. {{ISBN|978-3-88627-301-0}} < /ref >  Raccoons are usually [[nocturnal]]. Their food is about 40% [[invertebrate]]s, 33% [[plant]] foods, and 27% [[vertebrate]]s. Raccoons are [[omnivore]]s. < ref > MacClintock, Dorcas 1981. ''A natural history of raccoons''. Caldwell, New Jersey: The Blackburn Press. {{ISBN|978-1-930665-67-5}} < /ref >   They feed on [[Mouse|mice]], [[squirrel]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], [[frog]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[Snake|snakes]], [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], [[insect]]s, [[worm]]s, [[fruit]], and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Their predators are [[red fox]]es, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[coyote]]s, [[bear]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[Hawk|hawks]], [[owl]]s, [[Puma|cougars]], and [[lynx|lynxes]]. 
 
 Most raccoons live in the wild. Being around [[human]]s does not bother them. They often [[nest]] in empty [[building]]s, [[garage]]s, [[shed]]s, and even the [[attic]]s of [[house]]s. Raccoons do not [[hibernate]] in the [[winter]]. Those that live further [[north]] where it is colder, grow thick [[coat]]s to keep them [[warm]] and spend long periods sleeping. Raccoons that live in captivity can survive up to 20 years. In the wild, they usually live only 1–3 years. 
 
 Two other species of raccoon, the crab-eating raccoon (''P. cancrivorus'') and the Cozumel Island raccoon (''P. pygmaeus''), are extremely similar to the common raccoon. The crab-eating raccoon is quite widespread in eastern [[South America]]. 
 
 After a [[gestation]] period (pregnancy) of about 65 days, two to five young are born in spring. Newborn raccoons are called  " kits " .
