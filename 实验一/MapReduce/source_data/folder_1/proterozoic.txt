 The '''Proterozoic''' [[eon]] comes before the [[Phanerozoic]]. It was a period before the first abundant complex life on [[Earth]]. The name Proterozoic comes from the Greek  " earlier life " . The Proterozoic Eon extended from 2500 million years ago (mya) to 541 mya. It is the most recent part of the former [[Precambrian]]. 
 
 The Proterozoic consists of 3 geologic [[era]]s, from oldest to youngest: 
 * [[Palaeoproterozoic]]: 2500 to 1600 million years ago 
 * [[Mesoproterozoic]]: 1600 to 1000 mya 
 * [[Neoproterozoic]]: 1000 to 542 mya 
 
 The well-identified events were: 
 *Several [[glacier|glaciations]], including the [[Snowball Earth]] during the [[Cryogenian]] period in the late Neoproterozoic. 
 *Rapid [[Crust (geology)|crustal]] segments collect into [[continent]]s. [[Supercontinent]]s '''[[Laurentia]]''' (Palaeoproterozoic) and '''[[Rodinia]]''' (Neoproterozoic) form. 
 *Early [[plate tectonics]]. 
 *[[Oxygen]]ation of the [[atmosphere]], the [[Great Oxygenation Event]]. 
 *Clean (unchanged by [[metamorphosis]]) [[sand]] and [[carbonate]] deposits occur for the first time.
