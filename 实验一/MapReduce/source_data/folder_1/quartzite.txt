 '''Quartzite''' is a hard [[metamorphic rock]]. < ref name= " MII " > {{cite web|url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photoquartzite.html|title=Quartzite|last=Powell|first=Darryl|publisher=Mineral Information Institute|accessdate=2009-09-09|archive-date=2009-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302072709/http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photoquartzite.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It is formed when [[sandstone]] is squeezed and heated under a chain of [[mountain]]s. 
 
 Although pure quartzite is white, it usually occurs in shades of pink and red. This happens when it contains some [[iron oxide]] (Fe < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 3 < /sub > ). Other colours, such as yellow and orange, are due to other [[mineral]] impurities. 
 
 When sandstone is changed to quartzite, the individual [[quartz]] grains and cement material [[Crystallization|recrystallizes]].  Most of the original [[texture]] of the sandstone is destroyed by the [[metamorphism]]. Minor amounts of cementing materials, iron oxide, [[silica]], [[carbonate]] and [[clay]], often move when this is happening. It causes streaks and [[lens]] shapes to form in the quartzite.
