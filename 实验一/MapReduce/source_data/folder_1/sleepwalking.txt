 '''Sleepwalking''', or '''somnambulism''', is a [[disorder]] belonging to the [[parasomnia]] family of sleeping problems. < ref > Barlow, David H. and V. Mark Durand 2008. ''Abnormal psychology: an integrative approach''. Cengage Learning, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-495-09556-7}} < /ref > 
 
 People with this disorder leave bed, without waking up, and walk around. In certain cases, people do things they also do in everyday life. According to research done, sleepwalking seems to be a problem related to the mechanism of waking up. 
 
 == What people do while sleepwalking == 
 The activities can be as simple as sitting up in bed, walking to the bathroom, and cleaning. Sometimes they are dangerous; examples include  cooking, driving, extremely violent gesture or grabbing at [[hallucination|hallucinated]] objects, < ref name= " Sleep Disorders Sourcebook " > Swanson, Jenifer, ed.

 Generally, sleepwalking cases consist of simple, repeated behaviours; occasionally there are reports of people performing complex behaviours while asleep, but the legitimacy of these claims is often disputed. < ref name= " sex " > {{cite news

 == Is sleepwalking common? == 
 There is no data about how common sleepwalking is. Estimates say that one to two percent of adults are sleepwalkers. Sleepwalking seems to be more common in children, between ten and thirty percent of children are affected; in most cases, they stop sleepwalking during [[puberty]]. Most cases of sleepwalking are temporary, they occur once, or only a few times. It looks like some sleepwalking may be inherited; very often, people who are sleepwalkers have other sleepwalkers in the family. 
 
 == Treatment == 
 Because people can hurt themselves while sleepwalking, it is a good idea to either wake a sleepwalker, or to guide the person back to bed. There are drugs that can be given to treat the condition. As there is no therapy, many experts are against the use of drugs. 
 
 However, sleepwalking is usually harmless and there's no need to treat it with drugs. If you experience sleepwalking, your friend will help you go to bed. 
 
 == In culture == 
 
 * [[La sonnambula|La Sonnambula]], Italian [[opera]] by [[Vincenzo Bellini]] 
 * Lucy Westenra, a fictional character in [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]],'' is sleepwalker
