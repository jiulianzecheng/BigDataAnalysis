A '''gramogram''' is a type of [[rebus]] in which a [[letter]] or a string of letters is used to make words because the names of the letters sound like the word they represent. An example of this is writing  " See you "  as  " CU " , since the names of the letters for the gramogram sound like the words of the phrase.
