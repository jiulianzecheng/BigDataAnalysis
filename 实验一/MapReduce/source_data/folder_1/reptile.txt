 '''Reptile''' is the common name for one of the main groups of land [[vertebrate]]s. It is not used so much by biologists, who use more accurate terms. 
 
 The name  " reptile "  comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] and means  " one who creeps " . All living reptile species are [[cold blooded]], have scaly [[skin]], and lay [[cleidoic egg]]s. < ref > Some give birth to live young, with the cleidoic eggs developing internally. < /ref > < ref > 2008.  " Squamata Suborder: Serpentes " . The University of Georgia Museum of Natural History. [http://dromus.nhm.uga.edu/~gmnh/gawildlife/index.php?page=speciespages/order_description & order=Squamata%20Suborder:%20Serpentes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613011828/http://dromus.nhm.uga.edu/~GMNH/gawildlife/index.php?page=speciespages%2Forder_description & order=Squamata%20Suborder%3A%20Serpentes|date=2010-06-13}} < /ref >  They excrete [[uric acid]] (instead of [[urea]]), and have a [[cloaca]]. A cloaca is a shared opening for the [[anus]], urinary tract and reproductive ducts. Reptiles also share an arrangement of the [[heart]] and major blood vessels which is different from that of mammals. < ref > Goodrich E.S. 1930. ''Studies on the structure and development of vertebrates''. Macmillan, London. < /ref >  Birds have all of these features. 
 
 Many important groups of reptiles are now [[extinct]], for example the [[mosasaur]]s. We used to say the [[dinosaur]]s were extinct, but they survive in the form of their feathered descendants ([[bird]]s). Ancient reptiles that do survive include the [[turtle]]s, the [[crocodile]]s and the [[Tuatara]], the lone survivor of its group. The great majority of present-day reptiles are [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s. 
 
 The study of living reptiles is called ''[[herpetology]]''. 
 
 ==Birds in relation to reptiles== 
 Some reptiles are more closely related to [[bird]]s than they are to other reptiles. Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards. [[Theropod]] [[dinosaurs]] are even more closely related, because birds evolved from them. 
 
 [[Cladistic]] writers prefer to put the birds (over 10,000 species) with what people usually call reptiles. < ref name=Early/ > < ref name=LR95 > {{Cite journal|year=1995 |title=A reevaluation of early amniote phylogeny |journal= Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=165–223 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1995.tb00932.x |url=http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3reisz/pdf/laurin_reisz1995.pdf|last1=Laurin |first1=Michel |last2=Reisz |first2=Robert R. }} < /ref > < ref name=MSP99 > {{cite journal |last=Modesto |first=S.P. |year=1999 |title=Observations of the structure of the Early Permian reptile ''Stereosternum tumidum'' Cope |journal=Palaeontologia Africana |volume=35 |pages=7–19}} < /ref >  (see [[Sauropsida]]) 
 
 ==Taxonomy== 
 Reptilia is an [[evolutionary grade]] rather than a [[clade]]. The main reason is that the term 'reptile' does not include birds, the descendents of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. Another reason is that the word 'reptile' is misleading because many extinct types were very different from living reptiles. 
 
 So instead of Reptilia as a taxonomic class, today many experts use Class [[Sauropsid]]a (which includes all reptiles and birds, living and extinct). Class [[Synapsid]]a includes mammals and all their forebears. ''Reptile'' is still the usual [[wikt:informal|informal]] term to describe living [[snakes]] and [[lizards]]. Mammals are a genuine clade, and so Mammalia is still the taxonomic term. 
 
 Since reptiles are not [[monophyletic]], reclassifying them is one of the key aims of researchers. < ref name=Early > Gauthier J.A., Kluge A.G  &  Rowe T. 1988.

The two groups split in the [[Carboniferous]], from stem-group [[Amniote]]s (the early [[tetrapod]]s, which laid [[cleidoic egg]]s). 
 
 ==Eye feature== 
 A [[membrane]] forms an inner [[eyelid]] in reptiles and birds. Whitish or translucent, it can be drawn across the eye to protect it from dust and keep it moist. It is called the ''nictitating membrane''. 
 
 == Size == 
 Reptiles can live in large and small sizes. Their land sizes can be both bigger and smaller than mammals. [[Titanosaur]]s were the largest land reptiles, and the smallest land reptile is a [[chameleon]] 13.5mm long. < ref > 'Smallest reptile on earth' discovered in Madagascar. ''BBC News'' [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55945948]. < /ref >
