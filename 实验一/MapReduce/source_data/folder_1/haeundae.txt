 The ''Haeundae Beach'' is at the southeast end of the city of [[Busan]] which is in [[South Korea]]. Along the 12 km of coastline is Busan's most popular [[beach]], and one of the most famous beaches in South Korea.  " Haeundae "  was so named by scholar Choi Chi-Won (857~?) of the Silla Dynasty (BC 57~AD 935). When he was walking past Dongbaekdo Island, he was fascinated by it and carved the words  " Hae Un Dae "  on a [[stone]] wall on the [[island]]. Haeundae is 1.5 km long, 30~50m wide, and spans an area of 58,400㎡. The [[white]] [[sand]] is [[wikt:rough|rough]] and is rather sticky. The sand of this beach is composed of sand that comes from Chuncheon Stream and [[Animal shell|shells]] that have been naturally eroded by the wind over time.  
 
 Haeundae used to be isolated from the large communities in Busan and Busanjin. However [[hotel]]s, shopping centers and other [[tourist]] facilities have been constructed on the beach front area since the mid-1990s, and Haendae is now an rich beach front area. Haeundae New Town, a major commercial and residential redevelopment project begun in 1990 and another development project, Centum City, has been ongoing since early 2000 and is now a major feature of Busan. In Centum City there is the world's largest department [[Shop|store]], Shinsegae Department Store and BEXCO (Busan Exhibition and Convention Center) has become a popular venue for international conventions and exhibitions. Nearby Marine City is built on land reclaimed from the [[sea]], and has several huge, high-rise apartment blocks.  
 
 Haeundae's geographical assets, along with its tourist facilities, have led to a regular role as one of the host venues for the annual [[Pusan International Film Festival]] (PIFF).  The [[2005 APEC Conference]] was held on Haeundae's Dongbeak Island. Haeundae is one of the most popular spots in Busan to view the first [[sunrise]] of the year on [[January]] 1. Also, one of the most famous beach events happens in the first week of January when the temperature is around 0°C, the  " Polar Bear Club " , held by Choseon Beach Hotel since 1988.  
 
 Dongbaek Island, at the south end of the beach, has a view of the sea by [[car]] and its coastline is famous for [[fish]]ing. Oryuk Islets, a symbol of Busan to many Koreans, can be seen in the distance from Dongbaek Island. During the hot [[summer]] months, Haeundae beach becomes very crowded with thousands of people and [[parasol]]s. People visit the beach from all over South Korea, as well as outside of Korea.
