A '''sliotar''' (or '''sliothar''') is a hard solid [[sphere]] slightly larger than a tennis ball, consisting of a [[cork (material)|cork]] core covered by two pieces of leather stitched together. Sometimes called a  " puck "  or  " hurling ball " , it resembles an American [[baseball]] with more pronounced stitching.  It is used in the Gaelic games of [[hurling]], [[camogie]], [[rounders]] and [[shinty]]. 
 
 Early sliotars used various materials, depending on the part of the country: 
 
 * hollow [[bronze]] 
 * wood and leather 
 * wood, rope and animal hair.
