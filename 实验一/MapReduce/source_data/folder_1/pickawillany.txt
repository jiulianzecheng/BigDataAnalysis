 '''Pickawillany''' (also spelled '''Pickawillamy''', '''Pickawillani''', or '''Picqualinni''') was a Miami Indian Village in the 18th century. It was along the [[Great Miami River]] in the [[Ohio Valley]]. An English trading site was close to the village. Both British and French wanted the land in the Ohio Country. The Miami people stopped relations with French fur traders. The Miami Chief [[Memeskia|La Demoiselle]] sided with the British. [[Céloron de Blainville]] visited the town to convince La Demoiselle to be allies with the French. Pickawillany became one of the largest Native American communities east of the Mississippi River. The French raided the town several times. The French fur trader [[Charles Michel de Langlade|Charles Langlade]] led Native tribes against Pickawillany in 1752 and destroyed the town. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Pickawillany - Ohio History Central|url=https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Pickawillany|access-date=2022-08-06|website=ohiohistorycentral.org}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=David J.|date=2014-12-01|title=On the Origins of  " Pickawillany " |url=https://ans-names.pitt.edu/ans/article/view/2024|journal=Names|language=en|volume=62|issue=4|pages=214–217|doi=10.1179/0027773814Z.00000000090|s2cid=162315944 |issn=1756-2279}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Lucido|first=Aimee|title=Raid On Pickawillany|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1752/6/21/raid-on-pickawillany|access-date=August 6, 2022|website=World History Project|archive-date=September 27, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220927111908/https://worldhistoryproject.org/1752/6/21/raid-on-pickawillany|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
