'''Punishment''' is when something is done to a [[person]] (or [[animal]]) that they do not like. It may be because they broke a [[rule]]. There are many kinds of punishment, from a [[death penalty]] for very bad [[crime]]s, to things that [[parent]]s  may do to punish [[child]]ren, like spanking them or taking away their toys. People are often sent to [[prison]] as punishment for a crime. 
 
 Punishment can be seen as good in [[society]] to prevent people from doing bad things. It can also be seen as cruel and unnecessary. It can also be seen to do more harm than good.
