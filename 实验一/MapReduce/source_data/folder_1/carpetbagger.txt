 '''Carpetbagger''' is a term from the [[United States]] political history. A carpetbagger was a northerner  who moved to the South after the [[American Civil War]]. This period is called the  " reconstruction era " .  
 
 White southerners feared they would [[loot]] the defeated South. < ref > Davidson ''et al'' 2002. ''Nation of Nations: a concise narrative of the American republic''. 3rd ed, New York: McGraw Hill. < /ref >  Sixty carpetbaggers were elected to [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. Among them were most [[Republican]] [[governor]]s in the South during reconstruction. A historian said: 
 {{quote|Carpetbaggers generally supported measures aimed at democratizing and modernizing the South â€“ civil rights legislation, aid to economic development, the establishment of public school systems. < ref > Foner, Eric 1988. ''Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution 1863-1877''. p 296. < /ref > }} 
 
 " Carpetbagger "  referred to the cheap [[carpet bag]]s (a form of [[luggage]]) which many of the newcomers carried. The term came to be associated with opportunism and exploitation by outsiders.  It is used today for a  " [[parachute candidate]] " : a political [[candidate]] for public office in an area far from home.
