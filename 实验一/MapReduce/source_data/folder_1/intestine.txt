 The '''intestines''', [[Division (mathematics)|divided]] into the [[small intestine]] and the [[large intestine]], of an [[animal]] are like a tube through which [[food]] and [[bile]] from the stomach move. 
 
 The first part of the small '''intestine''' is called the [[duodenum]], where most food is broken down by [[enzymes]]. Later, the small intestine [[Absorption|absorbs]] useful [[Chemical compound|compounds]] from the [[digestion|digested]] food, which is done using small [[villi]] or tiny [[microvillus|microvilli]]  < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec09/ch118/ch118d.html |title=Small intestine: biology of the digestive system: Merck Manual Home Edition |first= |last= |work=merckmanuals.com |year=2011 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |archive-date=24 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124003340/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec09/ch118/ch118d.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  - hair-like structures in the walls of the intestine.
