 ==How it worked== 
 The Sobig worm is a large emailing worm that sent itself to any [[email address]]es with [[file extension]]s like .dbx, .eml, .hlp, .htm, .html, .mht, .wab, and .txt. The worm often used an email that includes  " Re: "  to seem as if people were being replied to from someone. The user would then open the email and click on the [[attachment]], running the worm and [[download]]ing it on to their [[computer]]. < ref name= " Symantec " / >
