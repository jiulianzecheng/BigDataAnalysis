 The '''eurypterids''', related to [[arachnid]]s, were the largest known [[arthropod]]s. They are members of the extinct [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Eurypterida'''. It is a most diverse [[Chelicerata|Chelicerate]] order. < ref name='dunlop2008' > {{Cite journal| issn = 0161-8202| volume = 36| issue = 2| pages = 267–272| last = Dunlop| first = J.A. |display-authors = etal | title = How many species of fossil arachnids are there?| journal = Journal of Arachnology| year = 2008| doi = 10.1636/CH07-89.1| s2cid = 42371883| url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/229074}} < /ref > 
 
 The largest, such as '' < u > [[Jaekelopterus]] < /u > '', reached 2½ metres in length, but most species were less than 20 cm (8 inches). They were the largest [[arthropod]]s of all time. They were [[predator]]s which thrived in the warm, shallow seas and lakes of the [[Ordovician]] to the [[Permian]] periods, around 460 to 248 million years ago. Recent research suggsts their eyesight was not very good. < ref > Anderson R.P. ''et al'' 2014. What big eyes you have: the ecological role of giant pterygotid eurypterids.

 The move from the sea to fresh water probably occurred by the [[Pennsylvanian]] period. Eurypterids went extinct during the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] 251 million years ago, and their fossils have a near global distribution. 
 
 The typical eurypterid had a large, flat, semicircular [[carapace]], followed by a jointed section, and finally a tapering, flexible tail, most ending with a long spine at the end (''Pterygotus'', though, had a large flat tail, possibly with a smaller spine). Behind the head of the eurypterids were twelve body segments. These segments are formed by a dorsal plate, called a tergite, and a ventral plate, called a sternite. The tail, known as the [[telson]], is spiked in most eurypterids. < ref > {{cite book |author=L.
