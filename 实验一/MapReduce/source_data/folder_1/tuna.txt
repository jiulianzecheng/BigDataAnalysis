 '''Tuna''', sometimes called '''tuna fish''', are several [[species]] (kinds) of [[fish]]. They are in the family '''[[Scombridae]]''', mostly in the genus '''''Thunnus'''''. 
 
 Tuna are fast swimmers. People have seen tuna swim at up to 77 & nbsp;km/h. Several species of tuna are [[warm-blooded]]. Most species of fish have white flesh. The flesh of the tuna is different. It is pink to dark red. This is because tuna muscle [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] contains greater quantities of [[myoglobin]]. Myoglobin is a [[molecule]] that binds [[oxygen]]. Some of the larger tuna species such as the [[Northern bluefin tuna]] can raise their blood temperature above the water temperature with muscular activity. This enables them to live in cooler waters and survive a wider range of circumstances. 
 
 ==Commercial== 
 Tuna is an important commercial fish. Some varieties of tuna, such as the [[bluefin tuna|bluefin]] and [[bigeye tuna]] are threatened by [[overfishing]], dramatically affecting tuna populations in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and northwestern [[Pacific Ocean]]s. Other populations seem to support fairly healthy fisheries (for example, the central and western Pacific [[skipjack tuna]]), but there is mounting evidence that overfishing threatens tuna fisheries worldwide. 
 
 Some fishermen in Australia now grow [[Southern bluefin tuna]] in fish farms. Fish farms are areas of water with nets around them, where farmers raise (keep and grow animals) fish. Some tuna farms are circular nets 40 meters in diameter and 20 meters deep. The fishermen catch the tuna at sea, and then they keep the tuna in these farms. The tuna grow and get fatter for three to six months. There are also tuna farms in the [[Mediterranean]], [[North America]], and [[Japan]] that raise [[Northern bluefin tuna]]. Some environmental groups say that tuna farms use too much fish as food for the tuna, and that the farms pollute the water (make the water dirty). 
 
 ==Diets== 
 Tuna are high up in the [[food chain]]. They eat animals that ate animals. Their diet leads to the accumulation of [[heavy metals]] in their flesh. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] levels can be relatively high in some of the larger species of tuna such as bluefin and [[albacore]]. As a result, in March 2004 the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued guidelines recommending pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children to limit their intake of tuna and other types of predatory fish [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/admehg3.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519060018/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/admehg3.html |date=2007-05-19 }}. However, most canned light tuna is [[skipjack tuna]] and is very low in mercury. 
 
 Sport fishermen like to catch tuna using [[rod]]s and [[hook]]s.
