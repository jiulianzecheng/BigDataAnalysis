 '''Polycythemia''' (also known as '''polycythaemia''' or '''polyglobulia''') is a rare [[blood]] disease in which there is an increase in [[red blood cells]]. This can cause blood to become thicker and therefore cause [[strokes]] and [[heart attack]]s. 
 
 Emergency treatment for this can include removal of blood. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Spivak|first=Jerry L.|date=July 2019|title=How I treat polycythemia vera|url=https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/134/4/341/260695/How-I-treat-polycythemia-vera|journal=Blood|language=en|volume=134|issue=4|pages=341â€“352|doi=10.1182/blood.2018834044|issn=0006-4971|pmid=31151982|doi-access=free}} < /ref >
