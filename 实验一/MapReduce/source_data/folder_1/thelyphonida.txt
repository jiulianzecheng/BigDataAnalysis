 '''Thelyphonida''' is an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[arachnid]]s commonly known as '''vinegarroons'''. 
 
 They give out a [[vinegar]]-like mist (containing mostly [[acetic acid]]). The Vinegarroon is not [[Venom (poison)|venomous]] and is not a true scorpion. It is related to [[spider]]s, [[Scorpion|true scorpions]], and [[tick]]s. They are also known as [[whip]] scorpions because they look like true scorpions and because of their whip like tails.
