[[Image:Wiki-Video-pineta eraclea.ogv|thumb|200px| Panorama of Eraclea's pinewood]]'''Eraclea''' is a town in the [[province of Venice]], [[Veneto]], [[Italy]]. SP42 goes through it. 
 Eraclea Mare is the [[Lido]] of Eraclea [http://www.eracleamare.travel/]. 
 
 It is located on the [[Adriatic Sea]] near the coast between the rivers Piave and Livenza and between two famous touristic towns: [[Caorle]] and [[Jesolo]]. 
 
 '''Eracleamare''', one of the destinations of summer tourism on the Adriatic riviera, is together with Jesolo and Caorle one of the best known seaside resort on the Venetian coast. Within the last year, a steady growth of foreign tourists, especially from Germany, has been recorded. Also in 2010, Eracleamare has received the  " Blu Flag "  from the [[FEE]] [http://www.eracleamare.travel/2010/05/16/eraclea-and-blue-flag-2010/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909084439/http://www.eracleamare.travel/2010/05/16/eraclea-and-blue-flag-2010/ |date=2011-09-09 }}. 
 
 ==Main sights== 
 Eraclea Mare is famous cause of its pinewood and  " Mort lagoon "  (in Italian: Laguna del Mort [http://www.eracleamare.travel/2010/05/15/the-mort-lagoon/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909114513/http://www.eracleamare.travel/2010/05/15/the-mort-lagoon/ |date=2011-09-09 }}). 
 
 The Mort Lagoon, an extremely evocative naturalistic site between Eraclea and Jesolo, was originated by the overflowing of the Piave river in 1936, whose bed was modified in its last stretch after a big flood. The Mort stretches between Eraclea Mare and the mouth of the Piave river and it is a sea-lagoon, being supplied with water only by the flood-tides. Still uncontaminated, the Mort is characterized by shallow and calm waters with a sandy and muddy seabed, rich in phytoplankton.
