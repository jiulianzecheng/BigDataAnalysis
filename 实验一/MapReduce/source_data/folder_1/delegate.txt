 == Political delegates == 
 Before a [[general election]] in the [[US]], the process to select [[candidate]]s begins with delegates. < ref name=gov101VS > {{cite web |url=https://votesmart.org/education/presidential-primary#.VsZUufkrLIU |title=Government 101: United States Presidential Primary |publisher=Project Vote Smart |access-date=18 February 2016}} < /ref >  At the [[US states|state]] level each of the major [[political party|political parties]] selects delegates to attend a [[United States presidential nominating convention|national convention]]. < ref name=gov101VS/ >  The two ways delegates are selected are the [[caucus]] and the [[Primary election]]. < ref name=gov101VS/ >  Each state may have different ways to select delegates as do [[political party|political parties]]. < ref name=gov101VS/ >  The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] lets each state decide how to select delegates. < ref name=gov101VS/ >  The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] uses a proportional method for awarding delegates. < ref name=gov101VS/ >  The percentage of delegates each candidate is awarded depends on the caucus or how many are elected for each candidate. Candidate  " X "  may have 40 [[percent]], candidate  " Y "  may have 20 percent while candidate  " Z "  may have 50 percent. Any remaining percent may be undecided votes or for other candidates.  
 
 A candidate becomes his or her party's presidential nominee after the delegates sent to the convention give that person a majority of the votes. < ref name=KlonskyWP > {{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/06/AR2008020602173.html |title=The Role of Delegates in the U.S. Presidential Nominating Process |author=Joanna Klonsky |date=6 February 2008 |publisher=The Washington Post |access-date=18 February 2016}} < /ref >  Because there are often multiple rounds of votes taken to select a presidential candidate, delegates sometimes change their votes. < ref name=KlonskyWP/ >  But in recent elections that has become unnecessary. Since 1976, it was fairly clear who was the [[front-runner]] even before the first vote was taken. < ref name=KlonskyWP/ >
