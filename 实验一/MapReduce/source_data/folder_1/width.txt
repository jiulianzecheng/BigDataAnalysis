'''Width''' or '''breadth''' is the side-to-side length, [[Measurement|measuring]] across the object at right angles to the height. 
 
 For example, the [[distance]] between the left side and right side of a [[chair]] is its width. 
 
 Objects have a [[length]] and a width in [[2D|two dimensions]] or more. In shapes such as [[rectangles]], [[Multiplication|multiplying]] the length and the width equals the [[area]] of the shape.
