 '''Rhinocerotoidea''' is a superfamily consisting of four families of odd-toed ungulates, three of which, the Amynodontidae, Hyracodontidae, and Paraceratheriidae, are extinct. 
 
 == Overview == 
 
 The only extant family is the Rhinocerotidae (true rhinoceroses), which survives as five living species. 
 
 Extinct non-rhinocerotid members of the group are sometimes considered rhinoceroses in a broad sense. 
 
 The family Paraceratheriidae contains the largest land mammals known to have ever existed.
