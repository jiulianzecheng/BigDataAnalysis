A '''system'''  is a group of related things that work together as a whole. These things can be [[real]] or [[imagination|imaginary]]. Systems can be man-made things like a car [[engine]] or natural things like a [[star system]]. Systems can also be [[concepts]] made by [[people]] to organize [[idea]]s.  
 
 A '''subsystem''' is a system that is part of some larger system. For example, in [[Computer network|computer networking]], a disk subsystem is a part of a computer system. 
 
 == Definition ==  
 *A system is a group of things that connect and form some kind of coherent whole. 
 
 One of the founders of [[physiology]], [[Claude Bernard]], took a big step when he noticed that the internal systems of the body tend to keep things the same even if they are disturbed. He called the functions which keep system stable as [[homeostasis]]. < ref > Cannon W.B. 1932. ''The wisdom of the body''.New York: Norton. < /ref >  This led towards the ideas of error-correction, [[feedback]] and regulation. These are all typical of systems which have some kind of goal and can adjust their behaviour so as to correct errors. 
 
 == Example == 
 The [[Solar System]] is an example of a system. The Solar System includes the [[Sun]] and the eight planets, as well as the moons of those planets. These and other members are linked by [[gravity]] and by their history as a  [[planetary system]]. 
 
 == Types of systems == 
 There are many kinds of systems. The key is that the elements of a system work together as a whole whilst still keeping their own identity. This is why planetary systems and body systems are good examples. They work together but have their own separate identity. 
 * Systems in a living person, such as [[digestive system]], [[nervous system]], and so on. These systems operate so as to keep the body's [[physiology]] going within limits. 
 * Systems of life, such as [[life cycle]], [[carbon cycle]], or [[ecosystem]] 
 * Systems in science, such as the  [[solar system]] 
 * Any mechanical or electrical gadgets where parts work together to keep the output within certain limits. A [[thermostat]] is the classic example of this.
