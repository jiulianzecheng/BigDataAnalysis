 '''Flounders''' are a group of [[flatfish]]. The term is used for a number of flatfish who only related by being in the suborder Pleuronectoidei: (families Achiropsettidae, Bothidae, Pleuronectidae, Paralichthyidae, and Samaridae). It is a  " form name " , which means they are not necessarily ''close'' relations, they just look alike. 
 
 Flounders live at the bottom of coastal lagoons and [[estuary|estuaries]] of the [[Northern Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. When flounder are hatched they have one eye on each side of its head. As they grow one eye moves until they have both eyes on the same side of the head. 
 
 Industrial [[overfishing]] has reduced the population to one-tenth of its original size, and the individuals left are smaller. They rarely have the time to grow to full size. < ref name= " Clover2008 " > {{cite book|first=Charles|last=Clover|title=The end of the line: how overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMY-gEKMod8C|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25505-0|oclc=67383509}} < /ref > < ref name= " Myers2003 " > {{Cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Worm | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1038/nature01610 | title = Rapid worldwide depletion of predatory fish communities | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6937 | pages = 280–283 | year = 2003 | pmid =  12748640| bibcode = 2003Natur.423..280M | s2cid = 2392394 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/nature-news/save-big-fish/|last=Dalton|first=Rex|date=2006|title=Save the big fish: targeting of larger fish makes populations prone to collapse |work=BioEd Online|access-date=26 March 2017|archive-date=27 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327165926/http://www.bioedonline.org/news/nature-news/save-big-fish/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature05232|pmid=17051218|title=Fishing elevates variability in the abundance of exploited species|journal=Nature|volume=443|issue=7113|pages=859–62|year=2006|last1=Hsieh|first1=Chih-hao|last2=Reiss|first2=Christian S.|last3=Hunter|first3=John R.|last4=Beddington|first4=John R.|last5=May|first5=Robert M.|last6=Sugihara|first6=George|bibcode=2006Natur.443..859H|s2cid=4398663}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Habitat== 
 Flounder feed at soft muddy areas of the sea bottom, near bridge piles, docks and coral reefs. They have been found at the bottom of the [[Mariana trench]], the deepest known ocean canyon. Swiss scientist [[Jacques Piccard]] and US Navy Lt. [[Don Walsh]] reached a depth of {{convert|10916|m|ft|sp=us}}.  They were surprised to discover flounder about 30 & nbsp;cm long. 
 
 A flounder's food is mainly fish spawn, [[crustacean]]s, [[polychaete]]s and small fish.  Flounder normally grow to a length of {{convert|12.5|-|37.5|cm|in|sp=us}}, and as large as {{convert|60|cm|in|sp=us}}. Their width is about half their length. 
 
 === Camouflage === 
 Flounders are highly camouflaged, often more so than these examples. But they are fished by bottom [[trawler|trawls]] which scrape them off the sea-bed into the net. 
 
 ==Taxonomy== 
 Flounder is a general term for many species.
