 '''Barrel''' is an old [[English language|English]] word for a big holder of [[liquid]]s, such as [[petrol]], [[beer]], [[wine]] or [[oil]]. Barrels are most commonly made of either [[wood]] or [[metal]] but many are [[plastic]] 
 
 Barrels are used to age [[wine]], and other [[beverage]]s such as [[whisky]] and [[beer]]. Most of those are made of [[oak]] wood. 
 
 A barrel is also used to [[measurement|measure]] liquids. One barrel of oil is 158.987 [[litre]]s (42 [[Gallon|US gallons]]). It is shortened as  " bbl " . This use may have come from the early [[Pennsylvania]]n oil fields where wooden barrels were used to store and move oil around. In 1866, the people of [[West Virginia]] started using it regularly. At this time, the amount was set to 42 American gallons. It was later world-wide for measuring amounts of oil and [[money|pricing]] it. Today, oil is rarely stored or [[Transportation|transported]] in actual barrels, but the term  " barrel "  is still used to mean a 42-gallon measurement. 
 
 A barrel can also be used to measure dry goods. For example, a barrel can mean 196 pounds (about 89 kilograms) of flour. 
 
 ==Different sizes== 
 The size of some standard barrels is not the same in all [[country|countries]]. Some countries have different sizes for different liquids. 
 *In the [[United Kingdom]], there is a standard barrel for beer. It is 36 [[Gallon|imperial gallon]]s (163.659 litres). 
 * In the [[United States]], a standard barrel for liquids is 31.5 US gallons (about 119.2 litres). For beer, the standard barrel is 31 US gallons (117.348 litres), because of [[tax]] [[laws]]. 
 * A physical metal barrel for oil or chemicals usually holds 55 US gallons (208.198 litres), but the word  " barrel "  used as a measurement refers to a 42-gallon measurement. 
 
 ==History== 
 The first people to start using barrels were the [[Celts]] about 350 BC. The Roman Empire started using barrels after trading with the Celts. Barrels remained popular for shipping items until the 20th century.
