 The word '''judgment''' (also spelled '''judgement''') means making a decision carefully, after studying and comparing all [[evidence]] that is available. A judgment may be about what is the best thing to do, or how to do it, or how to classify something or someone, or what to think about something.   
 
 Judgment may differ according to the topic: 
 
 * In [[law]] it is a decision made by a [[judge]], about whether a [[crime]] was committed and, if so, whether [[punishment]] should be given. 
 * In [[psychology]] it is a decision based on [[wisdom]]. It is about making sensible decisions. 
 * In [[religion]] it is about reward and punishment from  a [[deity|god]].  This is often called  " Divine Judgment " . 
 * The word can be used in the sense of  " [[opinion]] " :  " In my judgment.... "
