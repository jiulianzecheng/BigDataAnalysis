 A '''cheesesteak''' is a [[sandwich]] made in [[Philadelphia]].  It is made of a long [[hoagie roll]], cut in half and filled with thin slices of [[steak]] and covered with melted [[cheese]]. The cheese is either [[provolone]] or [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] in the form of whiz. Some cheesesteaks also have [[onion]]s or [[green pepper]]s.  [[Pat's King of Steaks]] and Geno's are two famous places in Philadelphia that make cheesesteaks. Pat's is thought to be the place that popularized the cheesesteak.
