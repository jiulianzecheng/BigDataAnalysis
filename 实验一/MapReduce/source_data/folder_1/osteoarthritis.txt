 '''Osteoarthritis''' normally affects older people: it is a [[disease]] where [[joint]]s wear out. As the joint surface wears away, it sheds particles which stimulate the joint lining to produce fluid. This causes the joint to [[inflammation|swell]]. When the joint ''[[cartilage]]'' wears away, the core of the bone becomes exposed. The exposed bone rubs against other exposed bone.  
 
 ==Symptoms== 
 
 Joints will be stiff and [[pain]]ful, and may be swollen. The pain may be worse after exercise. It may get harder to move the joint.
