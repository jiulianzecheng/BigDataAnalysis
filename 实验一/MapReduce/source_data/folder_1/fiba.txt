 The '''International Basketball Federation''' ('''FIBA''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə}} {{Respell|FEE|bə}}; [[French language|French]]: {{lang|fr|Fédération Internationale de Basketball}}) is the governing body of the sport of [[basketball]].  Originally known as the {{lang|fr|Fédération Internationale de Basketball Amateur}}, in 1989 it dropped the word ''[[amateur]]'' from its name but kept the [[acronym]]; the  " BA "  now represents the first two letters of ''basketball''. 
 
 FIBA defines the [[rules of basketball]] such what equipment and facilities to use, organises international competitions, regulates the transfer of [[Sportsperson|athletes]] across countries, and controls the appointment of international [[Official (basketball)|referees]]. A total of 213 national federations are now members, organized since 1989 into five zones: [[FIBA Africa|Africa]], [[FIBA Americas|Americas]], [[FIBA Asia|Asia]], [[FIBA Europe|Europe]], and [[FIBA Oceania|Oceania]]. 
 
 The [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]] is a world tournament for men's national teams held every four years. Teams compete for the [[Naismith Trophy]], named in honor of basketball's Canadian creator [[James Naismith]]. The tournament occurred in the same year as the [[FIFA World Cup]] from 1970 through 2014, but starting in [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019]], the Basketball World Cup will move to the year following the FIFA World Cup.
