 In science, '''structure''' is a fundamental [[concept]]. It means the arrangement of parts. Examples are the [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] in a body, or  [[crystals]] in a [[substance]] like [[granite]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://ardictionary.com/Structure/16906 |title=Accurate and Reliable Dictionary |access-date=2011-03-06 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707160139/http://ardictionary.com/Structure/16906 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
