 A '''hand''' is the part of the [[body]] at the end of an [[arm]]. Most [[human]]s have two hands. Each hand usually has four [[finger]]s and a [[thumb]]. On the inside of the hand is the palm. The five bones inside this part of the hand are called [[metacarpal]]s. The [[wrist]] connects the hand to the arm. The hand has 27 bones including the wrist bones. 
 
 When the fingers are all bent tightly, the hand forms a [[fist]]. The [[joint]]s that are the hardest part of the fist are called [[knuckle]]s. Many other animals, especially other [[primate]]s, have hands that can hold things. Human hands can do things other hands cannot.
