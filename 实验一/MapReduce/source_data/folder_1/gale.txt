[[Image:Beaufort scale 7.jpg|thumb|7 beaufort is the first level where the word gale is used]] 
 A '''gale''' is a very strong [[wind]]. The [[Beaufort scale]] is a way to measure [[weather]] conditions. It is based on [[observation]]s. The first level of the scale that uses the word gale is 7 beaufort (of a total of 13 steps). There are other definitions as well. The U.S. Government's [[National Weather Service]] defines a gale as 34 to 47 [[Knot (speed)|knots]] (63 & nbsp;km/h to 87 & nbsp;km/h or 39 miles per hour to 54 miles per hour) of sustained surface winds. < ref > [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/ National Weather Service Glossary], s.v. [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=Gale  " gale " ]. < /ref >  [[Weather forecast|Forecasters]] usually issue [[gale warning]]s when they think there will be winds of this strength. 
 
 Other sources use speeds as low as {{convert|28|kn|km/h}} and as high as {{convert|90|kn|km/h}}. The {{convert|90|kn|km/h|sing=on}} definition is rare. A common alternative definition of the maximum is {{convert|55|kn|km/h}}. < ref > [http://www.novalynx.com/glossary-g.html Glossary of Meteorological Terms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211180643/http://www.novalynx.com/glossary-g.html |date=2008-12-11 }}, NovaLynx Corporation. < /ref >
