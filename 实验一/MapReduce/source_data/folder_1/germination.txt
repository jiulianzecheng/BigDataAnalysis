 '''Germination''' occurs when a [[spore]] or [[seed]] starts to [[grow]]. It is a term used in [[botany]]. When a spore or seed '''germinates''', it produces a [[Plant stem|shoot]] or [[seedling]], or (in the case of [[fungi]]) a [[hypha]]. The [[biology]] of spores is different from seeds. 
 
 A ''spore'' germinates if and when conditions are right. It has a very limited lifespan. The method of spore-bearers, which are lower plants such as [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s and also fungi, is to produce vast numbers of spores, of which only a small percentage germinate. 
 
 ''Seeds'' contain an [[embryo]], a store of food (the [[endosperm]]), and a protective coat. Seed plants include [[Gymnosperm]]s (such as [[conifer]]s) and [[Angiosperm]]s (such as [[flowering plants]]). Seeds can survive much longer than spores, sometimes for hundreds of years. The strategy of seed-bearing plants is to invest energy and material in the substance of seeds, and they have evolved more sophisticated methods of dispersal than just wind. < ref name= " Fenner " > Fenner, Michael and Thompson, Ken 2005.

 Seeds do not germinate until their requirements are met, and these needs differ from [[species]] to species. < ref name= " Baskin, C.C 1998 " > Baskin C.C.  &  Baskin J.M. 1998. ''Seeds: ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination''. Academic Press, [[San Diego]]. < /ref > 
 :# The ''dormancy period'' must be over. Dormancy is governed by changes inside the seed. Each species has its own dormancy period, and will not germinate until that period is over. 
 :# Their ''hibernation'' must be over. The hibernation is ended when events in the environment trigger germination. Sometimes this is just temperature and water, sometimes fire, sometimes the seed must go through a long cold spell. 
 
 The requirements for [[fruit]]s is the same as for seeds. A fruit is just a seed with one or more extra layers derived from parts of the flower.
