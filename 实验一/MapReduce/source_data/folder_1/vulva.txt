 The '''vulva''' is the part of the body of [[female]] [[mammal]]s (including [[woman|women]]) where the outside parts of the reproductive system can be seen. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/vagvulv/index.htm|title=CDC - Vaginal and Vulvar Cancers|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-11}} < /ref >  The parts of the vulva that can be seen are the:

 The mons pubis is the area of skin and fat above the other structures. It protects the other structures below it. The labia majora are thick areas of skin and fat located to the side of the urinary and vaginal openings. Smaller and thinner labia are the labia minora. These structures are connected to the hood of the [[clitoris]] . They are close to the vagina. Many people call the [[vagina]] when they mean the vulva. The vagina is the ''tube'' connecting the internal parts (the [[womb]]) to the vulva. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.girlshealth.gov/body/reproductive/system.html|title=How the female reproductive system works {{!}} girlshealth.gov|website=www.girlshealth.gov|access-date=2018-08-13}} < /ref >
