 '''''Hatzegopteryx''''' ( " [[Hațeg]] basin wing " ) is a [[genus]] of [[Azhdarchidae|azhdarchid]] [[pterosaur]]. It was found in [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]]. It is known only from the [[Type (biology)|type species]], '''''Hatzegopteryx thambema''''', named in 2002 based on parts of the skull and [[humerus]]. < ref name= " buffetautetal2002 " > {{cite journal | last1 = Buffetaut | first1 = E. | last2 = Grigorescu | first2 = D. | last3 = Csiki | first3 = Z. | date = 2002 | title = A new giant pterosaur with a robust skull from the latest Cretaceous of Romania | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 180–184 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-002-0307-1| pmid = 12061403 | bibcode = 2002NW.....89..180B | s2cid = 15423666 | url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/16209/files/PAL_E3417.pdf }} < /ref >  Additional [[Fossil|fossils]], including a [[cervical vertebrae|neck vertebra]], were included later. The largest of these remains shows that the Hatzegopteryx was one of the biggest pterosaurs, with an estimated wingspan of {{convert|10|to|12|m}}. 
 
 It is unusual because it had a very wide skull with large muscular attachments. The bones had a soft internal texture instead of being hollow. it had a short, robust, and heavily muscled neck {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} long. This short neck was about half the length of other azhdarchids. The neck could withstand strong bending forces. ''Hatzegopteryx'' lived on Hațeg Island, an island in the [[Cretaceous]] subtropics within the prehistoric [[Tethys Sea]]. It was probably the [[apex predator]] of Hațeg Island, tackling larger prey (including dwarf [[titanosaur]]s and [[iguanodontia]]ns) than other azhdarchids.
