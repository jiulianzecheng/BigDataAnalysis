A '''chromosphere''' ( " sphere of color " ) is the second layer of a [[Stellar atmosphere|star's atmosphere]]. It is located above the [[photosphere]] and below the [[solar transition region]] and [[corona]]. The term usually refers to the [[Sun|Sun's]] chromosphere, but not only. 
 [[File:HI6563_fulldisk.jpg|right|thumb|The chromosphere gives off electromagnetic radiation in the ''H'' < sub > α < /sub >  spectral line, allowing for it to be viewed using special filters.]] 
 In the [[Solar atmosphere|Sun's atmosphere]], the chromosphere is about {{convert|3,000|to|5,000|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} in height, or a little more than 1% of the Sun's radius at maximum thickness. It possesses a homogeneous layer at the border with the photosphere. Hair-like jets of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], called [[Solar spicule|spicules]], rise from this homogeneous area and through the chromosphere, extending up to {{convert|10,000|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} into the corona above. 
 
 The chromosphere has a usual and expected red color due to [[Electromagnetic emission|electromagnetic emissions]] in the [[H-alpha|''H'' < sub > α < /sub > ]] [[spectral line]]. Information about the chromosphere is mostly received by analysis of its given-off electromagnetic radiation. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Jess|first1=D.B|last2=Morton|first2=RJ|last3=Verth|first3=G|last4=Fedun|first4=V|last5=Grant|first5=S.T.D|last6=Gigiozis|first6=I.|date=July 2015|title=Multiwavelength Studies of MHD Waves in the Solar Chromosphere.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=190|issue=1–4|pages=103–161|arxiv=1503.01769|bibcode=2015SSRv..190..103J|doi=10.1007/s11214-015-0141-3|s2cid=55909887}} < /ref >   
 
 Chromospheres have also been followed on [[Star|stars]] other than the Sun. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Chromosphere|url=http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/chromos.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404000148/http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/chromos.shtml|archive-date=2014-04-04|access-date=2014-04-28}} < /ref >  On large stars, chromospheres sometimes make up a significant proportion of the whole star. For example, the chromosphere of [[supergiant star]] [[Antares]] has been found to be about 2.5 times larger in thickness than the star's radius. < ref > {{cite web|title=Supergiant Atmosphere of Antares Revealed by Radio Telescopes|url=https://public.nrao.edu/news/supergiant-atmosphere-of-antares-revealed-by-radio-telescopes/|access-date=9 September 2022|website=National Radio Astronomy Observatory}} < /ref >
