A '''foundry''' is a place where molten ([[melt]]ed) [[metal]]s are poured into casts, to make metal things of a certain shape. Aluminum and cast iron are most commonly casted in foundries, but other metals, like bronze, can be casted as well. During casting, parts of different sizes and shapes can be made. 
 
 Foundries also recycle used metals and recasts them into more useful forms.
