 '''Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus''' < ref > Pompey's full name was ''Gnaeus Pompeius Gnaeī fīlius Sextī nepōs Magnus'' ( " Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, son of Gnaeus, grandson of Sextus " ) in Classical Latin spelling < /ref >  (29 September 106 BC – 28 September 48 BC), otherwise known as '''Pompey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|m|p|iː}}) or '''Pompey the Great''', was an important military and political leader of the late [[Roman Republic]].  
 
 Coming from an Italian provincial background, he secured a place for himself in the ranks of Roman nobility, and was given the [[nickname]] ''Magnus''  ( " the Great " ) by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. 
 
 Pompey was a rival of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] and an ally to [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]. Together, the three politicians would dominate the Late Roman republic through a political alliance called the [[First Triumvirate]]. After the deaths of Julia and Crassus (54 BC), disputes between Pompey and Caesar over the leadership of the Roman Republic lead to civil war. Pompey was decisively beaten by Caesar at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC, whereupon he fled to [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]], where he was assassinated.

 In the beginning, Pompey said he could defeat Caesar and raise armies merely by stamping his foot on the soil of Italy, but in the spring of 49 & nbsp;BC, Caesar crossed the [[crossed the Rubicon|Rubicon]] and his [[Roman legion|legions]] swept down the [[peninsula]]. Pompey abandoned Rome, and took his legions south towards [[Brundisium]]. Pompey intended build up his army, and wage war against Caesar in the east. Neither Pompey nor the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] thought of taking the vast treasury with them, probably thinking Caesar would not dare take it for himself. It was left in the Temple of Saturn when Caesar and his forces entered Rome. 
 
 Barely escaping Caesar in Brundisium, Pompey crossed over into [[Epirus]]. < ref > Epirus is a region covering northern Greece and southern [[Albania]]. < /ref >  There, during Caesar's Spanish campaign, Pompey had gathered a large force in [[Macedonia]], with nine legions plus contingents from the Roman allies in the east. < ref name= " Boak, History of Rome, pg. 176 " > Boak, Arthur E.R. 1922. ''A history of Rome to 565 A.D.'' MacMillan, New York, 176 < /ref >  His fleet controlled the [[Adriatic]]. Nevertheless, Caesar managed to cross over into Epirus in November 49 & nbsp;BC, and captured [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. < ref name= " Boak, History of Rome, pg. 176 " / >   
 
 Pompey fought Caesar at the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium]] (48 & nbsp;BC), in which Caesar lost 1000 men and Pompey lost 2000. Because he failed to pursue at the moment of Caesar's defeat, Pompey threw away the chance to destroy Caesar's much smaller army. As Caesar himself said,  " Today the enemy would have won, if they had a commander who was a winner "  ([[Plutarch]], & nbsp;65).  
 
 According to [[Suetonius]], it was at this point that Caesar said that  " That man (Pompey) does not know how to win a war " . With Caesar on their backs, the conservatives led by Pompey fled to Greece. Caesar and Pompey had their final showdown at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 & nbsp;BC. The fighting was bitter for both sides, and although Pompey was expected to win, due to advantage in numbers, the brilliant tactics and the superior fighting abilities of Caesar's veterans led to a victory for Caesar. Pompey met his wife Cornelia and his son [[Sextus Pompeius]] on the island of [[Mytilene]]. He then wondered where to go next. He ran to [[Egypt]]. 
 
 After he got to Egypt, Pompey's fate was decided by the advisors of the young king [[Ptolemy & nbsp;XIII]]. While Pompey waited offshore, they argued the cost of offering him refuge with Caesar already en route to Egypt; the king's eunuch [[Pothinus]] won out. According to  Plutarch, Cornelia watched anxiously from the [[trireme]] as Pompey left in a small boat with a few comrades, and headed for a welcoming party on the Egyptian shore. As Pompey got off the boat, he was stabbed to death by men following the orders of Pothinus. < ref name= " Plutarch, Pompey, 79–80 " > Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives, Life of Pompey''.

 Pompey died one day after his 59th birthday. His body remained on the shoreline, to be cremated by his loyal freeman Philip on the rotten planks of a fishing boat. His head and seal were presented to Caesar, who, according to Plutarch, mourned this insult to the greatness of his former ally. Caesar punished his assassins and their Egyptian co-conspirators, putting both Achillas and Pothinus to death. Pompey's ashes were eventually returned to Cornelia, who carried them to his country house near [[Alba Longa|Alba]]. < ref name= " Plutarch, Pompey, 79–80 " / >   
 
 [[Cassius Dio]] describes Caesar's reactions with scepticism. He thinks Pompey's own political misjudgements, rather than treachery, was the cause of his downfall. < ref > [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/42*.html#4.2 Dio, 42,4–5, at Thayer] < /ref >  In Appian's account of the civil war, Caesar has Pompey's severed head buried in Alexandria, in ground reserved for a new temple to the goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. The divine functions of Nemesis (~fate) included the punishment of hubris (pride). < ref > Appian, Bella Civilia, II & nbsp;90, cited in Michael B. Hornum, ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'', Brill, 1993, p.15. < /ref >  For [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], the humiliation of Pompey's end is contrasted to his oversized portrait-head, studded with pearls, and carried in procession during his greatest Triumph. < ref > Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis,'' 37, 14–16. < /ref >
