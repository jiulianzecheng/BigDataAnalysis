 A '''snowball''' is a [[Sphere|ball]] of [[snow]]. They are usually made by a person picking snow up in their hands and pressing it together in the ball the size of their [[hand]]. Snowballs are usually thrown at people or objects as a [[game]] called a '''snowball fight'''. Making snowballs is a common [[wikt:activity|activity]] for [[children]] when it snows.  
 
 Larger snowballs are made by using a ball the size of a hand and rolling it on the ground. As more snow sticks to it, the ball grows larger. Larger snowballs are often used to make [[snowman|Snowmen]]. The term  " Snowball effect "  comes from this. It means as things go on, they get more serious in the same way that a snowball gets larger as it rolls.
