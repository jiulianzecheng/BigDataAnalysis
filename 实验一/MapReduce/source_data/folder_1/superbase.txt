{{Acids and Bases}} 
 In [[chemistry]], a '''superbase''' is an extremely strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. It is a compound that has a high [[affinity]] for [[proton]]s. 
 
 [[Hydroxide]] [[ion]] is the strongest base possible in water (aqueous) solutions, but superbases are much stronger than aqueous bases.  Such bases are useful in [[organic synthesis]] and are [[wikt:fundamental|fundamental]] to [[physical chemistry|physical organic chemistry]].  
 
 Superbases have been described and used since the 1850s. < ref > {{cite web |title= BBC - h2g2 - History of chemistry - acids and bases |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A708257 |accessdate=2009-08-30}} < /ref >   [[Chemical reaction|Reactions]] involving superbases often require special techniques since they are destroyed by water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in the air. [[Inert atmosphere]] techniques and low [[temperature]]s minimize these side reactions. 
 
 ==Definitions== 
 IUPAC defines superbases simply as a  " compound having a very high basicity, such as [[lithium diisopropylamide]] " . < ref > {{cite web |title=IUPAC Gold Book - superacid |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/S06135.html |accessdate=2009-08-30}} < /ref >
