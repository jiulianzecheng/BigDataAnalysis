 ==Characteristics== 
 
 In the Cinquecento the most important center of culture in Italy was [[Rome]], while Florence suffered from the [[Girolamo Savonarola]] rebellion and the end of the [[Medici]] power in the city. 
 
 Indeed, in Rome the [[Pope]] promoted a huge art program (like the construction of [[Saint Peter's Basilica|St. Peter Cathedral]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]]) that brought to the eternal city artists of the level of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Cellini]], and [[Bramante]].

 Michelangelo Buonarroti was one the most famous artists in the Cinquecento Italy: he was a [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], [[architect]], poet, and [[engineer]]. Along with [[Leonardo da Vinci]], he was often called a  " [[Renaissance man]] "  which means that he had great talent in many areas. Michelangelo lived an extremely busy life, creating a great number of artworks. Some of Michelangelo's works are among the most famous that have ever been made. They include two very famous marble statues, ''[[Pieta (Michelangelo)|the Pieta]]'' in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' which once stood in a piazza in [[Florence]] but is now in the Accademia Gallery.  His most famous paintings were huge [[fresco]]s, the [[Sistine Chapel]] Ceiling and the ''Last Judgement''. His most famous work of [[architecture]] was the east end and [[dome]] of Saint Peter's Basilica. 
 
 Only [[Venice]] in Italy was able to reach a similar level to the one of Rome, mainly in paintings: [[Bellini]], [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian|Tiziano]] created their masterpieces in this century. 
 
 The tuscan [[Leonardo da Vinci]] lived the last years of his life in the Cinquecento. He created in this century two of his pictures that are among the best-known paintings in the world: the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and the ''[[Last Supper]]''. 
 
 In 1532 [[The Prince]] -a masterpiece of Italian literature- was published: it was a political treatise by the Italian [[Diplomacy|diplomat]], historian and political theorist [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. 
 
 In architecture the Cinquecento is famous because of [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–80),  " the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance " . Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Arch of Constantine]] to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. 
 
 When he used the “[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif < ref > described by the architectural writer Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) in ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva'' < /ref >  is often referred to as the ''Palladian Arch''. 
 
 The second half of the Cinquecento was characterized by the development of the  " Umanesimo " , related even to science discoveries like the one done by [[Galileo Galilei]] in astronomy and critical thoughts like those of [[Giordano Bruno]]. 
 
 Historically the Cinquecento is characterized by the end of the process of unification of Italy, because of the [[France|French]] invasions and the ''Sack of Rome'' in 1527. Later in the century Italy was devastated by the  " Italian wars "  done mainly between France and the emerging [[Spain]] (a new country that enjoyed the richness and power from the discovery of America done by [[Christopher Columbus|Cristoforo Colombo]]), that divided between themselves the [[Italian Peninsula|Italian peninsula]] and its  " Rinascimento richness " .
