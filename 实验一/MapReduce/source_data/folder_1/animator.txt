 An '''animator''' is an [[artist]] who makes [[drawing]]s for [[movie]]s. The animator makes many drawings which are called  " frames " . These are played very quickly, one after another, to create [[animation]]. It makes it look as if the pictures are moving.  
 
 Animators can work in many areas including [[movie]]s, [[television]], [[video game]]s, and the [[internet]]. There are many ways of making animations. Animators usually work with other people to form a team. These may be other animators, but can also include [[layout]] artists (who design the backgrounds, [[lighting]], and [[camera]] [[angle]]s), [[storyboard]] artists (who draw panels of the action from the [[screenplay|script]]), [[background]] artists (who [[paint]] the  " scenery " ), [[voice actor]]s who speak the words, and [[musician]]s who make the [[music]].
