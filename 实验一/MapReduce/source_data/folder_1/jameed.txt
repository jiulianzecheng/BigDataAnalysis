 '''Jameed''' ({{lang-ar|جميد}}, literally  " hardened " ) is a form of dried [[yoghurt]] made made from [[goat's milk]] or [[sheep]]'s [[milk]].  It is made by draining thick yoghurt of its whey, shaping it into balls, and letting it harden.  Drying prevents spoilage.  
 
 Jameed is eaten in [[Jordan]], especially in [[Bedouin]] cooking. It is also common among the Bedouin in [[Palestine]] , [[Egypt]], and even [[Syria]].  It is also customary to add  to a sauces or soups.
