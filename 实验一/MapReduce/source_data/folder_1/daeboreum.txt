 '''Daeboreum''' (Jeongwol Daeboreum) is the 15th day of the first [[lunar]] month of the [[Korean calendar]]. This is a traditional [[holiday]] in Korea. The moonlight is the symbol of light which sends away the dark, [[disease]] and misfortune.  
 
 When full moon rises to the sky at Daeboreum, it is believed that the first person to see it will have good luck all year.
