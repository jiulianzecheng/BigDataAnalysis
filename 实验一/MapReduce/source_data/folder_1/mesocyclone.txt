 A '''mesocyclone''' is a [[vortex]] of air, about 2 & nbsp;to & nbsp;10 & nbsp;km in diameter (the mesoscale of meteorology), inside a [[convection|convective]] [[storm]]. < ref name= " MesocyloneDef " > {{cite web

 That is, it is air that rises and rotates around a vertical axis, usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, related with a localized [[low pressure area]] inside a [[thunderstorm|severe thunderstorm]]. Such storms can create strong surface winds and a lot of [[hail]]. Mesocyclones often happen together with updrafts in [[supercell]]s, where [[tornado]]es may form.  
 
 The word mesocyclone originated around 1970–75; meso- + cyclone] This word is first recorded in the period 1970–75. meso- is a combining form meaning “middle,” used in the formation of compound words. 
 
 Mesocyclones are normally relatively very small in size; they lie between the synoptic scale (hundreds of kilometers) and small scale (hundreds of meters).
