 '''Clun''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: '''Colunwy''') is a small [[town]] in the south of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|county]] of [[Shropshire]], [[England]]. 
 
 A 2011 census recorded just 680 people living in the town. 
 
 Clun takes its name from the [[River Clun|river]] upon which it stands. The name derives from an earlier '''Colunwy''' and shares its very early British root with the Colne rivers, in [[Lancashire]] and [[Essex]], each of which has a town of the same name on its banks. 
 
 The [[A488 road|A488]] and B4368 roads cross in the town. [[Craven Arms]], [[Bishop's Castle]] (6 miles (10 km) to the north) and [[Ludlow]] are the neighbouring [[Shropshire]] towns, and [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]], which is in [[Powys]], [[Wales]], is 7 miles (11 km) to the south. 
 
 In ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'', [[A. E. Housman]] wrote the verse: < br > 
 " [[Clunton]] and [[Clunbury]], < br > 
 [[Clungunford]] and Clun, < br > 
 Are the quietest places < br > 
 Under the sun. "
