'''Junior''' is when a son has the same [[name]] as the [[father]], in which case he is referred to by his father's name plus Junior. For instance, if the father is Bob Jones, the son would be Bob Jones Junior (or Bob Jones Jr., for short). Of course, the father could also be called Bob Jones Senior (or Bob Jones Sr., for short).
