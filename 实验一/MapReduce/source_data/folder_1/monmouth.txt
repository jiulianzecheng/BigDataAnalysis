 '''Monmouth''' is a small town in south-east [[Wales]]. It is about 2 miles from the border with [[England]]. It is the county town of [[Monmouthshire]], and just under 9,000 people live there. The [[River Wye]] and the River Monnow meet in Monmouth. 
 
 ==History== 
 The [[Roman Britain|Romans]] built a small [[fort]] there called ''Blestium'', but few people lived in the area after the Romans left. Eventually, the [[Normans]] built a [[castle]] by the River Monnow, after they conquered England in 1066. Monmouth grew in the [[Middle Ages]], with a [[priory]] church, and a [[market]] street (now called Monnow Street). This street ran between the castle and a fortified bridge across the river, which is the only fortified bridge of its type in Britain.  [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] of England was born in Monmouth Castle in 1387, but the castle itself was mostly knocked down after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] in the seventeenth century. 
 
 Monmouth was well known at one time for producing Monmouth caps - a sort of woollen headgear worn by soldiers, sailors and others. It also became famous at the end of the eighteenth century, when people such as [[Admiral Nelson]], and many poets and painters, came to visit the beautiful Wye valley nearby. The town also has a famous [[public school]], Monmouth School, which was started in 1615. 
 
 In 1840, an important [[trial]] took place in Monmouth, of [[Chartism|Chartists]] who had protested that more people should be allowed to vote in [[General election|election]]s.  One of the first makers of cars in Britain, [[Charles Rolls]] who founded [[Rolls Royce]], was born just outside the town.  He was killed in an [[airplane]] crash in 1910 at the age of 33; there is a statue of him in the town centre. 
 
 ==The town today== 
 The town is known for its schools and its many shops, as well as for the services that it provides for its surrounding area.  The hills around Monmouth are covered with woodland and farms.  Monmouth is linked by the A40 road to the M4 [[motorway]] at [[Newport]] and the M50 at [[Ross-on-Wye]]. The town is [[Twin town|twinned]] with Carbonne, [[France]] and Waldbronn, [[Germany]]. 
 
 In 2011, [[MonmouthpediA]] was set up as the first [[Wikipedia]] project to cover a whole town.
