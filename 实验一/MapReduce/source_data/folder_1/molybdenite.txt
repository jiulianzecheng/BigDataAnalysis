 '''Molybdenite''' (known by the mineral symbol '''Mol''') < ref name=Mindat > [http://www.mindat.org/min-2746.html Mindat.org] < /ref >  is a [[mineral]] form of [[molybdenum disulfide]]. It is similar to the texture of [[graphite]]. It sometimes has a slippery effect because of its structure, which is made of sheets of [[molybdenum]] and [[sulfur]]. It usually has a [[hexagonal]] shape, or has a [[trigonal]] shape. < ref name=HBM > [http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/molybdenite.pdf Handbook of Mineralogy] < /ref >   
 
 It occurs usually with minerals such as [[quartz]] or [[pyrite]], and can be found in deposits across mines in the western US, notably [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], and [[Arizona]]. It can also be found in [[Mexico]]. Sometimes, [[Rhenium]] can be found in this mineral. It is very similar to [[graphite]] that it can be almost impossible in tell them apart.
