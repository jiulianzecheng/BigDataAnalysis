 A communication '''cable''' is made of many [[wire]]s or [[optical fiber]]s [[wikt:twist|twisted]] together to make a larger wire. Each of these wires may be covered. Some cables contain both electrical wires and optical fibers. There are many kinds of cables, including [[coaxial cable]]s which block out radio or [[magnet]]ic interference from other wires or cables, by having one wire inside an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulated]] tube surrounded by a second wire, acting as a metal tube along the same [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]].   
 
 Electrical cables are usually made of [[copper]], because [[electricity]] moves well through copper, but it is not as expensive as [[silver]] or other better conductors. Cables are sometimes made of [[aluminium]] because it is cheaper than copper. 
 
 The word  " cable "  is also used as [[ellipsis]], or a short form, for  " [[Cable television|cable TV]] " .  
 
 [[Wire rope]]s are a common type of cable. A [[cable car]] is a trolley pulled by a cable.
