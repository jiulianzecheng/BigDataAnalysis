[[File:Anagram Listen = Silent.gif|thumb|Animation for the anagram  " Listen=Silent " ]] 
 An '''anagram''' is a [[puzzle]] where the player has to move all the [[letter]]s in a word to make a new [[word]].  An example would be ''The Morse Code'' and ''Here Comes Dots''. Anagrams are often used in [[fiction]] when a [[fictional character|character]] wants to use a different name. For example, the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' character named Tom Marvolo Riddle made an anagram based on his name,  " ''I Am Lord Voldemort'' " , and began calling himself  " Lord Voldermort " . And the pen name of [[Voltaire]] comes from  " Aroueti " . The word 'nag a ram' is actually an anagram of the word anagram. Common anagram examples are  " dormitory " -rearrange to dirty room,  " listen " -rearrange to silent,  " astronomer " -rearrange to moon starer, and  " a decimal point " -rearrange to I'm a dot in place.
