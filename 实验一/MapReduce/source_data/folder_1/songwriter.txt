A '''songwriter''' is a [[writer]] who creates [[song]]s. A songwriter generally writes songs for [[popular music]], rather than [[art song]]s or [[classical music]]. Many songwriters are also singers, and perform the songs they write - they are called [[singer-songwriter]]s. Other songwriters have their songs performed by other singers. 
 
 == History == 
 The history of writing songs is thousands of years old. Scholars believe that men and women may have created and sung songs even at the time of [[prehistory]]. Many modern [[band]]s have one or two members who write songs for the band. Others have more members contribute songs, or give the whole band credit for writing. Others perform songs by outside writers.
