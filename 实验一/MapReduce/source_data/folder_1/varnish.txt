'''Varnish''' is a [[Transparency|transparent]], hard, protective finish or film primarily used in [[wood]] finishing but also for other materials. Varnish is traditionally a combination of a drying oil, a [[resin]], and a [[solvent]]. 
 
 == Resin == 
 Most [[resin]] or  " gum "  varnishes are made of a natural substance dissolved in a [[solvent]]. The two main types of natural varnishes are ''spirit varnish'' (which uses [[alcohol]] as a solvent) and turpentine or [[petroleum]]-based varnish. Some resins are soluble in both alcohol and turpentine. 
 
 [[Shellac]] is a very widely used single component resin varnish that is dissolved in [[alcohol]]. It is not used outdoors or where it will touch water several times, such as around a sink or bathtub. [[insect]]s in [[South Asia]] make it.
