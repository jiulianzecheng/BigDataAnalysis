 ==History== 
 
 ===In France and Western Europe=== 
 
 Beginning in the early ninth century the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] [[king]]s appointed counts to run local county governments. The counts used viscounts or deputy counts to assist them. < ref name=Lewis114 > Archibald R. Lewis, ''The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718-1050'' (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1965), p. 114 < /ref > 
 
 The viscounts served as [[:wikt:deputies|deputies]] of the county. They had military, financial, administrative and judicial authority. < ref name=Strayer243 > Joseph R. Strayer, 'Viscounts and Viguiers under Philip the Fair', ''Speculum'', Vol. 38, No. 2  (Apr., 1963), p. 243 < /ref >  They carried out court orders and held [[:wikt:courts|courts]] of their own. < ref name=Strayer243/ >  Viscounts also collected money for the king. < ref name=Strayer243/ >  Starting with the [[:wikt:reign|reign]] of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]{{efn|Philip [[:en:wikt:reorganized|reorganized]] his court and used professional civil servants and court [[:wikt:officers|officers]] instead of [[:wikt:advisors|advisors]]. < ref name=Magill736.37 > ''The Middle Ages: Dictionary of World Biography'', Vol 2, ed. Frank N. Magill (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 1998), pp. 736-37 < /ref >  The viscounts served as key local [[:wikt:officials|officials]] the king could rely on. Unlike other officers viscounts could be promoted to higher offices beginning with his reign. < ref name=Magill736.37/ > }} they were paid regular salaries. < ref name=Strayer243/ >  In the early tenth century, viscounts in the south of [[France]] gave themselves the rights of counts for their own profit. In [[Narbonne]] and [[Nimes]] the office became [[:en:wikt:hereditary|hereditary]] just like that of a count. < ref name=CMH437 > ''The New Cambridge Medieval History III C.900-c.1024'', ed. Timothy Reuter (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 437 < /ref >  Elsewhere in France viscounts began [[:wikt:replacing|replacing]] counts where they could. < ref name=CMH437/ >  A Viscounty (or Viscountship) was the office, area or jurisdiction of a viscount. < ref name=CMH437/ >  By the eleventh century viscounts had become hereditary offices in most of [[Western Europe]]. In [[Normandy]], before [[Norman conquest of England|1066]], [[William the Conqueror|Duke William I]] began to view the position of a viscount as being [[:en:wikt:removable|removable]]. < ref > Maurice Powicke, ''The Loss of Normandy: 1189 - 1204; Studies in the History of the Angevin Empire'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), p. 49 < /ref >  After 1066, and as [[King of England]], William made several of his viscounts in Normandy, [[earl]]s in [[England]] (an English earl was about the same as a count in Europe). But there were no viscounts in the English [[peerage]] and he did not create any. 
 
 In eleventh century [[Italy]], the office and the lands of a viscount began to be thought of as the hereditary property of the family. The title, as with that of count or [[marquis]] was used by all [[:wikt:members|members]] of a family. < ref > Chris Wickham, ''Early Medieval Italy: Central Power and Local Society, 400-1000'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989), pp. 143-44 < /ref > 
 
 ===In England=== 
 
 The first introduction of the title of viscount in England was in the fifteenth century. < ref name=Stubbs437 > William Stubbs, ''The Constitutional History of England, in Its Origin and Development'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1878), P. 437 < /ref >  The first to be recognized, John Beaumont was already a viscount in Maine. This was to give him a rank above the barons in the English peerage. < ref name=Stubbs437/ >  Afterward it became a regular rank in the peerage. < ref name=Stubbs437/ >  In England, and later in the United Kingdom, a viscount ranks above a baron but below an earl. The wife of a viscount is called a countess.
