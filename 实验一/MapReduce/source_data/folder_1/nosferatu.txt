 == Plot == 
 In 1838, Thomas Hutter lives in the fictional German city of Wisborg. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Klinowski| first1 = Jacek| last2 = Garbicz| first2 = Adam| title = Feature Cinema in the 20th Century: Volume One: 1913-1950: a Comprehensive Guide| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lpp93FevM2cC & pg=PA1920| accessdate = 18 August 2017| date = 2012| publisher = Planet RGB Limited| isbn = 978-1-62407-564-3| page = 1920 }} < /ref >  His mysterious employer, estate agent Herr Knock, sends Hutter to [[Transylvania]] to visit a new client named Count Orlok who plans to buy a house in Wisborg. Hutter entrusts his loving wife Ellen to his good friend Harding and Harding's sister Annie, before embarking on his long journey. Nearing his destination in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], Hutter stops at an inn for dinner. The locals become frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name and discourage him from traveling to his castle at night, warning of a [[werewolf]] on the prowl. 
 
 The next morning, Hutter takes a coach to a high mountain pass, but the coachman declines to take him any further than the bridge as nightfall is approaching. A black-swathed coach appears after Hutter crosses the bridge and the coachman gestures for him to climb aboard. Hutter is welcomed at a castle by Count Orlok. When Hutter is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. 
 
 Hutter wakes up to a deserted castle the morning after and notices fresh punctures on his neck which, in a letter he sends by courier on horseback to be delivered to his devoted wife, he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house across from Hutter's own home in Wisborg and notices a photo of Hutter's wife, remarking that she has a  " lovely neck. " 
 
 ==Production== 
 [[File:Prana-Film 1.jpg|thumb|The original logo for ''Prana Film''.]] 
 ''Nosferatu'' is Prana Film's only production. < ref > [[#cs|ChiaroScuro]] quoting Thomas Elsaesser < /ref >  Prana Film was founded 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and Albin Grau. Grau had the idea to shoot a vampire film; the inspiration arose from Grau's war experience: in the winter of 1916, a [[Serbia]]n [[farmer]] told him that his father was a vampire and one of the Undead. < ref > {{citation |author=Christiane Mückenberger |author2=Günther Dahlke and Günter Karl (Hrsg.) |chapter=Nosferatu |title= Deutsche Spielfilme von den Anfängen bis 1933 |year=1993 |publisher= Henschel Verlag |location=Berlin |publication-date=1993 |isbn=978-3-89487-009-6 |page=71 |language=German }} < /ref > 
 
 Diekmann and Grau gave Henrik Galeen a job to screenplay inspired from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel ''Dracula'', despite Prana Film not having rights to the film. Galeen was an experienced specialist in Dark [[romanticism]] ; he had already worked on ''Der Student von Prag'' (''The Student of Prague'') in 1913, and the screenplay for 1920's ''Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam'' (''The Golem: How He Came into the World''). Galeen set the story in a fictional north German harbour town named Wisborg and changed the character names. He added the idea of the vampire bringing the plague to Wisborg via rats on the ship. He left out the Van Helsing vampire hunter character. Galeen's German Expressionism < ref > {{citation |author=Roger Manvell|title=Henrik Galeen - Films as writer:, Other films |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Ei-Gi/Galeen-Henrik.html |publisher=Film Reference |accessdate=2009-04-23 |postscript=}} < /ref >  screenplay was poetically rhythmic, without being so dismembered as other books influenced by literary [[Expressionism]], such as those by Carl Mayer. Lotte Eisner described Galeen's screenplay as  " ''{{lang|de|voll Poesie, voll Rhythmus}}'' "  ( " full of poetry, full of rhythm " ). < ref name= " Eisner67-27 " > Eisner 1967, page 27 < /ref > < !-- to add: Dieckmann and Grau get director Murnau; Grau does art direction, sets and costume; music by Hans Erdmann; < ref name= " cs " / >  lead the unknown Max Schreck; other cast from actors schooled by expressionist Maxamillion Reinhardt ... -- > 
 
 Dieckmann and Gray won the director [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]], who made movies until 1919, but had made ​​his first seven productions a reputation as a talented filmmaker. Gray, who had studied at the Art Academy in Dresden, took over as artistic director and designed sets and costumes. For the soundtrack of the musical director of the Prana-Film Hans Erdmann was responsible. The unknown stage actor Max Schreck from Munich, was committed for the title role. Other roles took on expressionist theater of Max Reinhardt trained actors like Greta Schröder, Gustav von Wangenheim, and Alexander Granach, a former classmate at Murnau Reinhardt's acting school at the Deutsches Theater. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Klein| first1 = Albert| last2 = Kruk| first2 = Raya| title = Alexander Granach| year = 1994| isbn = 978-3-89468-108-1 }} < /ref > 
 
 [[File:Lübeck-Salzspeicher an der Trave.JPG|upright|thumb|left|This Lübecker Salzspeicher served as the set for Orlok's house in Wisborg.]] 
 Filming began in July 1921. Exterior shots were filmed in [[Wismar]]. < ref name= " cs " > [[#cs|ChiaroScuro]] < /ref >  A [[take]] from Marienkirche's tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations were the [[Wassertor]], the [[Heiligen-Geist-Kirche]] yard and the harbour. In [[Lübeck]], the abandoned Salzspeicher served as Nosferatu's new Wisborg house, the one of the churchyard from Aegidienkirche served as Hutters and down the Depenau ''coffin bearers'' beared [[coffin]]s. Many walks of Lübeck took place in the hunt of ''Knock'' who ordered Hutter in the ''Yard of Füchting'' to meet the earl. Further exterior shots followed in [[Lauenburg/Elbe|Lauenburg]], < ref name= " cs " / >  [[Rostock]] < ref name= " cs " / >  and on [[Sylt]]. The film team travelled to the [[Carpathian Mountains]], where Orava Castle < ref name= " cs " / >  served as backdrop for Orlok's half-ruined castle. Nearby locations also served: Hutter's stay at [[Dolný Kubín]]; < ref name= " cs " / >  the river journey with the coffins filmed on the Váh River; and the panoramas of the [[High Tatras]] mountain range. The team filmed interior shots at the JOFA studio in [[Berlin]]'s [[Johannisthal (Berlin)|Johannisthal]] [[wikt:locality|locality]]. < ref name= " cs " / >  and further exteriors in the Tegel forest. < ref name= " cs " / >   Parts of the film set in [[Transylvania]] were also shot in [[Slovakia]]. 
 
 For cost reasons, cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera available, and therefore there was only one original negative. < ref > [[#Prin|Prinzler page 222]]: Luciano Berriatúa and Camille Blot in section: ''Zur Überlieferung der Filme''. Then it was usual to use at least two cameras in parallel to maximise the number of copies for distribution. One negative would serve for local use and another for foreign distribution. < /ref >  The director followed Galeen's screenplay carefully, following handwritten instructions on camera positioning, lighting, and related matters. < ref > [[#de|Editors of German Wikipedia]] citing [[#Eisner67|Eisner 1967 page 27]] < /ref >  Nevertheless, Murnau completely rewrote 12 pages of the script, as Galeen's text was missing from the director's working script. < ref name= " de " > [[#de|Editors of German Wikipedia]] < /ref >  This concerned the last scene of the film, in which Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the Sun. < ref > [[#de|Editors of German Wikipedia]] citing [[#Eisner67|Eisner 1967 page 28]] Since vampires dying in daylight appears neither in Stoker's work nor in Galeen's script, this concept has been solely attributed to Murnau. < /ref > < ref > {{citation |author=Michael Koller |date=July 2000 |title=Nosferatu |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/8/nosferatu.html |work=Issue 8, July–Aug 2000 |publisher=senses of cinema |accessdate=2009-04-23 |postscript= |archive-date=2009-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705132857/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/8/nosferatu.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Murnau prepared carefully; there were sketches that were to correspond exactly to each filmed scene, and he used a [[metronome]] to control the pace of the acting. < ref > [[#de|Editors of German Wikipedia]] citing [[#Grafe|Grafe page 117]] < /ref > 
 
 Since the camera was mostly static and immobile to Nosferatu, Murnau used movement and differentiation within the rigid cadre in order to energize the scene. As Orloks ship slowly moves from right to left through the movie screen, Murnau used this so Eisner's  " powerful effect[s] of the impression of transverse motion. " < ref name= " Eisner1980-101 " > {{cite book| last = Eisner| first = Lotte H.| title = Die damonische Leinwand| year = 1980| isbn = 978-3-596-23660-2 }} < /ref >  would stress education. This served the same purpose [[point-of-view shot|subjectifications of the camera view]], such as when the vampire filmed on the ship from the [[frog perspective]] or stand looking out of windows, parts of the frame and shoots into view . The highlight of the subjectivated gaze are the scenes in which the vampire character - directly facing the camera - turns to the audience and thus the [[fourth wall]] is broken:  " The vampire seems by its immensity, the dimensions of the screen to blow up and the viewers to directly threaten  " < ref > Klaus Becker.''

 This was Prana Film's only movie because the movie was a financial failure as a limited release. The UFA refused to take the film in the program of their large movie theaters, and so Nosferatu was only shown in a few small theaters. < ref > Herbert Lewandowski:  " A look behind the scenes " .

The court ordered all existing prints of ''Nosferatu'' burned, but one purported copy of the film had already been distributed around the world. These prints were duplicated over the years. < ref > {{cite web|url= http://jerrysaravia.blogspot.com/2011/02/plague-carrier.html |title=Jerry Saravia's thoughts on cinema and pop culture |id= Nosferatu: The Plague-Carrier |date= February 6, 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Reception== 
 Despite the movie's failure and Prana Film's bankruptcy in 1922, the film received critically positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] says that 98% of critical reviews were positive (53 out of a total 55 reviews) with an average rating of 3.9/5, stating,  " One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, gothic feel -- and a chilling performance from Max Schreck as the vampire -- set the template for the horror films that followed. " < ref name =  " Rotten Tomatoes " / > 
 
 [[Roger Ebert]] called it  " more effective for being "  a  " silent "  film. He concluded, 
 :  " There is no repartee in nightmares. Human speech dissipates the shadows and makes a room seem normal. Those things that live only at night do not need to talk, for their victims are asleep, waiting.

 ==In other media== 
 [[Aaron Copland]]'s 1922 ballet ''Grohg'' (unpublished and unpremiered until 1992) used ''Nosferatu'' as the physical model for the lead character and roughly follows the storyline. 
 
 [[Hugh Cornwell]] of [[the Stranglers]] and [[Robert Williams (drummer)|Robert Williams]] recorded an album ''[[Nosferatu (Hugh Cornwell and Robert Williams album)|Nosferatu]]'' as a  " soundtrack "  to the film, dedicated to the memory of [[Max Schreck]]; it was released in 1979. The front cover was a still picture from the film. 
 
 [[Werner Herzog]]'s 1979 homage to Nosferatu, ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' starred [[Klaus Kinski]] as Count Dracula, not Orlok. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/Nosferatu-the-Vampyr-v127854 |title=Nosferatu the Vampyr |work=Allrovi |accessdate=September 6, 2011 |author=Erickson, Hal |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717093933/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/Nosferatu-the-Vampyr-v127854 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   A sequel to Herzog's film called ''[[Vampire in Venice]]'' starred Kinski, this time as Nosferatu, and [[Christopher Plummer]] as Paris Catalano. 
 
 The 1979 television movie ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV mini-series)|Salem's Lot]]'' modeled the appearance of Mr. Barlow on that of Count Orlok. < ref name= " cinefantas " > ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine vol. 9 #2 < /ref >   In 1998, [[Wayne Keeley]] released ''[[Nosferatu: The First Vampire]]'', in which the original film was remastered to a soundtrack by [[Type O Negative]] and hosted by [[David Carradine]]. 
 
 The 2000 [[Hollywood]] movie ''[[Shadow of the Vampire]]'' told a secret history of the making of ''Nosferatu'', imagining that actor [[Max Schreck]] (played by [[Willem Dafoe]]) was actually a genuine vampire and that director [[F. W. Murnau]] ([[John Malkovich]]) was complicit in hiring the creature for the purpose of [[realism]]. 
 
 Similarly, the short film [http://www.naschy.com/duodecimahora.html 'La duodécima hora'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301021737/http://www.naschy.com/duodecimahora.html |date=2012-03-01 }} < ref > [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135486/La duodécima hora]{{Dead link|date=June 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at the [[Internet Movie Database]] < /ref >  by Rodrigo Plaza and film critic Juanma Ruiz, suggested a hidden plot orchestrated by Nosferatu director and producer, [[F. W. Murnau]] and [[Albin Grau]], to hide an elixir of the eternal life. Shot as a mockumentary, the film starred horror icon [[Paul Naschy]] and Nosferatu film restorer [[Luciano Berriatúa]]. 
 
 [[Viper Comics]]'s 2010 [[graphic novel]] ''[[Nosferatu (comics)|Nosferatu]]'' by [[Christopher Howard Wolf]] retold the original 1922 film's storyline with a modern setting and cast. 
 
 The [[Cartoon Network]] [[Adult Swim]] series [[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]], a parody of classic horror movies and characters, features Nosferatu as a recurring character.
