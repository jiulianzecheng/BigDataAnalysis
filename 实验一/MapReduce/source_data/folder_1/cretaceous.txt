 The '''Cretaceous''' period is the ninth and longest period in the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, lasting 80 million years from 145 to 65 million years ago (mya). It followed the [[Jurassic]] period, and is the third and last period of the [[Mesozoic]] era. After it came the [[Cainozoic]] [[era]]. < ref > Levin, Harold 2006. ''The Earth through time''. Wiley, Hoboken N.J. Chapters 13  &  14 < /ref >   
 The Cretaceous period has just two very long [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]]: 
 * [[Upper Cretaceous]] 100.5 million years ago (mya) to 65 mya 
 * [[Lower Cretaceous]] 145.5 mya to 100.5 mya. 
 The Lower Cretaceous at ~45 million years, is the longest epoch in the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]]. 
 
 Though famous for its land [[fauna]], the Cretaceous [[sea level]] rose much higher than today. [[North America]] was partly covered by an epicontinental [[inland sea]], and half of [[Britain]] was under water. One account goes as follows:  " During the Late Cretaceous (94–64 mya) sea level was up to 650 metres higher than at the start of the Albian, when it was perhaps about the same as it is today... The peak transgressions (sea levels) can be seen world-wide. There were rises of sea level of about 10–90 metres per m.y. "   < ref > Hancock J.M.  &  Kauffman E.G. 1979. ''Journal of the Geological Society of London'' '''136''', 175/186. [https://doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.136.2.0175 ] < /ref > 
 
 In the Upper Cretaceous, [[chalk]], a type of [[limestone]], was laid down in warm shallow seas. Chalk is 95% to 99% made up of [[coccolith]]s, the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) plates which tiny single-celled [[algae]] (coccolithophorids) produce. 
 At its end came the famous [[meteorite]] strike which, with the [[volcano|volcanic]] flood [[basalt]]s spewed out in the [[Deccan Plateau]] ([[India]]), ended so many of the dominant life-forms: see [[K/T extinction event]].
