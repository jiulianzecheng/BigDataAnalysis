 An '''anaesthetic''' ('''anesthetic''') is a [[substance]] that either stops [[pain]], or causes the user to [[sleep]]. 
 There are two types: general anaesthesia causes a reversible loss of [[consciousness]]. Local anaesthetic cause a loss of sensitivity (and pain) on a local area.  
 
 Anaesthetics can be rubbed onto the skin, given by [[injection]] ( " shot " ), or given as a [[gas]] to [[breathe]].  Anaesthesia blocks pain during operations. This lets patients undergo [[surgery]] and other procedures without the distress and pain they would normally feel. It comes from the Greek roots an-,  " without "  and aesthetos,  " perceptible, able to feel " .

 The history of modern anaesthetic began with [[Joseph Lister]]. Before it, people sometimes used [[cocaine]], [[alcohol]], and other drugs to get the same effects. Modern anaesthesia is complex, with a combination of anesthesia, [[analgesic|analgesia]] and muscle relaxation. These three are known as the  " triad of anesthesia " .
