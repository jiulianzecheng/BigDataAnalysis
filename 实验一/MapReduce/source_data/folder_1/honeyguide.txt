 '''Honeyguides''' ([[family (biology)|family]] '''Indicatoridae''') are near-[[passerine]] [[birds]] of the order [[Piciformes]].  They are also known as 'indicator birds', or 'honey birds'. 
 
 They have an [[Old World]] tropical distribution, with most species in [[Africa]] and two in [[Asia]]. These birds are known for their interaction with humans. One or two species will deliberately lead humans to bee colonies, so that they can feast on the [[grub]]s and [[beeswax]] that are left behind. < ref > Friedmann, Herbert 1955. ''The Honeyguides''.

 The breeding behavior of eight species in ''Indicator'' and ''Prodotiscus'' is known. They are all [[brood parasite]]s that lay an egg in a nest of another species. Most prefer hole-nesting species, often the related [[Lybiidae|barbets]] and [[woodpecker]]s, but ''Prodotiscus'' parasitizes cup-nesters such as [[white-eye]]s and [[Old World warbler|warblers]]. Honeyguide nestlings have been known to throw out their host's chicks from the nest. They have hooks on their [[beak]]s with which they puncture the hosts' eggs or kill the nestlings. < ref name=EoB > {{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Short, Lester L.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of animals: birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 155|isbn= 1-85391-186-0}} < /ref > 
 
 African honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species. The honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching, much as [[cuckoo]] hatchlings do. The honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it, so that it has a head start in development compared to the host. < ref > Davies, Ella [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14802180  " Underground chick-killers filmed " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231085630/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14802180 |date=2017-12-31 }}, ''[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Nature'' < /ref >
