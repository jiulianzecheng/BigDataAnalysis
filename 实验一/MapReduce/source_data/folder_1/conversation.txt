 A '''conversation''' is two or more people [[talking]] about something. It is [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]], usually unplanned, though the people may have interests in common.  
 
 Conversations are one of the basic types of human communication. They can be about any subject, and do not necessarily have any fixed purpose. They allow people with different views of a topic to learn from each other. A conversation may be contrasted with formal presentations. A talk or [[speech]], for example is an oral presentation by one person directed at a group. It is basically a one-way communication. 
 
 Conversations do not have to happen in person, they can happen over the [[telephone]] or on the [[Internet]]. 
 
 == Banter == 
 Banter is short witty [[sentence]]s that bounce back and forth between individuals. Often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults. It can contain misunderstandings (often intentional), zippy wisecracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns. The idea is each line of banter should  " top "  the one before it. It is a verbal war of wit without any physical contact.
