'''Income''' is the [[money]] that someone gets for business activities. For individuals income usually means their [[wages]] or [[salary]] before any [[tax]] and other deductions have been made by their [[employer]]. Overall it is the amount you earn after all outstanding deductions have been made. '''Gross income''' is the income from all sources including wages or salary. 
 
 For business, there is a difference between the US, where it most often means the amount of money that a company earns after paying for all its costs, and the world outside the U.S., where the term is usually [[profit]] or [[earnings]].
