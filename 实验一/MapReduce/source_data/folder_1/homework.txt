 '''Homework''', or a '''homework assignment''', is a set of tasks assigned to [[Student|students]] by their [[Teacher|teachers]] to be completed outside the [[classroom]]. Common homework assignments may include required [[reading]], a writing or [[typing]] project, mathematical exercises to be completed, information to be read before a [[Test (assessment)|test]], or other skills to be practiced.   
 
 The effects of homework are debated, since it lowers self esteem. It also may not actually help students since everyone learns differently. Generally speaking, homework does not help young children. Homework may help older students, especially low-achieving students. However, homework also creates [[Stress (biology)|stress]] for students and [[Parent|parents]], and reduces the amount of time that students can spend in other activities. < ref > Cooper, Harris; Robinson, Jorgianne C.  &  Patall, Erika A. 2006.

 Homework dates back to the [[1900s]], though it may have existed from earlier. < ref > {{Cite web|date=1999-12-19|title=HISTORY OF HOMEWORK|url=https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/HISTORY-OF-HOMEWORK-3053660.php|access-date=2020-08-18|website=SFGate}} < /ref >
