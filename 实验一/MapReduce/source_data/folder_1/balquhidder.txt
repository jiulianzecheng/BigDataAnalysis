 '''Balquhidder''' ({{lang-gd|Both Chuidir}}) is a small village in the [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling]] [[council area]] of [[Scotland]]. It is overlooked by the dramatic mountain terrain of the [[Braes of Balquhidder]], at the head of [[Loch Voil]]. [[Balquhidder Glen]] is also popular for fishing, nature watching and walking. Above the village, Creag an Tuirc is a fine viewpoint, well worth the short climb.
