 '''Goslar''' is a historic city in [[Germany]]. About 43,000 people live there. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:goslar.jpg|left|thumb|]] 
 The German Emperor Henry I founded Goslar in 922. In the 11th century Goslar became seat of a [[Pfalz]], a temporary seat of the Emperor. In 1253 Goslar became a Free City (that means without being ruled a Duke) in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and joined the [[Hanseatic League]]. 
 
 [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry 4th]] a Holy Roman Emperor came from Goslar. 
 
 In the [[Thirty-year War]] Goslar belonged to the loyalists of the Emperor, although its territory belonged to a [[Protestant]] region. The Swedish King Gustav II Adolph punished Goslar for supporting the imperial forces. After 1642 Goslar came under the rule of the [[Welfs]]. 
 
 In 1803 Goslar lost its status as a Free City and belonged to [[Prussia]]. [[Napoleon]] made Goslar a part of the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]]. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] it became part of the Kingdom of [[Hanover]]. 
 
 In the 19th century Goslar lost its economic base. Now it lives mainly on [[tourism]].
