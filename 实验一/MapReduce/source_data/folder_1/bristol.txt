 '''Bristol''' is a [[city]] and [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] in [[England]]. It is home to nearly 430,000 people. The [[River Avon]] runs through it to the Severn [[estuary]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 It is between the [[county|counties]] of [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Somerset]]. In 1373, King [[Edward III]] ordered that it should be a county itself forever. However, it lost county status in 1974, the year after its 600-year celebrations. It became the largest district within the new [[Avon (county)|Avon]] county. Avon was never popular and was abolished in 1996, when county status returned to Bristol, which became a unitary council. 
 
 == History == 
 The Bristol name means  " the place where the bridge is "  in Old [[English language|English]]. It has been a port for 800 years. Now, ships are too big to reach it. It has a new seaport at Avonmouth. 
 
 === Historical sites === 
 It has many historic churches and other buildings. The Clifton Suspension Bridge crosses high above the river. The [[University of Bristol]] is also in Clifton. 
 
 Bristol was a centre for the [[slave trade]]. < ref > {{Cite magazine|url=https://time.com/5850135/edward-colston-statue-slave-trader-protests/|title=The Growing Effort to Remove Monuments of Europe's Racist Past|magazine=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-06-10}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://coolbison.co.uk/|title=Bristol Business}} Wednesday, 1 February 2017 < /ref >   During the 2020 [[George Floyd protests]], a crowd pushed down the statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston and threw it in the harbour. < ref name= " BristolReuters " > {{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-britain-s/toppled-statue-of-english-slave-trader-to-be-moved-to-a-museum-idUSKBN23H23K|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=June 10, 2020|date=June 10, 2020|title=Toppled statue of English slave trader to be moved to a museum}} < /ref >
