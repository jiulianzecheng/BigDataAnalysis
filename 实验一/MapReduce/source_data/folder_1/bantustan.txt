 A '''Bantustan''' (also known as a '''Bantu homeland''', '''black homeland''', '''black state''', or simply '''homeland''') was a territory set aside for South Africa's black inhabitants during [[apartheid]]. Ten Bantustans were established in [[South Africa]] and ten more in [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]), with the goal of creating [[nation state]]s for the black tribes of Africa. The term ''Bantustan'' comes from ''Bantu'' (meaning  " people "  in the [[Bantu languages]]) and ''-stan'' (meaning  " land "  in [[Persian language|Persian]]). 
 
 The founders of apartheid tried hard to make the Bantustans recognised internationally, but this never happened, and most blacks did not like the Bantustans. They were unpopular because: 
 
 *The borders of the Bantustans were drawn to exclude valuable land. 
 *The large number of reassigned citizens combined with the small size of the Bantustans meant that a lot of people had to share small amounts of land, compared to how people lived in the rest of South Africa. 
 *Becoming citizens of the new territories meant losing citizenship of South Africa, where the majority of candidates for reassignment of citizenship lived and worked. This would cause them to lose what few rights and privileges they had as citizens of South Africa. 
 
 The Bantustans were dissolved in 1994 and their territory incorporated into the Republic of South Africa. From 1994, most parts of the country were redivided into new provinces.
