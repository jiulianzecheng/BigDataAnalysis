'''Samoset''' (ca. 1590–1653) was the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to speak with the [[Pilgrims]] in [[Plymouth Colony]]. On March 16, 1621, the people were very surprised when Samoset walked straight into Plymouth Colony where the people were living.  He greeted them in English. Samoset said he had learned some of the language from some [[English people|English]] [[fishermen]] that came to [[Maine]]. < ref name= " Edward Winslow 1865 pp. 83 " > Edward Winslow; William Bradford (1865) [1622].

 Samoset was member of the [[Wampanoag]] tribe that lived in Maine.  He was an important man within his tribe. Samoset talked with the leaders of Plymouth Colony.  A few days later he came back with [[Squanto]], an native  [[leader]] who also spoke  English. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hmenai/squanto_tisquantum_1590_1622 |title=Squanto (Tisquantum) (1590? - 1622) |first= |last= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of North American Indians|year=1996 |accessdate=8 June 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 Samoset is also sometimes called Somerset. The name Somerset may have been given by the English men who came from [[Somerset]] in [[England]]. < ref > {{cite journal| last = Matthews| first = Albert| title = Note on the Indian Sagamore Samoset| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vvo7AAAAIAAJ & pg=PA60| accessdate = 2008-12-02| volume = 6| year = 1904| publisher = The Society| location = Boston| oclc = 1564125| pages = 59–70 at 60| journal = Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts }}

 == Samoset Comes to Plymouth Colony - From ''Mourt's Relation'' (1622) == 
 This is part of an account of the first meeting with Samoset by the people of Plymouth Colony: 
 
 {{cquote|Friday the 16th was a fair warm day....We were finishing our work, when a strange looking men, a man which caused us to be surprised becaused he seemed unafraid ....  walked into the village.  We stopped him. ... He spoke to us in English, and was friendly.  He said he had learned some English among the Englishmen that came to fish at Monhegan Island, and he gave us their names. He was a man who spoke freely and openly. We questioned him about many things.  He was the first Indian we met. He said he was from Morattiggon and been 8 months in these parts.  He told us of every area, and of their chiefs, and their number of men. The wind being to rise a little, we put a coat about him, for he wore very little clothes.  He had a bow and two arrows.  He was a tall straight man, the hair of his head black and very long but had no hair on his face at all; he asked for a drink and we gave him strong water and biscuit, and butter, and cheese, and pudding, and a piece of mallard (duck), all which he liked well.  He said he had also eaten this food before with the English that had come before where he was from. 
 
 He told us the place where we now live was known as Patuxet by the [[Native Americans|Indians]]. Four years ago all the Indians who lived there died of a sickness and none were left, so they cannot hurt us, or to say the land where we now live belongs to them.  All the afternoon we spent talking with him; we thought he would leave that night, but he did not leave. Then we thought to carry him on shipboard, and he intended to leave, but the wind was high and the water not deep enough so he could not return back that day. We lodged him that night at [[Stephen Hopkins (Mayflower passenger)|Stephen Hopkins]] house, and watched him. 
 
 The next day he went back to the [[Massasoit]]s, the tribe of Indians where he lived.  Before he left, Samoset told us that his tribe lived were our nearest neighbors.  Samoset told us that there were sixty Indians in the tribe. He also told us of another tribe, the Nausets, which were southeast of Plymouth Colony had one hundred men within the tribe. He warned us that this group of Indians were very angry at the Europeans, and about 8 months ago killed three Englishmen, and two more escaped to Monchiggon. Samoset said they were Sir Ferdinando Gorges and his men.  He was very surprised at the tools the [[Europe]]ans had brought with them and said he would return to the woods where they were and bring them to us.  He also said that some of Indians had a cruel trick played on them by the Europeans.  They had taken twenty Indians, and carried them away, and sold them for [[slaves]]. 
 
 Saturday, in the morning we said goodbye to Samoset, and gave him a [[knife]], a [[bracelet]], and a [[ring]].  He promised within a night or two to come again, and to bring with him some of the Massasoits, our neighbors, with such beavers' skins as they could carry with them. < ref name= " Edward Winslow 1865 pp. 83 " / > }}
