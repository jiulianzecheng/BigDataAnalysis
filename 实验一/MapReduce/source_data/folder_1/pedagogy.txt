 '''Pedagogy''' is the [[art]] or [[science]] of being a [[teacher]] and of [[learning]]. 
 The word pedagogy comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''paidagōgeō'', which means  " to lead the child. "   < ref > [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pedagogue Etymology Site on-line (pedagogue)] < /ref >   In [[Ancient Greece]], rich men had a [[slave]] to instruct their sons as a [[tutor]], or to take them to the [[academy]].  Girls were almost entirely [[home school|home schooled]], but many boys went to school even if they had a tutor. 
 
 ==Academic degree== 
 An [[academic degree]] is sometimes given for pedagogy. In the [[United States of America]] and [[Great Britain]], you can earn a degree in [[education]] at the Bachelor's (undergraduate; BA or BS) or Master's (graduate; MA or MS) level. You can also earn an advanced degree called either a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), or a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.); you can also get a degree for specific things, like a Doctor of Music degree in [[piano]] pedagogy. 
 
 ==Criticism== 
 Some people do not like the idea of pedagogy. They say that learning is something that a person does for themselves, not something that a person imposes on another person. < ref > Greenberg, D.
