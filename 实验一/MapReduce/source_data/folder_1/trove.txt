 '''Trove''' is an [[Australia]]n online library database aggregator and service which includes [[full-text database|full text documents]], [[digital image]]s, [[Library catalog|bibliographic and holdings data]] of items which are not available digitally, and a free [[faceted search|faceted-search]] engine as a discovery tool. The database includes [[archives]], images, newspapers, official documents, [[web archiving|archived websites]], [[manuscripts]] and other types of data. Hosted by the [[National Library of Australia]] in partnership with content providers, including members of the [[National and State Libraries Australia]], it is one of the most well-respected and accessed [[GLAM (industry sector)|GLAM]] services in Australia, with over 70,000 daily users. 
 
 In the wake of government funding cuts since 2015, the National Library and other organisations have been struggling to keep up with ensuring that content on Trove is kept flowing through and up to date.
