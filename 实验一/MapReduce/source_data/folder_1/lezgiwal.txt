 '''Lezgival''' ( [[Lezgi language|Lezgian]] : Лезгивал/Lezgiwal) is the [[Lezgi language|Lezgin]] ethic code. It is a combination of Islam and Lezgin adats. The basis of Lezgiwal rules includes the importance of respect for elders and women, not bowing down to those who are stronger than themselves, compassion for the weak, honesty, honor and courage. A Lezgin's behavior towards the environment is always subject to this law, wherever he is. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Халилрин Шамил|date=20 April 2020|title=Лезгивал|url=https://www.alamjurnal.com/2862-lezgival/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613113040/https://www.alamjurnal.com/2862-lezgival/|archive-date=13 June 2021|access-date=13 June 2021|website=АЛАМ|language=ru-RU}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|title=|publisher=|year=|location=|pages=|agency=}} < /ref >
