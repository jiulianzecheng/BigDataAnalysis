 }}'''Phish''' is an [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band. They formed in [[Vermont]] in [[1983]], broke up in [[2004]], and reformed in [[2009]]. Their lead singer is Trey Anastasio. Phish was often compared to the Grateful Dead, and had a similar following of  " Phish Heads "  following the band on tour. They went on a 5-year-long hiatus from 2004 to 2009. Their hiatus ended when they played shows on March 6, 7 and 8 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, VA. The band surprised the audience with longer sets than usual. 
 
 Their music has a lot of [[improvisation]], so when they play live, their songs are sometimes a lot longer. They use elements from many genres, including [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[progressive rock]], [[bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[reggae]], [[blues]], [[Latin music|Latin]], and [[psychedelic rock]].
