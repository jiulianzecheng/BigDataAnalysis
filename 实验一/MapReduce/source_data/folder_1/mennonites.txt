 The '''Mennonites''' are a group of  [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Anabaptist]]s named after [[Menno Simons]] (1496–1561). His teachings were a relatively minor influence on the group, though.  They are of the historic ''[[peace churches]]''. Mennonites are committed to [[nonviolence]], nonviolent resistance/reconciliation, and [[pacifism]]. 
 
 There are about 1.5 million Mennonites worldwide as of 2006. < ref name= " autogenerated1 " > [http://www.mwc-cmm.org/en/PDF-PPT/2006mbictotal.pdf 2006 Mennonite  &  Brethren in Christ World Membership] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626021517/http://www.mwc-cmm.org/en/PDF-PPT/2006mbictotal.pdf |date=2008-06-26 }} - Mennonite World Conference < /ref >  There are many different types of mennonite communities in the world. There are those that dress in old-fashioned ways, and others which are hard to tell apart from other people leading a modern lifestyle. Most Mennonites are in the [[United States]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], but Mennonites can also be found in tight-knit communities in at least 51 countries on six continents or scattered amongst the populace of those countries. 
 
 Mennonites have an international distinction among Christian denominations in [[disaster relief]]. They also place a strong theological emphasis on voluntary service. Mennonite Disaster Service, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mds.mennonite.net/|title=Mennonite Disaster Service|accessdate=2007-05-30|archive-date=2007-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601115555/http://www.mds.mennonite.net/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  based in [[North America]], provides both immediate and long-term responses to [[hurricane]]s, [[flood]]s, and other disasters. [[Mennonite Central Committee]] provides disaster relief around the world alongside their long-term international development programs. Other programs offer a variety of relief efforts and services throughout the world. 
 
 In the last few decades some Mennonite groups have also become more actively involved with [[peace]] and [[social justice]] issues, helping to found [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]] and Mennonite Conciliation Service. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://conciliationserv.mennonite.net/|title=Mennonite Conciliation Service|accessdate=2007-05-30|archive-date=2007-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513145148/http://conciliationserv.mennonite.net/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
