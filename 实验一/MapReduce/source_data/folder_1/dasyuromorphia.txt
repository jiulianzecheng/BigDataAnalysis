 '''Dasyuromorphia''' are fair-sized [[Order (biology)|order]] of some of the more unusual [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[Insectivore|insectivorous]] [[marsupial]]s. They vary in appearance, from [[rodent]]-like to [[shrew]]-like to [[cat]]-like to [[dog]]-like. This order includes the ever-famous [[Tasmanian devil]]. In this order, most of the marsupials have a pouch on the belly. However, some of the broad-footed marsupial [[mice]] have only folds of [[skin]] instead of true pouches, and the [[numbat]] lacks a pouch entirely. There are 63 species in 3 families, although one of the families is probably extinct: 
 
 * '''[[Dasyuridae]]''' (quolls, native cats, marsupial mice, [[Tasmanian devil]]s) 61 species 
 * '''Myrmecobiidae''' ([[numbat]]s) 1 species 
 * '''[[Thylacinidae]]''' (Tasmanian wolf or [[thylacine]] - probably extinct) 1 species
