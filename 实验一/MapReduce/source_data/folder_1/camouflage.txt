 '''Camouflage''' is a visual [[wikt:disguise|disguise]]. Without it, an animal would be [[wikt:recognise|recognised]] easily. If the natural color of an animal makes it look like its surroundings, that is camouflage. One example is a [[tiger]]'s stripes in the long grass. 
 
 Camouflage is a form of [[wikt:deception|deception]]. The word camouflage comes from the [[French language|French]] word ''camoufler,'' which means  " to disguise " . < ref name= " etym1 " > {{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camouflage|title=Online Etymology Dictionary – Camouflage|accessdate=2007-02-22|year=2001|author=Harper, Douglas|work=Etymonline.com|format=php}} < /ref > < ref name= " dict1 " > {{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=camouflage|title=Camouflage|accessdate=2007-02-22|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC|work=Dictionary.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Natural camouflage == 
 In nature, most animals [[wikt:blend|blend]] into their environment or [[wikt:conceal|conceal]] their shape. They are very hard to see. This way they survive, and if they survive, then they can reproduce. There are exceptions: animals which are dangerous to eat (e.g. [[wasp]]s) advertise with [[Mimicry#Warning coloration|warning coloration]]. < ref name=Wickler > Wickler W. 1968. ''Mimicry in plants and animals''. McGraw-Hill, New York < /ref > 
 
 [[Prey]] animals hide from [[predator]]s. Predators must search for prey without being seen. Natural camouflage is one way to do this: an animal can blend in with its surroundings. Another way is for the animal to [[wikt:disguise|disguise]] itself as something harmless. < ref > Owen, Dennis1980. ''Camouflage and mimicry''. Oxford. < /ref > < ref name=Cott > Cott, Hugh B. 1940. ''Adaptive colouration [sic] in animals''. Methuen, London. < /ref > 
 
 Some camouflaged animals also copy movements in nature, e.g., of a leaf blowing in the wind. Other animals attach natural materials to their body for concealment. A few animals change color in changing environments. Seasonally: (many [[Arctic]] animals, such as the [[arctic fox]], or [[arctic hare]]).  Or quickly, like the [[chameleon]] and the [[cuttlefish]]. Some [[herd]] animals, like [[zebra]], have a pattern which makes it difficult for the predator when they are running. 
 
 [[Mimicry]] is a special kind of camouflage, where an animal or plant looks like another, usually one which is unpleasant to eat or dangerous. 
 
 === Countershading === 
 Most animals are dark on top and light underneath. With light coming from the sky, this ''countershading'' makes them less visible. < ref name=Cott/ >  That this is the correct explanation is proved by cases where the animal lives upside down. A famous example is the Nile catfish, which swims belly uppermost. In this case, the belly is dark, and the back is light in color. < ref name=Cott/ > < sup > p43 < /sup > 
 
 == Transparency and silvering == 
 [[Transparency|Transparent]] or partly transparent animals are common in the [[pelagic]] layer of the sea. < ref > McFall-Ngai, Margaret J. 1990. Crypsis in the pelagic environment. ''American Zoologist''. '''30''', 1 175–188. < /ref > < ref name=Sonke > Johnsen, Sönke 2001. Hidden in plain sight: the ecology and physiology of organismal transparency. ''Biological Bulletin'' '''201''', 3, 301–318. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1543609?uid=3738032 & uid=2 & uid=4 & sid=21101645983733] < /ref > < ref > Herring, Peter 2002. ''The biology of the deep ocean''. Oxford University Press, 190–195. {{ISBN|9780198549567}} < /ref > < ref > Ruxton G.D. Sherratt T.N. and Speed M.P. 2004. Chapter 4 Transparency and silvering, in ''Avoiding attack: the evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals  &  mimicry''. Oxford. < /ref >  These are the layers into which light penetrates. The effect of transparency or silvering works is better under water than above it. This is because the amount of light which penetrates is less and less as the depth increases. Also, the proportion of the light reflected is much less under water (0.001–0.6%) than in air (2–5%). < ref name=Sonke/ >
