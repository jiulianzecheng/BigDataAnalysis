 The  " hijab "  as a headscarf can come in several different types, such as an ordinary [[veil]] (which only covers the head), a [[niqab]], a [[Burqa|burka]] also known as an [[mwod:abaya|abayah]], which covers the entire body, and any form of covering used to veil. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Wear|first=Muslima|title=Muslima Hijabs|url=https://muslimawear.com/collections/hijabs|access-date=2021-12-02|website=Muslima Wear|language=en}} < /ref >  There are many styles to wear.
