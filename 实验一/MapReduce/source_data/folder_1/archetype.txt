 In [[psychology]], an '''archetype''' is a [[model]] of a [[person]], personality, or [[behavior]]. 
 
 In the analysis of personality, the term ''archetype'' is often broadly used to refer to 
 # a [[stereotype]]—personality type observed multiple times, especially an oversimplification of such a type; or 
 # an [[epitome]]—personality type exemplified, especially the  " greatest "  such example. 
 
 But in a strict linguistic sense, an archetype is merely a defining ''example'' of a personality type. In this sense  " mother figure "  can be considered an archetype and instances can be found in various female characters with distinct personalities. 
 
 Archetypes have been present in [[mythology]] and literature for hundreds of years. The use of archetypes to analyze personality was advanced by [[Carl Jung]] early in the [[20th century]]. The value in using archetypal characters in [[fiction]] derives from the fact that a large group of people are able to unconsciously recognize the archetype, and thus the motivations, behind the character's behavior.
