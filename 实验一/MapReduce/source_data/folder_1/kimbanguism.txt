 In April 1921, during the [[Belgian colonization in Congo]], Simon Kimbangu started preaching to people and using the powers that he believed he had received from God in visions to heal people. During his ministry, he attracted a large group of people. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=http://irr.org/african-indigenous-churches-chapter-fifteen|title=African Indigenous Churches — Chapter Fifteen|date=2011-05-11|website=Institute For Religious Research|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/j.ctt1wf4cr0.10|title=Kimbanguism|last1=GAMPIOT|first1=AURÉLIEN MOKOKO|last2=COQUET-MOKOKO|first2=CÉCILE|date=2017|publisher=Penn State University Press|isbn=9780271077550|series=An African Understanding of the Bible|pages=122–154|jstor=10.5325/j.ctt1wf4cr0.10}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1991/0328/28101.html|title=All-African Church|date=1991-03-28|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2019-10-31|issn=0882-7729}} < /ref >  Under pressure from the [[Catholic Church]], who was afraid of the popularity of the movement, the Belgian authorities tried to arrest Kimbangu on June 09, 1921. They failed in arresting him, and Kimbangu escaped. He continued his ministry in secret before turning himself in on September 12, 1921. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was changed to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1951. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Pemberton|first=Jeremy|date=1993|title=The History of Simon Kimbangu, Prophet, by the Writers Nfinangani and Nzungu, 1921: An Introduction and Annotated Translation|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1581107|journal=Journal of Religion in Africa|volume=23|issue=3|pages=194–231|doi=10.2307/1581107|jstor=1581107|issn=0022-4200}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|url=https://witness.worldpressphoto.org/kimbanguists-the-people-of-simon-cb0e2cb238fe|title=Kimbanguists|last=Waiswa|first=Sarah|date=2018-10-18|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}} < /ref >

 During Kimbangu’s imprisonment, Kimbanguism was prohibited, but the followers continued to practice it. It grew through the leadership of Kimbangu’s wife, Muile Marie, and his son, Joseph Diangenda. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  After Kimbangu’s death, the movement was recognized as a religion by the Belgian authorities in 1959  < ref name= " :0 "  / >  and became a member of the World Council of Churches in 1969. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/church-of-jesus-christ-on-earth-by-his-special-envoy-simon-kimbangu|title=Church of Jesus Christ on Earth by His Special Envoy Simon Kimbangu — World Council of Churches|website=www.oikoumene.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}} < /ref >  The church was led by Kimbangu’s youngest son, Joseph Diangenda Kuntima, until his death in 2001.

 According to  Kimbanguist rules, polygamy, smoking, drugs, alcohol, eating pork, sleeping naked, and trading on Sundays are all forbidden. During the Sunday services, believers do not wear shoes in the church. Green and white are the colors used in Kimbanguism. Green represents hope and white represents integrity. The churches are painted in these colors, and the believers wear them almost every day. The Kimbanguist has its headquarters in N'kamba, the hometown of Simon Kimbangu, which is considered “the [[New Jerusalem]].”  < ref name= " :3 "  / > < ref name= " :4 "  / > 
 
 == Organization == 
 Kimbanguism has expanded outside of the Congo. Some smaller communities are in other central African countries, as well as Belgium, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Pype|first=Katrien|date=2013-12-01|title=Les Kimbanguistes en France: Expression messianique d'une Église afro chrétienne en contexte migratoire|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00083968.2014.893959|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies / Revue canadienne des études africaines|volume=47|issue=3|pages=570–572|doi=10.1080/00083968.2014.893959|s2cid=143173331|issn=0008-3968}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.thekhw.co.uk/|title=The KHW - Home|website=www.thekhw.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.totalgiving.co.uk/charity/the-kimbanguist-hope-of-the-world|title=The Kimbanguist Hope Of The World - TotalGiving™ - Donate to Charity {{!}} Online Fundraising for Charity UK|website=www.totalgiving.co.uk|access-date=2019-10-31}} < /ref > 
 
 The spiritual leader is the supreme authority of the church. He is followed by the elders, who are the highest level of the Kimbanguist [[clergy]]. National and regional representatives make the second level of the leadership of the church. Decisions are made by the elders during meetings of representatives from the congregations. The Kimbanguist Church has its headquarters in N'kamba, the hometown of Simon Kimbangu, which is considered “the New Jerusalem.” Baptism is required to become a member of the church. < ref name= " :4 "  / >
