 '''''Adasaurus''''' is a [[Dromaeosaur]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. It lived in what is now [[Central Asia]]. It was a small carnivore, with a large, sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of each hind foot. An adult was probably about 6.2 feet (2 meters) long. < ref name=barsbold1983 > {{cite journal |first=Rinchen |last=Barsbold  |year=1983 |title=Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=19 |pages=5–119 |language=Russian}} < /ref > 
 
 Two specimens of ''Adasaurus'' have been found, both from the [[Gobi Desert]] of southern [[Mongolia]]. One is an incomplete skeleton with partial skull, including the vertebral column except the back of the tail, all three bones of the pelvis, the shoulder girdle and the hindlimbs. The second specimen includes the back end of another skeleton, including the hindlimbs. Both specimens are in the collection of the Mongolian Geological Institute in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia. 
 
 The age of the [[strata]], like most of Mongolia's later Cretaceous [[sediment]]s, is not known for certain. It is thought to be somewhere between 74 and 65 [[million]] years ago. Other dinosaurs found in this [[Geological formation|formation]] include ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'', ''[[Anserimimus]]'', and ''[[Saurolophus]]''.
