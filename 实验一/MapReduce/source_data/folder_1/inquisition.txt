 The '''Inquisition''' was the legal agent of the [[Catholic Church]] against [[heresy]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. It did two main things. First, it issued a list ([[the Index]]) of published books banned because they contained heresy. The faithful were forbidden to read such books. Second, it prosecuted individuals thought guilty of heresy. 
 
 Later versions of the Inquisitions had the power to use [[torture]] or the threat of torture to get [[wikt:confess|confessions]] and [[religious conversion]]s. It had the power to order [[execution]]s. The standard method was to burn heretics alive, or to [[garrotte|strangle]] them in public. The actual deed was done by the civil authorities. 
 
 The full name of the Inquisition was the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith ({{lang-la|Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide}}) of the Catholic Church. It developed in stages. The first permanent Inquisition was established in 1229. It was run by the [[Dominicans]] in [[Rome]]. < ref > Lea, Henry Charles 1888. Chapter VII. The Inquisition Founded. ''A History of the Inquisition In The Middle Ages'', 1. {{ISBN|1-152-29621-3}}. The judicial use of torture was as yet happily unknown... < /ref >  In 1478 [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] set up the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. 
 
 In 1542 [[Pope Paul III]] established the Congregation of the Holy Office of the Inquisition as a tribunal staffed with [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s and other officials. This version supervised the local Inquisitions in other countries, and also investigated important cases from Italy. The most famous case it tried was that of [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1633. 
 
 The word '''Inquisition''' comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''quaerere''. That means ''to turn'', ''to ask a question''.
