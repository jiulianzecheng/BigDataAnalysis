 '''Takeoff''' is the part of [[flight]] in which an [[aircraft]] goes from moving along the ground (taxiing) to flying in the air, usually on a [[runway]]. For [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[helicopter]]s and some special aircraft (such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]]), no runway is needed.  Takeoff is the opposite of [[landing]].
