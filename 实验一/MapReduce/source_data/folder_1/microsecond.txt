A '''microsecond''' (sometimes shortened to '''μs''') is one millionth of a [[second]]. This page lists times between '''10 < sup > −6 < /sup >  seconds''' (1 microsecond) and 10 < sup > −5 < /sup >  seconds (10 microseconds).  
 
 One microsecond contains 1000 [[nanosecond]]s. There are 1000 microseconds in one [[millisecond]]. 
 
 * 1 microsecond – the amount of time it takes for a high-speed [[camera]] flash to finish. 
 * 2 microseconds – the life time of a [[muonium]] particle 
 * 2.68 microseconds – the amount of time subtracted from the Earth [[Day]] as a result of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. 
 * 3.33564095 microseconds – the time it takes for [[light]] to travel one [[kilometer]] in a vacuum 
 * 5.4 microseconds – the time it takes for light to travel one [[mile]] in a [[vacuum]] 
 * 15 microseconds – the amount of time added to an Earth year by the [[Moon]] every year. 
 * 38 microseconds  -  difference in [[GPS]] [[satellite (artificial)|satellite]] time because of [[General relativity|relativity]] 
 * 240 microseconds (0.24 milliseconds)  -  [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of [[ununbium]] 277 
 * 45.9 microseconds - The time dilation of GPS satellites at 20,200 km for 24 hours.
