 ==Amides in inorganic chemistry== 
 An '''amide''' [[ion]] is different from an amide in organic chemistry. The amide ion is made by [[deprotonation|deprotonating]] [[ammonia]]. This is ammonia acting as an [[acid]], although a very weak one. Amides made by deprotonating ammonia are very strong [[base (chemistry)|bases]]. [[Sodium amide]] is an example.
