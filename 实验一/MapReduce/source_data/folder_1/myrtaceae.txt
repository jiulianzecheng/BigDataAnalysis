 The '''Myrtaceae''' or '''Myrtle family''' are a family of [[dicotyledon]] [[plant]]s, in the order [[Myrtales]]. [[Myrtle]], [[clove]], [[guava]], [[feijoa]], [[allspice]], and ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' belong here.  
 
 All species are woody, with [[essential oil]]s, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One character of the family is that the [[phloem]] is on both sides of the [[xylem]], not just outside as in most other plants. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[evergreen]], alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually with an entire (not toothed) margin. The [[flower]]s have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The [[stamen]]s are usually very conspicuous, brightly colored, and there are many of them.
