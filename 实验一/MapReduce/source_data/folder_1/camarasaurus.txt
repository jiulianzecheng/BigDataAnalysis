 '''''Camarasaurus''''' (meaning  " chambered lizard " ) was a large [[plant]]-[[eating]] [[sauropod]]. It was about 18 meters long and weighed about 18 metric tones. Its name comes from its skull, which is in the shape of an [[arch]]. It lived during the late [[Jurassic]], between 155 and 145 million years ago. These dinosaurs may have lived in herds. 
 
 It was first discovered in 1877 in [[Colorado]] by Oramel W. Lucas. Its fossil remains have been found in the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]]. 
 
 There are four species of Camarasaurus: 
 * ''C. grandis'' ( " grand chambered lizard " ) 
 * ''C. lentus'' 
 * ''C. lewisi'' 
 * ''C. supremus'' ( " biggest chambered lizard " ) 
 
 It was shown in the [[movie]] ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]''. 
 
 == Skull == 
 ''Camarasaurus'' is among the most common and frequently well-preserved sauropod dinosaurs. The maximum size of the most common species, ''C. lentus'', was about 15 & nbsp;meters (50 & nbsp;ft) in length. The largest species, ''C. supremus'', reached a maximum length of 23 & nbsp;meters (75 & nbsp;ft) and maximum estimated weight of 47 & nbsp;[[tonne]]s (51.8 & nbsp;[[short ton|tons]]). < ref name=Benton > Benton, Michael J. 2012.

 The arched [[skull]] of ''Camarasaurus'' was remarkably square and the blunt snout had many [[Fenestra (anatomy)|fenestrae]] (openings). It was sturdy and is often found in good condition by paleontologists. The 19 & nbsp;centimeter long (7.5 & nbsp;in) [[tooth|teeth]] were shaped like [[chisel]]s (spatulate) and arranged evenly along the jaw. The strength of the teeth indicates that ''Camarasaurus'' probably ate coarser plant material than the slender-toothed [[diplodocid]]s.

 There is a [[fossil record]] of two adults and a 12.2 & nbsp;meter (40 & nbsp;ft) long juvenile that died together in the late Jurassic leriod, about 150 million years ago (northeast [[Wyoming]]). It is assumed that their bodies were washed to their final resting place, in river [[mud]]. This suggests that ''Camarasaurus'' traveled in [[herd]]s or, at least, 'family' groups. Also, recovered camarasaur [[egg (biology)|eggs]] have been found in lines, rather than in neatly arranged [[nest]]s as with some other dinosaurs, which appears to suggest that, like most sauropods, ''Camarasaurus'' did not tend its young.
