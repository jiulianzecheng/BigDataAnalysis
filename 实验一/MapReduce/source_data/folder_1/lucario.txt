 ===Anime=== 
 Lucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pokémon movie, ''Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew''. In the movie, Lucario is a servant to Sir Aaron in a [[Renaissance]]-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to use aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's start, Lucario begins questioning any [[Pokémon]]-human relationship. The Lucario in the movie, can also speak human languages without psychic powers. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar. < ref name= " Lucario and the Mystery of Mew " > {{cite video |date=July 18, 1998 |title=[[Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]] |type=DVD |publisher=[[VIZ Media]]}} < /ref > < !-- This references the entire pharagraph -- >

 ==Reception== 
 UGO described Lucario as  " a new breed of Pokémon, with a cooler, more dangerous look. It's quick and possesses a damaging set of attacks " , yet called it lame due to its status as a Pokémon. < ref name= " UGO " > {{cite web| url = http://www.ugo.com/games/super-smash-bros-characters/?cur=lucario| title = Lucario - Smash Bros.
