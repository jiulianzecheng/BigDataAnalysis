 A '''suspect''' is a person believed to have done something wrong, committed a [[crime]] or caused something bad to happen. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/suspect|title=suspect, noun [C]|publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|access-date=2 August 2015}} < /ref >  In [[criminal law]] a person who is under suspicion or under [[Criminal investigation|investigation]] by [[law enforcement]] is considered a suspect. < ref name=USL > {{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/suspect/|title=Suspect Law  &  Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal.com|access-date=2 August 2015}} < /ref >  A '''prime suspect''' is believed by police to be the suspect who most probably committed a crime. < ref name=PS > {{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prime-suspect/|title=Prime Suspect Law  &  Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal.com|access-date=2 August 2015}} < /ref >  A formal suspect may be [[arrest]]ed when the [[fact]]s and circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe a suspect may have committed a crime or is about to. < ref name=USL/ >  In [[common law]] [[countries]] a suspect may have a [[defense attorney]] present while being questioned. < ref name=OConnor24 > Vivienne O’Connor, 'Common Law and Civil

 == Questioning a suspect == 
 === Common law countries === 
 In the past in common law countries, a suspect could not be questioned against their [[Free will|will]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], police can require suspects to be questioned. < ref name=Bell211 > John Bell, ''Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies, Vol 6, 2003-2004'' (Oxford: Hart Publishing Ltd, 2005), p. 211 < /ref >  Suspects are now required to listen to all questions, but may legally refuse to answer a question. < ref name=Bell211/ >  In the [[UK]] once a suspect has been formally charged, no questions may be asked. In [[France]], however, a suspect may still be questioned after being charged. The suspect may still legally refuse to answer any question. < ref name=Bell211/ >  In the [[United States]], once a suspect becomes the prime suspect, they must be advised of their [[Miranda v. Arizona|Miranda rights]] before they can be questioned. < ref name=PS/ >  Then they may be formally questioned, with a defence attorney present if the suspect requests one. < ref name=PS/ > 
 
 === Civil law countries === 
 In [[civil law]] countries a suspect may be questioned by police and the [[judiciary]]. This is to decide if there is enough [[evidence]] against a subject to bring the suspect to trial. < ref name=Maechling61 > Charles Maechling, Jr., 'Borrowing from Europe's Civil Law Tradition', ''ABA Journal'', Vol 77 (January 1991), p. 61 < /ref >  There are three phases to the investigation. The first phase is a suspect is questioned by police. In the second phase the suspect is questioned by a [[magistrate]] (called a ''juge d'instruction'' in [[France]]). < ref name=Maechling61/ >  The third phase is the trial conducted by a state [[prosecutor]] in front of a panel of [[judge]]s or magistrates. < ref name=Maechling61/ >  Then, if the investigation trial shows a case is strong enough, it is brought before a [[tribunal]] for trial. < ref name=Maechling61/ > 
 
 == Terms confused with suspect == 
 === Person of interest === 
 A person of interest is a non-legal term for someone police may be interested in. In some cases a person of interest may simply be someone who has information related to an investigation or could be a [[witness]]. < ref name= " CNNPOI " > {{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Stephanie|title=What does 'person of interest' mean? Nothing|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/17/yale.person.of.interest/index.html|access-date=20 July 2017|agency=CNN|date=17 September 2009}} < /ref >  Police may be suspicious of someone, but do not have enough evidence to justify calling them a suspect. < ref name= " CNNPOI " / >  Sometimes police also misuse the term 'person of interest' to mean the suspect. < ref name= " eInvest " > {{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Donna|title=Dilemma of Interest|url=http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=4042|website=AJR|publisher=Philip Merrill College of Journalism|access-date=20 July 2017|date=February 2006}} < /ref >  Another use of the term is by [[writer]]s meaning simply an interesting [[person]].

 === Perpetrator === 
 Police and reporters sometimes misuse the term suspect to mean the perpetrator. A suspect is someone ''suspected'' of committing a crime. A perpetrator (slang ''perp'') is a person who actually committed a crime. < ref name=eInvest/ >  Good police work will eliminate suspects until they find the perpetrator (also called a culprit). < ref name=PowellLOND > {{cite web|url=http://www.thelondoner.ca/2011/05/17/the-difference-between-a-suspect-and-culprit|title=The difference between a suspect and culprit|author=Clay Powell|date=17 May 2011|publisher=The Londoner|access-date=2 August 2015|archive-date=5 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172038/http://www.thelondoner.ca/2011/05/17/the-difference-between-a-suspect-and-culprit|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 In the US and [[England]], police have broad powers to arrest and detain suspects. In [[Canada]] police supposedly do not have that power. < ref name=PowellLOND/ >  In a crime that gets a lot of [[wikt:publicity|publicity]], police will sometimes detain a suspect for a period of time, then release them with no charges filed. < ref name=PowellLOND/ >  Somehow the news media is informed of the release and a swarm of [[reporter]]s and [[paparazzi]] are there to take pictures for next day's tabloids. < ref name=PowellLOND/ >  Generally this is for a day or two in England. < ref name=PowellLOND/ >  In the US it can be up to 72 hours. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-rights/how-long-may-police-hold-suspects-before-charges-must-be-filed.html |title=How Long May Police Hold Suspects Before Charges Must be Filed?|publisher=FindLaw/Thomson Reuters|access-date=2 August 2015}} < /ref >  This process encourages the public to think of suspects as [[guilt]]y, trusting the police would not arrest innocent people. < ref name=Levesque3.4 > Roger J. R. Levesque, ''The Psychology and Law of Criminal Justice Processes'' (New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2005), pp. 3–4 < /ref >  This is sometimes called  " rounding up the usual suspects " . < ref name=Levesque3.4/ >  Sometimes police will call a suspect a perpetrator or person of interest and question them without giving a Miranda warning. < ref name=AJC > {{cite web |url=http://www.americanjusticecenter.com/law/faq/ca-criminal-procedure-flow-chart/police/ |title=Role of the Police |publisher=American Justice Center |access-date=2 August 2015 |archive-date=22 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422012236/http://www.americanjusticecenter.com/law/faq/ca-criminal-procedure-flow-chart/police/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This is a [[wikt:technicality|technicality]] since in the US police are required to give a Miranda warning if arresting a suspect. If after arresting and then questioning a suspect, police may decide they have the perpetrator. Then they will hand the case over to the [[district attorney]]. < ref name=AJC/ >
