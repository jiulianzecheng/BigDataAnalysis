 '''''Brachiosaurus''''' (meaning  " ''[[Arm]] [[lizard]]'' " ) was a [[herbivorous]] [[dinosaur]] genus that lived in the [[Upper Jurassic]] period. The name comes from the fact that the Brachiosaur's front [[leg]]s were longer than its back legs. Most other dinosaurs had back legs that were longer than their front legs or arms. ''Brachiosaurus'' was about 25 m (82 feet) long and 13 meters (42 feet) tall. It was one of the biggest dinosaurs. 
 
 Brachiosaurus was a [[sauropod]]. Its [[fossil]]s were found in [[North America]] and [[Asia]]. At full stretch, Brachiosaurus could reach heights of up to 16 meters (52 feet). The ''Brachiosaurus'' [[skeleton]] in the [[Humboldt Museum]] in [[Berlin, Germany]] is both the tallest and largest complete sauropod skeleton. This means that it is also the tallest and largest complete dinosaur skeleton.
