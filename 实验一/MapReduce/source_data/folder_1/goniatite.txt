 '''Goniatites''' are a type of [[ammonite]]. They are [[cephalopods]] from the Order Goniatitida. They evolved from earlier forms in the Middle [[Devonian]] some 390 million years ago. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Devonian-Period|title=Devonian Period {{!}} geochronology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 All goniatites had an external shell like other ammonites. It was divided internally into chambers filled with gas, giving it [[buoyancy]]. An open chamber at the front of the shell was where the animal lived. It drew in and expelled water through a ventral spout called a [[siphuncle]]. They had a head with two well developed eyes, and arms (or [[tentacles]]). They were free-swimming.  
 
 Almost any fossil-bearing [[limestone]] or [[shale]] from [[inland sea]]s of the late [[Paleozoic]] [[tropics]] or [[subtropics]] is likely to contain some goniatites. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/ammonoid|title=ammonoid {{!}} fossil cephalopod|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}} < /ref >
