'''Multilingualism''' is the ability to speak more than one [[language]]. The ability to speak two languages is  " bilingualism, "  a type of multilingualism. Many [[Immigration|immigrants]] are bilingual and speak languages of both their old and their new country. Multilingualism is useful in many kinds of work, partly because [[international trade]] is more common than in past centuries. Some countries and organizations having more than one [[official language]] hire people who speak more than one, so they can work with more people.  
 
 Most people have a [[first language]] that they learned as [[babies]]. Other languages are usually learned much later. 
 
 People who learn many languages can find it easier to learn more languages if the new language is like the ones they already know. But sometimes, learning a new language can be hard if the person remembers old languages they learned before. < ref > {{cite web|last=Pavlenko|first=Aneta|date=2 June 2015|title=Can a second language help you learn a third?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-bilingual/201506/can-second-language-help-you-learn-third|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230426210029/https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/life-bilingual/201506/can-second-language-help-you-learn-third|archive-date=26 April 2023|access-date=7 September 2016|website=Psychology Today: Life as a Bilingual}} < /ref >  Sometimes, learning a second language can make it hard to remember words. < ref name= " eb1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Bylund|first1=Emanuel|last2=Antfolk|first2=Jan|last3=Abrahamsson|first3=Niclas|last4=Olstad|first4=Anne Marte Haug|last5=Norrman|first5=Gunnar|last6=Lehtonen|first6=Minna|date=2023-06-01|title=Does bilingualism come with linguistic costs?

 Some linguists think there are more multilingual people in the world than monolingual people, who speak only one language < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://ilanguages.org/bilingual.php|title=Multilingual People - Are you a polyglot?|website=ilanguages.org|access-date=2018-04-23}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251929789|title=A Global Perspective on Bilingualism|last=Tucker|first=G.

 People who can speak several languages are called  " polyglots " . Those who can speak many, such as  [[Heinrich Schliemann]] and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], are called  " hyperpolyglots " . < ref > [http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/30/are-you-a-hyperpolyglot-the-secrets-of-language-superlearners/ Are You a Hyperpolyglot?

 As a result of wars, boundaries change. That may put some people in a country which uses a different language from theirs. For example, as a result of being in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. [[Hungary]] was on the losing side of [[World War I|WWI]]. Much of the eastern part of their country was given to [[Romania]] after the war. Hungarian is not just a different language, it is in a completely different language category from most other European languages.
