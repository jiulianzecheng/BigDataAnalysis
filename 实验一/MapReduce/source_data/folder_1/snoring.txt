'''Snoring''' during [[sleep]] is caused by vibration. The parts which vibrate are at the back of the nose and throat. They may partly block the passage of air, so causing the characteristic rumbling sound. 
 
 Snoring can be a problem, and tends to get worse with age. Best to sleep on one's side, which reduces snoring.
