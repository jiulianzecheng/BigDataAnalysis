Other settlements in the parish include the villages of '''Ashton''', '''Carleen''', Godolphin Cross, and the coastal village of Praa Sands.

 ==Geography== 
 The geological formation known as the Tregonning-Godolphin Granite underlies the parish and the area was formerly an important source of tin and copper ore. Other than Praa Sands, the villages in the parish were tin and copper mining villages. Most of today's working population are commuters, travelling to nearby towns or to RNAS Culdrose. 
 
 ==Parish Church== 
 The church was built of granite in the 15th century: on the north wall are five medieval wall paintings. A Roman milestone of the 3rd century is preserved in the church and in the churchyard there is an unusual Hiberno-Saxon cross head. < ref > Pevsner, N.
