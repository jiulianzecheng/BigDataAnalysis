 '''Dice''' are [[wikt:object|objects]] used in [[game]]s when something [[random]] needs to be done, such as moving a game piece a random number of places on a board. Most dice are [[cube]]s that have the [[number]]s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the faces. Dice are sometimes made in other [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] shapes than cubes, but the six-sided die (''die'' is the singular of  " dice " ) is the most common. A die is usually rolled by the playerâ€™s hand. When adding together opposite sides of typical cubical dice, the sum is always 7. 
 
 Some games are played with two or more dice and some use only one. Some games that use dice are [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], [[Yahtzee]], [[Risk (game)|Risk]], and many more. 
 
 Weights can be put inside a die to make it only land on a certain number once it is rolled. This is sometimes used as a way of [[cheating]]. 
 
 == Types of dice ==

 There are many different types of dice. Some dice have different numbers of sides. These are called polyhedral dice. They are used in some games like [[Dungeons  &  Dragons]].

 Some dice do not have numbers on them at all. Instead, they have [[letter]]s, pictures, or other [[symbol]]s on them. Some games use these when they need something random that is not a number. For example, some [[word game]]s use dice with letters to give the players random letters they have to use in the game.
