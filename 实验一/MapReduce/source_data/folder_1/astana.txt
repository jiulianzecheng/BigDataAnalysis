 '''Astana''' ({{IPA-all|ɑstɑnɑ|Kazakh:|3=Kk-astana.ogg}}, {{lang-kk|Астана}}), previously known as '''Akmolinsk''' (Russian: Акмолинск, romanized: Akmolinsk), '''Tselinograd''', and '''Nur-Sultan''', is the [[capital city]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. 
 
 Astana has an estimated population of 1,184,469. < ref name= " 2021pop " > {{cite web | url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/kazakhstan/admin/ | title=Kazakhstan: Administrative Division (Regions and Districts) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map }} < /ref >  It has been the capital of [[Kazakhstan]] since 1998. The name  " Astana " , which in [[Kazakh]] language means  " Capital city " , was chosen because it is easily pronounced in many languages. In Kazakh, it is pronounced  " As-ta-'''na''' " , while in [[English language|English]] (and, for instance, [[German language|German]]), common pronunciation is  " As-'''ta'''-na " . It is in the [[Aqmola Province]]. 
 
 On 23 March 2019, a unanimous vote in Kazakhstan's parliament agreed to the new name. The city was renamed Nur-Sultan, after former president [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/it-s-official-kazakh-capital-now-called-nur-sultan/29837884.html|title=It's official: Kazakh capital now called Nur-Sultan|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}} < /ref >  The name was changed back to Astana in September 2022. < ref name= " guardian2022 " > {{cite news |title=Kazakhstan to change name of capital from Nur-sultan back to Astana |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/14/kazakhstan-to-change-name-of-capital-from-nur-sultan-back-to-astana |accessdate=14 September 2022 |work=the Guardian |agency=The Guardian |date=14 September 2022 |language=en}} < /ref >
