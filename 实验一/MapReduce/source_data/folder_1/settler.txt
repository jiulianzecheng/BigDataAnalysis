 A '''settler''' is a person who has [[human migration|migrated]] to an area and made a permanent home there.  Many times the reason is to [[colony|colonize]] the area. 
 
 Many times in history settlers live on land which used to belong to people who had lived there a long time.  These people are known as [[indigenous people]].  Other names are [[native]]s, [[Aborigines]] or, in the [[Americas]], [[Native American|Indians]]. This land is usually settled against the wishes of the indigenes. It is then controlled, defended and grown by force.
