 '''Glastonbury''' is a [[town]] in [[Somerset]], England. It is well known for being mistakenly thought of where [[Glastonbury Festival]] is held, however the festival is in fact held in the village of Pilton, nearly 7 miles to the east. 
 
 ==History== 
 Glastonbury is also well known because of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]. This is because Glastonbury Abbey is said to be the place where [[King Arthur]] is buried, and it was burned down when King Henry the Eighth got angry at all Catholic monasteries in the country as the [[Pope]] would not grant him a divorce. The abbot, Abbot Whiting, was killed on the Tor, a local landmark.
