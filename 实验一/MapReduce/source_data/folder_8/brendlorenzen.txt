 '''Brendlorenzen''' is a suburb of the town of [[Bad Neustadt an der Saale]] in [[Lower Franconia]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany.  The village is extending along a single main street for more than two kilometers. Its length is due to the growing together of originally two separate villages called Brend and Lorenzen.
