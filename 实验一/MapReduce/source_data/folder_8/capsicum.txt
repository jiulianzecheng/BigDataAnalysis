 '''''Capsicum''''' is a [[genus]] of [[plant]]s from the nightshade family ([[Solanaceae]]).  
 
 Some of these plants are used as [[spice]]s, [[vegetable]]s, or [[drug]]s. The [[fruit]] of ''Capsicum'' plants have a variety of names. They are often called [[Chili pepper]], red or green pepper, or just pepper in [[British English|Britain]] and [[American English|the US]].  
 
 The large mild form is called ''bell pepper'' in [[British English]] and the US, ''capsicum'' in [[New Zealand English]], [[Australian English]] and ''[[paprika]]'' in some other countries (although ''paprika'' can also refer to the powdered spice made from various capsicum fruit). 
 
 Capsicums originated in [[the Americas]], but are now grown worldwide. 
 
 == Capsaicin == 
 The fruit of ''most'' species of ''Capsicum'' contains [[capsaicin]]. It is a [[defence against herbivory]]. Capsaicin is a [[chemical substance|chemical]] that can produce a strong burning sensation in the mouth (and [[anus]]) of the unaccustomed eater. Most [[mammal]]s find this unpleasant, but birds are unaffected. < ref > Mason J.R. ''et al'' 1991. ''Journal of Chemical Ecology''. '''17''', 2539–2551. < /ref > < ref > Norman D.M; Mason J.R.  &  Clark L. 1992. ''The Wilson Journal of Ornithology'' '''104''', 549–551. < /ref >   The plants developed the secretion of capsaicin to protect the fruit from being eaten by [[mammal]]s. At the same time, the bright colors attract [[bird]]s. These birds will spread the [[seed]]s.  
 
 The amount of capsaicin in peppers is highly variable and dependent on [[genetics]]. This means that  almost all types of peppers have varied amounts of heat felt by those consuming them.  The only pepper without capsaicin is the [[bell pepper]]. [[Chili pepper]]s are of great importance in [[Native American]] medicine.  Capsaicin is also used in modern Western medicine to stimulate [[blood circulation]] or to relieve [[pain]]. 
 
 [[Black pepper]] and [[Sichuan pepper]] cause similar burning sensations. These are caused by different substances though —piperine and hydroxy-alpha-sanshool, respectively. 
 
 == Cuisine == 
 [[File:Cubanelle Peppers.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Chili pepper]]s]] 
 
 ''Capsicum'' fruits and peppers can be eaten raw or cooked. Those used in cooking are generally varieties of the ''C. annul'' and ''C. pubescens'' species, though a few others are used as well. They are suitable for stuffing with fillings such as cheese, meat or rice. 
 
 They are also frequently used both chopped and raw in salads, or cooked in stir-fries or other mixed dishes. They can be sliced into strips and fried, roasted whole or in pieces, or chopped and incorporated into salsas or other sauces. 
 
 They can be preserved by drying or pickling. Dried peppers may be reconstituted whole, or processed into flakes or powders. Pickled or marinated peppers are frequently added to sandwiches or salads. Extracts can be made and incorporated into hot sauces. 
 
 In 2005, a poll of 2,000 people revealed peppers to be [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] 4th favorite culinary vegetable. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/britain/article/0,2763,1489887,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 May 2005|title=Onions come top for British palates|accessdate=2013-06-01 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Wainwright}} < /ref > 
 
 == Varieties == 
 [[File:Capsicum1.jpg|thumb|200px|Green, yellow and red peppers]] 
 Many varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways; for example, ''C. annual'' includes the  " bell pepper "  variety, which is sold in both its immature green state and its red, yellow or orange ripe state. 
 
 This same species has other varieties as well, such as the Anaheim chilly often used for stuffing, the dried Ancho chilly used to make chili powder, the mild-to-hot [[Jalapeño]], and the smoked ripe Jalapeño, known as a [[Chipotle]]. 
 
 Most of the capsaicin in a pepper is found in the interior ribs that divide the chambers of the fruit, and to which the seeds are attached. At the stem end of the pod, glands secrete the capsaicin, which then spreads throughout, but is concentrated on the ribs and seeds. The amount varies very significantly by variety, and is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU), ranging from the mild bell pepper to the scorching [[Habanero chili|Habanero chile]]. 
 
 == Synonyms and common names == 
 [[File:Compact orange pepper plants.jpg|thumb|200px|Compact orange Capsicum plants]] 
 
 The name given to the fruits varies between English-speaking countries. 
 
 In [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]], heatless species are called  " capsicums "  while hot ones are called  " chilli/chillies "  (double L). The term  " bell peppers "  is rarely used, usually in reference to C. annuum and other varieties which look like a  " capsicum "  or bell but are fairly hot. 
 
 In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Canada]], the heatless varieties are called  " peppers " ,  " sweet peppers "  or  " capsicums "  (or  " green peppers, "   " red peppers, "  etc.) while the hot ones are  " chilli/chillies "  (double L) or  " chilli peppers " . 
 
 In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the common heatless species is referred to as  " bell peppers, "   " sweet peppers, "   " red/green/etc peppers, "  or simply  " peppers " , while the hot species are collectively called  " chile/chiles, "   " chili/chilies, "  or  " chili/chile peppers "  (one L only),  " hot peppers " , or named as a specific variety (e.g., banana pepper). In many [[midwest]]ern regions of the United States the sweet bell pepper is commonly called a [[mango]].[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/mango]  With the modern advent of fresh tropical fruit importers exposing more people to the tropical fruit variety of the mango, this definition is becoming archaic.  However many menus still call a stuffed bell pepper a ''mango''. 
 
 The name  " pepper "  came into use because the plants were hot in the same sense as the condiment [[black pepper]], ''Piper nigrum''. But there is no botanical relationship with this plant, nor with [[Sichuan pepper|sichuan pepper]].

 In Spanish-speaking countries there are many different names for each variety and preparation. In [[Mexico]] the term ''chile'' is used. Several other countries, such as [[Chile]], whose name is unrelated, [[Perú]], and [[Argentina]], use ''ají''. In [[Spain]], heatless varieties are called ''pimiento'' and hot varieties ''guindilla''. 
 
 In Indian English, the word  " capsicum "  is used exclusively for bell pepper. All other varieties of chili peppers are called chili. In northern [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], bell pepper is also commonly called  " shimla mirch "  in the native languages. [[Shimla]] is a popular hill-station in India (and  " mirch "  means chili in native languages). 
 
 In [[Polish language|Polish]], the word ''papryka'' is used for capsiscum fruit and dry spice (the word ''pieprz'' is used for black, red, and green pepper, but not for capsisum fruit or spice). 
 
 In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the word ''paprika'' is used for capsicum fruit and dry spice. 
 
 In [[Israel]] capsicum is commonly called ''pilpel'', meaning pepper in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. 
 
 You can test how hot a hot pepper can be by using the Scoville scale. 
 
 == Medical use == 
 Capsicum is excellent source of [[laxative]] (purgative) and pain relief.  Capsaicin has also been studied for possible [[prostate cancer]] fighting effects. < ref > {{cite web|title=Chili Peppers and Prostate Cancer|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/493517-chili-peppers-and-prostate-cancer/|publisher=Livestrong.com website|accessdate=8 April 2014|author=Emma Cale|date= 2013}} < /ref >
