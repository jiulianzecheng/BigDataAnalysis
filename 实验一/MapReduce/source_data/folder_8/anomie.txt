'''Anomie''' means the absence of the usual moral or ethical [[value]]s, where a person or group lacks ethical standards. < ref > Concise OED p51. < /ref >  In the context of [[society]] or [[government]] it may be a cause of social unrest. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 The word comes from [[Greek language|Greek]], namely the [[prefix]]  ''a-'' “without”, and ''nomos'' “law”. The original meaning of ''anomie'' was  " against or outside the law " .  
 
 In contemporary English the word ''anomie'' can mean not only [[normlessness]] but also [[Anarchism|anarchy]]. [[Émile Durkheim]] and later theorists, meant with ''anomie'' a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory [[social control]]s of [[society]], and is a completely separate concept from anarchy which is an absence of effective rulers or leaders. 
 
 == Anomie in literature and film == 
 In [[Albert Camus]]’s [[existentialism|existentialist]] [[novel]] ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'', the protagonist [[Meursault]] struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old. He exists largely in a state of ''anomie'', as seen from the apathy evinced in the opening lines: ''“Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas”'' (“Today Mother died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know.”)  
 
 [[Dostoevsky]], whose work is often considered a philosophical precursor to [[existentialism]], often expressed a similar concern in his novels. In ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', the character Dimitri Karamazov asks his [[atheist]] friend Rakitin, ”...without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?” [[Raskolnikov]], the anti-hero of Dostoevsky’s novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', puts this philosophy into action when he kills an elderly pawnbroker and her sister, later rationalizing this act to himself with the words, “...it wasn’t a human being I killed, it was a principle!” 
 
 On [[Hermann Hesse]]´s ''[[Der Steppenwolf]]'' we can also find a very clear picture of anomie. The protagonist affirms that the men of the [[Dark Ages]] did not suffer more than those of the [[Classical Antiquity]], and vice-versa. It is rather those who live between two times, those who do not know what to follow, that suffer the most. In this token, a man from the Dark Ages living in the Classical Antiquity, or the opposite, would undergo a gulping sadness and [[agony]].
