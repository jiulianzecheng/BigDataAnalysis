 '''Envelopment''' is the military [[wikt:tactic|tactic]] of attacking the [[enemy]]'s [[wikt:flank|flank]] or [[wikt:rear|rear]]. < ref name=goodbad > {{cite web |url=http://goodbadstrategy.com/wp-content/downloads/FM100-5_Envelopment.pdf |title=Forms of Maneuver |website=FM 100-5 Operations, US Department of the Army |publisher=Good Strategy Bad Strategy |access-date=23 August 2016 |archive-date=10 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010190811/http://goodbadstrategy.com/wp-content/downloads/FM100-5_Envelopment.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This is done while keeping the enemy's attention [[wikt:focus|focus]]ed on his front by the use of [[wikt:diversion|diversion]]ary attacks. < ref name=goodbad/ >  The envelopment makes the enemy fight in a direction they are the least prepared for. < ref name=globalsecurity > {{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/5-71-2/chap3.htm |title=Offensive Operations |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |access-date=23 August 2016}} < /ref >  The maneuver requires a flank that can be attacked. Unlike a [[flanking maneuver]], which uses the enemy's forward movement to create an attackable flank, envelopment depends on the enemy's [[Defense (military)|defensive position]], any [[wikt:obstacle|obstacle]]s and the [[terrain]]. < ref name=globalsecurity/ >  The envelopment has both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include being able to capture or defeat all or part of an opposing army. < ref name=tacticstut > {{cite web |url=http://www.theartofbattle.com/tactics-tutorial/ |title=Tactics Tutorial |publisher=Palmer History Group |access-date=23 August 2016}} < /ref >  It offers less risk than other offensive maneuvers. < ref name=tacticstut/ >  Disadvantages include the possibility of an enemy [[counterattack]] on the weakened center or on the other flank. < ref name=tacticstut/ > 
 
 == Types of envelopment == 
 * '''[[Turning movement]]''' where the object is to  " turn "  the enemy from his defensive position and force them to act. < ref name=goodbad/ > 
 * '''Single envelopment''' is an attack on one flank or the enemy rear from one direction while holding their attention to their front. < ref name=Bellanger6 > Yves J. Bellanger, ''U. S. Army Armored Division 1943-1945'' (Raleigh, NC: Lulu Publishing, 2010), p. 6 < /ref > 
 * '''[[Double envelopment]]''', also called a Pincer movement, requires three forces. One holds the center while the other two attack the right and left flanks. < ref name=Bellanger6/ >  Once both flanking attacks reach the rear, the enemy is encircled.    
 * '''[[:en:Air_assault|Vertical envelopment]]''' is an envelopment from the sky. < ref name=McGowen6 > Tom McGowen, ''Assault from the Sky: Airborne Infantry of World War II'' (Brookfield, CT: Twenty-First Century Books, 2002) , pp. 6â€“12 < /ref >  First thought of by [[Benjamin Franklin]], it was not practical until the invention of the [[airplane]]. < ref name=McGowen6/ >   Vertical envelopment uses paratroopers or other soldiers that arrive by air on the enemy's flank or rear. < ref name=McGowen6/ > 
 
 == Historic examples == 
 Famous [[example]]s of the single envelopment include [[Alexander the Great]] who used it at the [[:en:Battle_of_Gaugamela|Battle of Gaugamela]] in [[331 BC]]. < ref name=Phifer3 > Michiko Phifer, ''A Handbook of Military Strategy and Tactics'' (New Delhi: Vij Books India Private Limited, 2012), p. 3 < /ref >  [[Robert E. Lee]] used the tactic at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863. < ref name=Phifer3/ >  During [[World War II]], German General [[Erwin Rommel]] used it successfully at the [[Battle of Gazala]], which led directly to his [[Siege of Tobruk|capture of Tobruk]] in 1941. < ref name=Phifer3/ >  Some of the famous double envelopments include [[Hannibal]] at the [[Battle of Cannae]] where he defeated the [[Roman Republic|Roman army]] in [[:en:216_BC|216 BC]]. < ref name=Phifer3/ >  In 1781 during the [[American Revolutionary War]], American [[general]] [[:en:Daniel_Morgan|Daniel Morgan]] used it successfully against British general [[:en:Banastre_Tarleton|Banastre Tarleton]], causing many of the British [[soldier]]s to [[surrender (military)|surrender]]. < ref name=Phifer3/ >   In the 1944 [[:en:Falaise_Pocket|Falaise Gap]] during [[Operation Overlord]], German troops were caught in a double envelopment by [[British Army|British]] and [[United States Army|American forces]]. < ref name=Phifer3/ >
