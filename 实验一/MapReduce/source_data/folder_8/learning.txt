'''Learning''' is getting new things into your [[brain]].  
 
 There are a number of different types of learning:  < ref > Hilgard E.H.  &  Bower G.D. 1981. ''Theories of learning''. 5th ed, Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York. < /ref > 
 #[[Classical conditioning]]: where two stimuli come together, the organism learns they are related. 
 #[[Operant conditioning]]: an organism changes its behaviour when behaviour has [[wikt:consequence|consequences]]. 
 #[[Play (activity)|Play]]: an [[heritable|inherited]] mechanism whereby [[mammal]]s speed up learning in the young. 
 #[[Gestalt]] learning: learning by [[insight]] 
 #[[wikt:Imitation|Imitation]], emulation or observational learning: mimicking the behaviour of others 
 #[[Implicit learning]] or [[Unconscious mind|unconscious learning]]: learning which is done without conscious awareness of the learning process. 
 #[[Imprinting]]: a very rapid type of early learning. 
 Learning may occur as a result of [[habituation]] or [[classical conditioning]], seen in many animal species, or as a result of more complex activities such as [[play (activity)|play]], seen only in relatively intelligent animals. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm |title=Jungle gyms: the evolution of animal play |access-date=2012-03-26 |archive-date=2007-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011051238/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php What behavior can we expect of octopuses?] < /ref >  Learning may occur [[conscious]]ly or without conscious awareness. There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which [[habituation]] has been observed as early as 32 weeks into [[gestation]], indicating that the [[central nervous system]] is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early in [[developmental psychology|development]]. < ref > Sandman, Wadhwa, Hetrick, Porto  &  Peeke. (1997). Human fetal heart rate dishabituation between thirty and thirty-two weeks gestation. Child Development, 68, 1031–1040. < /ref >  According to James Zull, Professor of Biology and Biochemistry at Case Western University,  " Learn­ing is phys­i­cal. Learn­ing means the mod­i­fi­ca­tion, growth, and prun­ing of our neu­rons, connections{{mdash}}called synapses{{mdash}}and neu­ronal net­works, through expe­ri­ence " .
