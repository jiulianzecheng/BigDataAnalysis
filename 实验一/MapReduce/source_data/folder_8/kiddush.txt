 '''Kiddush ({{lang|he|קִדּוּשׁ}})''' is a [[blessing]] said by [[Judaism|Jews]] at the start of [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays|holiday]] meals.  The term is also used to refer to a light meal served in the [[synagogue]] after the long Shabbat and holiday morning [[prayer]]s.  The word comes from a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[wikt:root#noun|root]] meaning  " [[holy]] " . 
 
 ==Kiddush at the evening Shabbat meal== 
 There are two [[wikt:version|versions]] of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Bible]]. These versions use different words.  The version in [[Exodus]] < ref > {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:7|HE}} < /ref >  says  " '''Remember''' Shabbat to keep it [[wikt:holy|holy]]. "   The version in [[Deuteronomy]] < ref > {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:11|HE}} < /ref >  says  " '''[[wikt:guard#Verb|Guard]]''' Shabbat to keep it holy. "   Jewish [[custom]] says that  " remember "  means to ''[[wikt:celebrate|celebrate]]'' Shabbat.   " Guard "  means ''resting''—not working or doing [[business]]. < ref name=jewfaq > {{cite web|title=Shabbat|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/shabbat.htm|publisher=Judaism 101|access-date=7 March 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 There are many things Jews do to celebrate Shabbat [see [[Shabbat#Celebrating Shabbat|Shabbat (Celebrating Shabbat)]]].  The [[wikt:minimum|minimum]] way to celebrate is to say the [[blessing]]  " Blessed are You, God, Who makes Shabbat holy. "   The [[Talmud]] adds that the blessing should be said with a cup of [[wine]]. This is because wine makes people feel happy. < ref > {{cite web|last=Riskin|first=Rabbi Shlomo|title=Q & A with Rabbi Riskin|url=http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/features/q & a99.htm|work=Ohr Torah Stone online|publisher=Ohr Torah Stone|access-date=June 13, 2013|archive-date=September 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926201528/http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/features/q%26a99.htm|url-status=dead}}. < /ref >   Because of this, the Friday evening meal in a Jewish home starts with a [[wikt:ceremony|ceremony]] to say this blessing over a cup of wine. 
 
 ===Text=== 
 In [[wikt:traditional|traditional]] homes, the blessing is said in the [[Hebrew language]].  This is a Simple English translation of the blessing. < ref > Based on [[Ashkenazi]] version, though others are not very different. See, for example: {{cite book |first=Lord Jonathan |last=Sacks |title=The Koren Siddur |edition=Nusaḥ Ashkenaz, 1st Hebrew/English |date=2009 |publisher=Koren Publishers |location=Jerusalem |isbn=978-9-653-01067-3 }} ('' " Koren Sacks Siddur " ''), pp. 382-3. The Hebrew text is also available freely on English Wikipedia at [[:en:Kiddush#Hebrew text of Friday night kiddush|Kiddush (Hebrew text of Friday night Kiddush)]]. < /ref >  Words in italics ''like this'' are added to explain the Hebrew. 
 
 {{divbox|blue||It was evening, and then morning, on the sixth day ''of the creation of the [[universe]]''.  Heaven and earth and all that filled them were complete.  On the seventh day, God finished all his work. He rested on the seventh day from all his work.  God blessed the seventh day and made it a holy day because that day he stopped all the work of [[wikt:creation|creation]]. < ref > This paragraph is from {{bibleref|Genesis|1:31-2:3|HE}}. < /ref >

 You are blessed, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who made us holy with His [[wikt:command|commandments]]. God wanted for us ''to have the holy Shabbat.''  With love and desire God gave us His holy Shabbat. ''Shabbat helps us'' remember the Creation of the universe. It is the first among the holidays. ''It helps us'' remember when we left [[Egypt]]. You chose us and made us holy among all nations, and with love and desire You gave us Your Holy Shabbat. 
 
 Blessed are You, God, Who made the Shabbat holy. (All answer: Amen.)}} 
 
 ==Kiddush at the morning (or noon) Shabbat meal== 
 There is a different version of Kiddush for the Shabbat morning (or [[noon]]) meal.  This ceremony makes the meal feel more special.   
 
 For the morning Kiddush, a person says [[verse]]s from the [[Torah]] about Shabbat. These verses are usually from {{bibleref|Exodus|31:16-17|HE}} and {{bibleref|Exodus|20:7-10|HE}}.  The person ends with the same blessing over the wine: < ref > ''Koren Sacks Siddur'' (see above), pp. 580-1. < /ref > 
 {{divbox|blue||You are blessed, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Creator of the [[fruit]] of the [[grape]]vine. (All answer:Amen.)}} 
 
 ===Kiddush at the third Shabbat meal=== 
 Most Jews do not say Kiddush at the [[third Shabbat meal]]. < ref > {{cite book|last=Sperber|first=Daniel|title=Why Jews Do What They Do: The history of Jewish customs throughout the cycle of the Jewish year|year=1999|publisher=KTAV Publishing House|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0-88125-604-8|pages=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjHdj_3oYkQC & dq=rambam+kiddush+third+meal & pg=PA45|translator=Yaakov Elman}} < /ref >    However, [[Maimonides]] ruled that they should do so. < ref > See ''Mishneh Torah Hilchot Shabbat'' 30:9. < /ref >  The text for this Kiddush includes {{bibleref|Exodus|16:25|HE}}.  That verse is the source of the [[law]] to have three meals on Shabbat. 
 
 ==Kiddush in the synagogue== 
 Kiddush is also said in the synagogue.  This does not replace saying Kiddush at home before the meal. < ref name=KSS / > 
 *'''Evening Kiddush.''' In many synagogues, Kiddush is said at the end of Friday evening prayers.  This has been done since the [[Middle Ages]].  At that time, people who were [[travel]]ing often ate and slept at the synagogue on Shabbat.  Kiddush was said in the synagogue before they ate their Friday night Shabbat meal. < ref name=KSS > ''Koren Sacks Siddur'' pp. 362-3. < /ref >   In modern times, Kiddush is still said in the synagogue Friday night.  This is done even if a meal is not served in the synagogue that night.   < ref name=KSS / > 
 *'''Morning Kiddush.''' In almost all synagogues, a [[snack]] or light meal is served after Saturday morning prayers.  This meal is called  " Kiddush " , because it starts with the morning Kiddush.  There are two reasons for this snack or meal: 
 **It is not allowed to eat before morning prayers, < ref > ''Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim'' 89:3. < /ref >   but Shabbat morning prayers are long. People are [[wikt:hungry|hungry]] by the end of them. 
 **People are not allowed to [[fasting|fast]] on Shabbat, even for a half-day. < ref > ''Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim'' 288:1 and Babylonian Talmud ''Pesachim'' 12b. < /ref >   This snack or meal helps people have some food before noon if prayers are long. 
 
 ==Kiddush on important Jewish holidays== 
 Kiddush is said on these Jewish holidays:   
 *[[Passover]] (first and last days) 
 *[[Shavuot]] 
 *[[Sukkot]] (first day[s]) 
 *[[Shemini Atzeret]]/[[Simchat Torah]] 
 *[[Rosh Hashanah]] 
 The holiday texts are different from the Shabbat texts. < ref > All references to ''Koren Sacks Siddur:'' Rosh Hashanah evening, pp. 878-881; Rosh Hashanah morning, pp. 880-881; other holiday evenings, pp. 760-763; other holiday mornings, pp. 768-769. < /ref >  The blessings are said in the same way and at the same time of day as on Shabbat, but there are two differences: 
 *On the first night(s) of Passover, Kiddush is ''not'' said in the synagogue.  Kiddush is said at home those nights over the first of four cups of wine at the [[Seder]]. 
 *On the fast of [[Yom Kippur]], Kiddush is not said, even on Shabbat. This is because eating and drinking are not allowed.  The law about  " celebrating "  Shabbat is [[wikt:satisfied|satisfied]] by the evening prayers that night. 
 
 ==The Kiddush cup== 
 Jews usually use a [[wikt:fancy|fancy]] cup for Kiddush.  The most common [[material]] for this cup is [[silver]]. Other materials are also used. These include [[ceramic]], [[glass]] and [[wood]].  The most important part of the custom is for the cup to be special and unusual in [[honor]] of the blessing.
