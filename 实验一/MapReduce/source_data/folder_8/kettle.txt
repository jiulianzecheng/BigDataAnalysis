 A '''kettle''' is a type of pot that is used in a [[kitchen]]. It is used to make water hot or to [[Boiling|boil]] water. It comes from the Latin word ''catillus'' ( " deep pan or dish for cooking " ). < ref > {{Cite web

 In the past, kettles were made of [[metal bins]] like [[copper]]. Kettles were put on a rack or a [[hook]] above the [[fire]] to become hot. Now, metal kettles are put on the [[stove]] or [[rangetop]]. Sometimes they are made of [[ceramic]] or [[clay]].   
 
 Now, some people have [[electric]] kettles. These kettles plug into the wall and use electricity to generate heat. They are usually [[plastic]] or metal. They heat water faster than kettles on a stove. Kettles are often used to make [[tea]].  
 
 They are more common in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] than in other places like the [[United States]].
