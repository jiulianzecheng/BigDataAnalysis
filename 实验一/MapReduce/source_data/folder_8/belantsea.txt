 '''''Belantsea''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[cartilaginous fish]] that lived during the Lower [[Carboniferous]], about 350 million years ago. It belongs to the order [[Petalodontiformes]], which are called [[Petalodontiformes|petalodonts]], in the family [[Belantseidae]]. Its fossils are almost complete individuals. 
 
 ''Belantsea'' is the best known member of the order [[Petalodontiformes]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Belantsea'' would essentially‭ ‬have‭ ‬been the [[Carboniferous]] equivalent of a [[parrotfish]]. Its body was leaf-shaped, with muscular fins and a small tail. Its few, large, triangular teeth formed a beak-like arrangement that allowed it to graze bryozoans, [[Sponge|sponges]], [[Crinoidea|crinoids]], and other encrusting animals.
