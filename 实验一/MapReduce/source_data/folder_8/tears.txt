 '''Tears''' are clear [[liquid]] made by the body to clean and lubricate the [[eye]]s. 
 
 There are three different types of tears that the body makes: 
 
 * ''Basal tears:'' In a normal, healthy [[mammal]], tears are regularly made to clean the [[cornea]] (front part of the eye) and to keep it clean from [[dust]]. 
 
 * ''[[Reflex]] tears:'' This type of tear is made when something irritates the eye, say, bits of dust or the smell of an [[onion]].  These tears are made to clean the eye and wash out anything irritating it. 
 
 * ''Emotional tears'' (psychic tears): The last category is called ''[[crying]]'' or ''weeping'', when tears are made because of physical [[pain]] or strong [[emotion]]s.   
 
 You can produce tears when you cry.
