 '''Bowerbirds''' are the bird [[family (biology)|family]] '''Ptilonorhynchidae'''. The family has 20 species in eight [[genus|genera]]. Bowerbirds are most known for their unique [[Courtship in animals|courtship behaviour]]. Males build a structure and decorate it with sticks and brightly coloured objects. The [[Vogelkop bowerbird]] is a good example. The function of this courtship [[ritual]] is to attract a mate. The bowerbirds have a  " female choice "  mating system. 
 
 The bowerbirds have an Austro-Papuan [[Range (biology)|distribution]], with ten species [[endemism|endemic]] in [[New Guinea]], eight endemic to [[Australia]] and two found in both large islands. < ref name = " Rowland " > {{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Bowerbirds|url=https://archive.org/details/bowerbirdsaustra00rowl|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|location=Collingwood|year=2008|series=Australian Natural History Series|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bowerbirdsaustra00rowl/page/n1 1]–26|isbn=978-0-643-09420-8}} < /ref >  Their distribution is mainly in the tropical parts of New Guinea and northern Australia, though some species extend into central, western and southeastern Australia. They occupy a range of different [[habitats]], including [[rainforest]], [[eucalyptus]] and [[acacia]] forest, and [[shrub]]lands. 
 
 The birds are medium to large-sized [[passerine]]s, ranging from the [[golden bowerbird]] at {{convert|22|cm|inch}} and {{convert|70|g|oz}} to the [[great bowerbird]] at {{convert|40|cm|inch}} and {{convert|230|g|oz}}. Their diet consists mainly of fruit but may also include insects (especially for nestlings), flowers, nectar and leaves in some species. < ref > Frith, Clifford B. 1991. In Forshaw J.
