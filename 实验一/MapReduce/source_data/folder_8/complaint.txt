 In some [[jurisdiction]]s, specific types of [[criminal case]]s may also be started by the filing of a complaint. This is also called a '''criminal complaint''' or '''felony complaint'''. All criminal cases are [[Prosecutor|prosecuted]] in the name of the [[Authority|governmental authority]]. This is the same authority whose [[criminal law]]s were broken and who enforces [[Criminal law|criminal statutes]]. The government is sometimes called ''the state'', ''the People'' or ''the Crown'' (in [[Commonwealth realm]]s). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with [[misdemeanor]] charges presented by the [[prosecutor]] without the [[grand jury]] process. In most [[US]] jurisdictions, the document presented to and authorized by a grand jury is called an [[indictment]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Indictment+%28law%29 |title=Indictment |publisher=The Free Dictionary/Farlex |access-date=29 October 2015}} < /ref >
