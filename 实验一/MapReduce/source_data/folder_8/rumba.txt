'''Rumba''' is a [[music]] and [[dance]] term with two different meanings. 
 
 First, it means [[Cuban]] event of African style, the [[rumba]] genre of [[Cuban music|Afro-Cuban music]]. < ref > Orovio, Helio 2004. ''Cuban music from A to Z''. Duke, Durham NC. p191 < /ref > < ref > Daniel, Yvonne 1995. ''Rumba: Dance and social change in contemporary Cuba''. Indiana University Press, Bloomington IN. < /ref >  This use of the term 'rumba' is quite different from the Latin [[ballroom dance]]. 
 
 Second, it refers to one of the Latin [[ballroom dance]]s. In this sense, the Rumba is the slowest of the five competitive International Latin dances. The [[Paso doble]], the [[Samba]], the [[Cha-cha-cha]] and the [[Jive (dance)|Jive]] are the others. This ballroom Rumba was also danced in Cuba to a rhythm they call the ''bolero-son''. The international style was derived from studies of dance in Cuba in the pre-revolutionary period. < ref name=Lavelle > Lavelle, Doris 1983. ''Latin  &  American dances''. 3rd ed, Black, London. < /ref >

 The ''[[Peanut Vendor]]'' was the first recording of Cuban music to become an international hit. < ref > Giro, Radamés 2007. ''Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba''. La Habana. vol 4, p147  < /ref >  It was described on the label as a ''rumba'', perhaps because the word ''son'' would not be understood in English. The label stuck, and a 'rumba craze' developed through the 1930s. This kind of rumba was introduced into dance salons in America and Europe in the 1930s, and was characterized by variable tempo, sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom Rumba.

 The modern style of dancing the Rumba derives from studies made by dance teacher [[Monsieur Pierre]] (Pierre Zurcher-Margolle). < ref > Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. ''100 years of dance: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board''. London. p62 < /ref > < ref > Julie McMain's ''Glamour Addiction'' notes that Pierre Margolle's professional name was ''Monsieur Pierre''; he and his partner were commonly referred to as  " Monsieur Pierre and Doris Lavelle " ; therefore some writers have incorrectly assumed that Pierre's [[last name]] was Lavelle. < /ref >  Pierre, then from [[London]], visited Cuba in 1947, 1951 and 1953 to find out how and what Cubans were dancing at the time. < ref name=Lavelle/ > < sup > Intro < /sup >   
 
 The international ballroom Rumba is a slower dance of about 120 beats per minute which corresponds, both in music and in dance to what the Cubans of an older generation called the ''bolero-son''. It is easy to see why, for ease of reference and for marketing, ''rumba'' is a better name, however inaccurate. It is the same kind of reason that led later on to the use of [[salsa]] as an overall term for popular music of Cuban origin. 
 
 All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is hardly noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba. Walter Laird put it like this: 
 :[After taking a step to the side]  " Transfer full [[weight]] to this foot allowing the [[pelvis]] to move sideways and back so that the weight is felt to be near the [[heel]] of the standing foot. The [[knee]] of the supporting leg is locked back " . < ref name=Laird > Laird, Walter 2003. ''The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing''. International Dance Publications Ltd. This description incidentally illustrates the difficulty of describing body movements in print. < /ref > < sup > p9 < /sup >   
 In general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced without any rise and fall. This style is authentic, as is the use of free arms in various figures. The basic figures < ref > bronze and silver medals of dance teaching organizations. (see [[ISTD]]) < /ref >  derive from dance moves observed in Havana in the pre-[[Cuban revolution|revolutionary]] period, and have developed their own life since then. Competition figures are often complex, and this is where competition dance separates from social dance. Details can be obtained from the syllabi of dance teaching organizations and from standard texts. < ref name=Lavelle/ > < ref name=Laird/ > < ref > McMains, Juliet E. 2006.
