 '''Tanzanite''' is a blue-purple [[gemstone]] found in [[Tanzania]], in the Mererani Hills near the city of Arusha and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]. It is named after the country of [[Tanzania]], where it is found. It is a kind of a [[mineral]] called [[zoisite]]. When it is first mined, tanzanite is usually a red-brown colour. It needs to be heated to 600 degrees Celsius in a special oven to bring out its purple colour.
