 A '''donkey''' or '''ass''' (''Equus africanus asinus'') is a [[mammal]] of the [[Equidae]] family. < ref > The name ''Equus africanus'' takes precedence over ''Equus asinus'' by a decision of the  [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) concerning the conservation of 17 species names of wild animals with domestic derivatives. < /ref >   
 The wild ancestor of the donkey is the [[African wild ass]], ''E. africanus''. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are a number of other wild asses in different parts of the world.  
 
 The name 'donkey' is correct for the [[Domestication|domesticated]] animal. It is the tame animal that people use for [[transportation]] and other [[Labour (economics)|work]], such as [[wikt:pulling|pulling]] a [[carriage]] or [[wikt:plow|plowing]] a [[field]]. 
 
 Donkeys can have [[hybrid]] children with a common [[horse]]. The child of a [[female]] horse and a [[male]] donkey is called a ''[[mule]]''. The child of a female donkey and a male horse is called a ''hinny''. Mules are more common, and have been used for transportation. 
 
 == Description == 
 Donkeys, [[zebra]]s and [[mule]]s all look different from the common [[horse]]s.  One difference is the [[ear]]s. < ref name= " fact " > {{Cite web

  }} < /ref >  Donkey ears are much longer than horse ears.  The [[neck]]s are straighter and the croup and rump are also a different shape. < ref name= " fact " / >   The back is straighter. 
 
 The [[Mane (horse)|mane]] and [[tail]] of the donkey are rough.  The mane is still and upright, almost always standing up, and the tail is more like a [[cow]]'s, most of it covered with short body [[hair]].  Because their mane sometimes fly away, many donkeys wear their manes clipped short or [[shave]]d close to the neck. < ref name= " fact " / > 
 
 Hoof shapes are different as well, donkey hooves are smaller and rounder, with more upright pasterns. The legs should have good bone, but lots of donkeys have long thin legs with tiny feet. Larger donkeys may appear opposite, with big, heavy legs and large round feet. < ref name= " fact " / >  Good legs and feet are very important for mules that are trying to find a mate. This is because, for breeding, a good foot is more liked than a large body on small legs and feet. < ref name= " fact " / > 
 
 The donkey's voice is very raspy, and it makes a loud  " Ee - Aww "  noise, known as braying (hence Eeyore in the ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' books).  
 
 Although many people think donkeys are gray, many are brown.  Some are black, both red and gray, creamy white, or a unique [[wikt:spot|spotted]] pattern. < ref name= " fact "  / >   Some have [[wikt:stripe|stripes]], dark ear marks, as well as the  " light points " . < ref name= " fact "  / >   This means that it has a white muzzle and white rings around its eyes, and a white belly and inner leg. 
 
 Donkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management.  The height at the [[withers]] ranges from 7.3 to 15.3 [[Hand (unit)|hands]] (31 to 63 inches, 79 to 160 cm), and the weight from 80 to 480 kg (180 to 1,060 lb).  Some, like the rare French donkey, have huge heads and ears, and very thick, shaggy curled black coat. < ref name= " fact "  / > 
 
 Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a [[life expectancy]] of 12 to 15 years. 
 
 == Caring for donkeys == 
 
 Good grass [[hay]] and pasture is usually what donkeys enjoy to eat. If the hay or grass is grained, the [[protein]] is best to be lower than 12%. However, if a donkey is overfed, it will have a  " roll "  on the neck. A roll is when fat bunches up and stays in a part of a donkey's body, and they usually happen on its neck or its hip. < ref name= " donkey " > {{Cite web

 }} < /ref >  If they develop on the donkey, it will usually stay for its whole life. If the neck roll of fat gets too heavy, it will fall or  " break over "  to one side and never recover its balance again. This is why donkeys should not be fed too much. Many people do not like to work with donkeys. They think that donkeys are too [[wikt:stubborn|stubborn]] and will kick them. However, a donkey that is nicely trained can be as easily managed as other horses. < ref name= " donkey " / >
