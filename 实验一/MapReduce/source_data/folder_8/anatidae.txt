 The '''anatidae''' are the biological family of [[bird]]s that includes the [[duck]]s, [[Goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. < ref > Carboneras, Carles 1992. Family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans).

 These birds are common and widespread, and live in or near water. The family has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], on all the world's continents except [[Antarctica]] and on most of the world's islands and island groups. 
 
 These are [[bird]]s that are [[adapted]] for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases [[diving]]. The family has about 146 species in 40 [[genus|genera]]. They are usually [[herbivorous]], and are [[monogamy|monogamous]] breeders. A number of species do [[animal migration|annual migrations]]. A few species have been [[domesticated]] for agriculture, and many others are hunted for food and recreation. Five species have become extinct since 1600, and others are close to [[extinction]].
