In military terminology, a '''missile''' is a guided airborne ranged [[weapon]] capable of self-propelled [[flight]]. In general, a missile may refer to anything thrown or launched [[object]] at a target like a [[javelin]] or [[darts]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.dartsgames.co.za/ |title=Darts - Darts Rules - Darts Games - Dart Board Games - Playing Darts |access-date=2015-01-28 |archive-date=2015-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224193105/http://www.dartsgames.co.za/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Nowadays, it means, mostly, a self-propelled guided [[weapon]] system. Missiles are used in [[war]] to destroy military targets.[[File:Moscow Parad 2008 Ballist.jpg|thumb|280px|MBR ''Topol M''  < ref > {{cite web | title = World's military powers | work = The Independent | url = http://www.independent.co.ug/index.php/reports/world-report/74-world-report-/172-worlds-military-powers | access-date = 2011-01-22 | archive-date = 2010-05-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100530062700/http://www.independent.co.ug/index.php/reports/world-report/74-world-report-/172-worlds-military-powers | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  at the [[Moscow]] parade rehearsal.]] Missiles can carry [[explosive]]s or other destructive [[load]]s. The loads a missile may carry are called a  " payload " . It is not always harmful to people. 
 
 For example, cruise missiles have carried  " graphite bombs "  to destroy [[electrical power]] systems without much collateral damage. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/blu-114.htm|title=BLU-114/B  " Soft-Bomb " |last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2018-10-06}} < /ref >  Missiles are also one of the causes of [[Explosion|explosions]]. 
 
 ==Types of missiles== 
 The two main kinds of missiles are simple  " [[rocket]]s "  and  " guided missiles " . A rocket is no longer controlled once it has been launched. Most guided missile are also propelled by a [[rocket engine]] but can be controlled after it has been launched. Some missiles used in [[anti-aircraft warfare]], such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], guide themselves with [[temperature]]. Others guide themselves by [[radar]] or are under [[radio control]].  
 
 Cruise missiles are big missiles that carry large payloads to hit ground targets or to badly damage/sink ships. Ballistic missiles look similar, but they keep the engine off and don't stay at a lower height to be more accurate like cruise missiles do. Instead, they go high up to the edge of space and turn off the engine. Since there's no air friction in space, they don't need the engine on to continue moving forward at the same speed. They then crash into the target from the sky. The Topol M is the missile in the picture and is a ballistic missile. In short, cruise missiles have an engine always running and fly low through the atmosphere to get to a target. Ballistic missiles go to the edge of space and turn off their engine to fall to a target. You could say cruise missiles fly while ballistic missiles fall.   
 
 The [[V-1 flying bomb]] was an early cruise missile, a little pilotless airplane with a bomb, propelled by a [[jet engine]] instead of a rocket.
