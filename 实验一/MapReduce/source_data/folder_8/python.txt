 '''''Python''''' is the name given to a [[genus]] of [[:en:Constriction|constricting]] [[snake]]s. < ref > Hannover Zoo: [http://www.zoo-hannover.de/zoo-erleben/tiere-von-a-z/tigerpython.html#steckbrief Python] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203152843/http://www.zoo-hannover.de/zoo-erleben/tiere-von-a-z/tigerpython.html#steckbrief |date=2013-02-03 }}, viewed 2012-12-07 < /ref >  Such snakes are not [[Venom (poison)|venomous]]. its [[family (biology)|family]] is the ''Pythonidae''. Pythons are more closely related to [[boa]]s than to any other snake family.  
 
 [[George Albert Boulenger|Boulenger]] (1890) thought this group was a subfamily (Pythoninae) of the family [[Boidae]] (boas). < ref name= " McD99 " > McDiarmid R.W; Campbell J.A.  &  Touré T. 1999. ''Snake species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference''. vol. 1, Herpetologists' League. {{ISBN|1-893777-00-6}} (series). {{ISBN|1-893777-01-4}} < /ref >  However, boas produce live young, while pythons are [[oviparous]]: they lay eggs. 
 
 ''Python'' can be found in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Africa]], and other members of the family are found in [[New Guinea]] and [[Australia]]. Pythons can range from 3 feet long in species like ball pythons to 29 feet in species like reticulated pythons. ''Python'' is one of eight [[genera]] in the family. They all have a rather similar [[life style]]. 
 
 Most members of the family are [[ambush predator]]s: they stay motionless in a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey. They wrap their body round the prey and squeeze. To kill its prey, the python squeezes it to death, < ref > The death is caused by suffocation ([[asphyxiation]]): the prey cannot breathe. < /ref >  then swallows it whole. Larger pythons can prey on animals as large as a full-grown deer. In Africa, there are pythons that eat [[gazelle]]s. Most of their prey is much smaller than that. Pythons may take several days or even weeks to fully digest prey. 
 Despite their size, pythons are rarely dangerous to humans. 
 
 ''Python'' can be up to 900 & nbsp;cm long and weigh up to 90 & nbsp;kg, but males are much smaller and lighter than females. The python can live up to 30 years. The breeding time is between 60 or 70 days. 
 
 Research indicates that all snakes, including pythonids, are children from a venomous father. < ref name= " fry " > {{cite journal|author=Bryan G.

 [[Burmese python]]s have become an [[invasive species]] in south [[Florida]]. The problem is most serious in the  [[Everglades National Park]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-have-invasive-pythons-impacted-florida-ecosystems?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products|title = How have invasive pythons impacted Florida ecosystems?  & #124; U.S. Geological Survey}} < /ref >
