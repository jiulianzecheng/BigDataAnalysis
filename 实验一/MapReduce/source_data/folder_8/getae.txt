 The '''Getae''' ({{lang-el|Γέται}}, singular Γέτης) was the name given by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to several Thracian tribes who lived in the region south of the [[Danube|Lower Danube]]. It is now known today as northern [[Bulgaria]], and north of the Lower Danube, in [[Romania]]. 
 
 They spoke the ancient Thracian language like their neighbors, the [[Dacia]]ns. There was also a branch of Tyragetae on the [[Dniester River]], and two tribes of Massagetae and Thyssagetae in [[Scythia]]. Many historians of the 4th to 6th centuries AD referred to the [[Goths]], who then lived in the same area north of the Danube, as ''Getae''.{{Reference necessary}}
