 '''Bennettitales''' (also known as '''cycadeoids''') is an extinct [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]]. < ref > Arens NC, Stromberg C, Thompson A.  " Introduction to the Bennettitales " . University of California Museum of Paleontology. [https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/seedplants/bennettitales.html] < /ref > 
 
 They first appeared in the [[Permian]] period and became extinct in most places toward the end of the [[Cretaceous]]. Bennettitales are among the most common Mesozoic seed plants. They looked like [[Shrub|shrubs]] or [[cycad]]s.  
 
 Although the leaves of the Bennettitales looked like that of cycads, they had more complex flower-like reproductive organs. So some of them were probably pollinated by insects. < ref name= " :8 " > {{cite journal|vauthors=Peñalver E, Arillo A, Pérez-de la Fuente R, Riccio ML, Delclòs X, Barrón E, Grimaldi DA|date=2015|title=Long-proboscid flies as pollinators of Cretaceous gymnosperms |journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=14|pages=1917–23|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.062|pmid=26166781|doi-access=free}} < /ref > 
 
 Certainly Bennettitales were cone-bearing seed plants. However, their relationship to other [[seed plants]] is unclear.
