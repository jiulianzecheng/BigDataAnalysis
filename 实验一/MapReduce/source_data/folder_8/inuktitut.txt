 '''Inuktitut''' is a [[language]] of the [[Arctic]], spoken by [[Inuit]]s in [[Canada]] and in [[Greenland]].  Inuktitut is a very complex language.  It is an official language in [[Nunavut]] and the [[Northwest Territories]]. 
 
 The Inuit write Inuktitut in two ways. One way to write Inuktitut is by using the Roman alphabet. The other way to write Inuktitut is by using an abugida, which is a kind of alphabet which has  letters based on [[syllable]]s. 
 
 The [[:Image:Inuktitut.png|Inuktitut syllabary]] uses a small part of the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, a set of letters made up for writing down many of the languages of the [[First Nations]] people  in Canada. 
 
 Some words in English come from Inuktitut or another Inuit language. Among them are the words anorak, [[igloo]], and [[kayak]].
