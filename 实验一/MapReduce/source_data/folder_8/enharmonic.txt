In [[music]], two [[note (music)|notes]], [[interval (music)|intervals]], or [[key signature]]s are '''enharmonic''' if they sound the same but are written in different ways. For example, C-sharp and D-flat are enharmonic notes. [[C-sharp major]] and [[D-flat major]] start on enharmonic notes, so they are enharmonic key signatures, but they have different numbers of sharps and flats. An augmented fourth and a diminished fifth are enharmonic intervals, because they both cover 6 [[half step]]s. < ref name= " B & S54 " > {{cite book|last1=Benward|first1=Bruce|last2=Saker|first2=Marilyn|year=2003|title=Music in Theory and Practice|volume=I|page=7  &  360|isbn=978-0-07-294262-0}} < /ref >
