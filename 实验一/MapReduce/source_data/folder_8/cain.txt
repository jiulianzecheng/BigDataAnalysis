 Cain and Abel both gave gifts to God.  God liked Abel's gift more than Cain's. Cain became [[jealousy|jealous]] of Abel.  Later, Cain hit Abel in the head with a rock.  Abel died.  When God asked Cain where Abel was, Cain pretended he did not know.  He said,  " [[Am I my brother's keeper?]] " 
 
 God punished Cain by [[exile]]: He made Cain leave the place where he lived.  He made Cain go away.  He told Cain that if he tried to build a [[farm]], the earth  " would not yield up its strength. "  When Cain said he was afraid, God put a mark on him to protect him. 
 
 Cain went east and lived as a wanderer.  Some scholars say that the story of Cain was told to explain why some humans [[agriculture|build farms and stay in one place]] and others [[nomad|move from place to place]]. < ref name=Cath / >
