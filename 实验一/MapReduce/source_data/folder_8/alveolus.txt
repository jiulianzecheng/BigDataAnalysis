 An '''alveolus''' (plural: '''alveoli''') is a word used in [[anatomy]] for hollow cavities, which are empty areas within a body. 
 
 Although there are many different types of alveoli in the body, the word alveoli is usually used to talk about small air sacs in the [[lung]]s of [[mammal]]s. These are also called ''pulmonary alveoli''. These alveoli are located at the ends of the [[bronchiole|air passageways]] in the lungs. They have very thin (one [[cell]] thick), wet walls and are surrounded with a network of small blood vessels, or [[capillaries]]. This allows [[gas]]es to [[diffusion|diffuse]], or move across, the surface of the alveolus. 
 
 When a mammal breathes in, the [[concentration]] of [[oxygen]] is higher in the alveolus than in the [[red blood cells]]. Therefore, oxygen leaves the alveolus and enters the red blood cells. When a mammal breathes out, the opposite happens. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] is lower in the alveolus than in the red blood cells, so carbon dioxide leaves the red blood cells, enters the alveolus, and is [[exhalation|exhaled]]. 
 
 In an average human lung, there are 480 million alveoli. < ref name= " number " > {{cite journal |author=Ochs, M. | display-authors = etal |date=1 January 2004 |title=The Number of Alveoli in a Human Lung |journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 169 | issue = 1 | pages = 120–124 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200308-1107OC | pmid = 14512270 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14512270}} < /ref >  Their total surface area is around 75 square meters. < ref > {{cite book |title= Functional Ultrastructure: An Atlas of Tissue Biology and Pathology  |publisher=Springer Vienna |location= |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-211-83564-7 |pages=224–225 |chapter=Alveoli: Gas Exchange and Host Defense |doi=10.1007/978-3-211-99390-3_128 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-211-99390-3_128|last1=Pavelka |first1=Margit |last2=Roth |first2=Jürgen }} < /ref > 
 
 Inside the alveoli is where a gas exchange happens. Gas exchange is how different gases (usually two) move in opposite directions across a specialised respiratory surface. Gases are constantly required and produced as a by-product of cellular and metabolic reactions so an efficient system to exchange them  is extremely important. It is linked with respiration in animals, and both respiration and [[photosynthesis]] in plants.
