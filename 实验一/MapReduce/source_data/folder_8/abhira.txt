 ==Origin and History== 
 The Abhiras have been described in the history of [[Ancient India]] as a tribe, which migrated from one place to another, and finally settled in various regions. They are said to have developed a complexity in their culture due to fusion of their tribal with the regional cultures and traditions, which are still living. The problem of migration is one of the most important features of the history of India, which itself based on literary and historical material, is one of the expansion of the vista of the country, which was colonized, physically and culturally by higher communities displacing the established tribals to the hilly regions and forests. The Abhiras or Ahiras are conspicuous example of this rule. 
 
 When political condition settled down and a full-fledged state system came into existence, this expansionist urge resulted in the emergence of larger and the smaller states, culminating in the empires of Indian history. The Abhiras after undergoing the process of migration from South India established kingdoms in northern and western India. It is presumed that this exciting movement of the Abhiras took place at about the beginning of the Christian era which is not very correct. At that time, their settlements are supposed to confine to Sind, Panjab, Haryana and Rajasthan—parts adjoining to Gujarat, as recorded by the Mahabharata. In the next few centuries, they consolidated themselves in Saurastra, Gujarat, Malava and khandesha, south India, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and even in Assam and Nepal. The earliest authentic reference on the Abhiras can be seen in the Mahabhasya of Patanjali (1.2.3) wherein they have been mentioned as a separate caste and have been associated with the Sudras. Other sources of our information, among others, are— Mahabharata, Ramayana, Markandeya Purana, Padma-Purdana, Mricchakatika, Prabodhacandrodaya, Pratijnayaugandharayana, and a lot of other literary works. 
 
 According to some [[Author|authors]], the origin of the Abhiras i is steeped in obscurity. Though there are many references about the Abhiras in [[Ancient India]] [[literature]], hardly any of them throw any light on their origin. In support of their argument they quote Mahabhasya of [[Patanjali]] who mentions them as a tribe distinct from the [[Shudra|Sudras]], but no information about their origin is available from it. The [[Mahabharata]] depicts them living with the predatory forest tribes. According to the Bhuvanakosa chapters of the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Puranas]] these forest tribes were organised in the form of ganas of the mercenaries and freebooters, hostile to [[Aryan|Aryans]]. But in later references they have also been connected with the fourfold order of the society. According to an interpolation in the Manusmrti the Abhiras were born of an Ambastha woman and a [[Brahmanas|Brahmana]] father. 
 
 Enthoven, an administrator of the [[British Raj]] and gentleman-scholar, believed that Abhiras might have entered [[India]] from [[Afghanistan]]. < ref name= " google " > {{cite book|author=Reginald Edward Enthoven |title=The tribes and castes of Bombay |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoT6gPrbTp8C & pg=PA23 |accessdate=20 June 2011 |date=1 January 1990 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |isbn=978-81-206-0630-2 |pages=23–}} < /ref > < ref name= " google9 " > {{cite book|author=Dineshchandra Sircar |title=Studies in the geography of ancient and medieval India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqKw1Mn8WcwC & pg=PA32 |accessdate=20 June 2011 |year=1971 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0690-0 |pages=32–}} < /ref >  The pastoral setting of the stories about Krishna's childhood may have originated in legends of a god worshipped by the Abhira tribe.

 Bhagwan Singh Suryavanshi says archaeological research in Deccan has revealed the presence of pastoral people of the Neolithic era who shares many attributes of the Abhira. Hence, they might have been present much earlier than has been previously postulated so. He concludes that they spread from [[Indus]] to Mathura, and migrated southward and eastward. < ref > Bhagwan singh Suryavanshi, Abhira their history  &  culture (MS University Archaeology,  &  Ancient History Series, No.6) xvi, Maharaja Siyajirao, university of Baroda, 1962 < /ref >  He also says that similarity of culture and a common belief that they are descendants of [[Krishna]] is proof that they sprang from a common source.

He concludes from the Padma [[Purana]], where [[Vishnu]] informed Abhiras,  " I shall be born among you, O Abhiras, at Mathura in my eighth birth " . D. R. Bhandarkar supports the non-Aryan origin theory, directly relating Krishna to Rig Veda's  " Krishna Drapsah " , where he fights the Aryan god [[Indra]]. Abhiras were the people of Yadava community.

 Others believe that Abhiras were originally nomadic pastoral tribes fom the lower Indus valley in modern Pakistan, who migrated eastwards and southwards across Avanti which includes districts of western [[Madhya Pradesh]] and parts of south-eastern [[Rajasthan]]. < ref name= " googlebook2 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10bVNjRwE_0C & dq=abhira & pg=PA3|title=Indian Kāvya Literature: The early medieval period: Śūdraka to Viśākhadatta|author=Anthony Kennedy Warder|date=1977|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|isbn=9788120804456|pages=Page No. 3|accessdate=22 September 2014}} < /ref >  They were warriors, and after serving in the armies of various states, especially of the [[Saka]]s, some of their leaders set up an independent princes at mountainous strongholds in Southern India. < ref > Indian Kāvya Literature: The early medieval period: Śūdraka to Viśākhadatta Page3 < /ref > 
 
 Commenting on this Bhandarkar says, Krishna is the Hinduised form of Jesus Christ, whose teachings Abhira have brought from outside, at the beginning of Christian Era, because Krishna is called Christo near Weastern Coast, and Dalliance element in Krishna's life is inspired from traditions of Abhira tribe. 
 
 Ghurye, contradicts this by saying Abhira as a tribe is mentioned in the works of Patanjali, dated 150 BC, by most conservative sources, so they definitely haven't entered at the beginning of the Christian era and possibly their presence goes very far into antiquity. Also, proofs of Extra Marital relationships exists within genealogy of Yadus so it is wrong to say Abhira are the source of Dlliance element, and he fails to see the difference between Abhira and the tribe of Krishna. 
 
 However, Smith has raised two questions on this synthesis by above scholars. First, If Abhira are Yadavs then why Mahabharata mentions them having abducted wives and children of Krishna and second, why Abhira kings names are after Shiva and not Vishnu till as late as 800AD, who is a rival god. 
 
 Dr. J.N. Singh Yadav and MSA Rao has contradicted Smith by saying, Those Abhira who abducted Krishna's Wives and Children might be Yadavs who were supporters of Duryodhna, and they also shows there is no rivalry between Shiva and Krishna.Mahabharta says that those Abhiras who looted Arjuna were the supporters of the Kauravas, and in the Mahabharata, '''Abhira''', [[Gopa (caste)|Gopa]], Gopal and '''[[Yadav|Yadavas]]''' are all synonyms. 
 
 The Yadavs, mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]], were pastoral [[Kshatriya|kshatriyas]] among whom [[Krishna]] was brought up. The [[Gopa (caste)|Gopas]], whom [[Krishna]] had offered to Duryodhana to fight in his support when he himself joined Arjuna's side, were no other than the Yadavs themselves, who were also the Abhiras. In the Mahabharata it is mentioned that when the Yadavas (belonging to the Abhira group) abandoned Dwaraka and Gujarat after the death of Krishna and retreated northwards under Arjuna's leadership, they were attacked and broken up. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGMqAQAAIAAJ|title=Man in India|last=Bahadur)|first=Sarat Chandra Roy (Rai|date=1974|publisher=A.K.
