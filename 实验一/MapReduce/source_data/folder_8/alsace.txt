 '''Alsace''' ([[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] and [[Alemannic German]]: ''Elsàss'', pre-1996 [[German language|German]]: ''Elsaß'') was an administrative region of [[France]]. It is now part of the administrative region of [[Grand Est]]. Alsace was on the eastern border of France. It was on the west bank of the Upper [[Rhine]], next to [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].  
 
 The departments in Alsace were [[Bas-Rhin]] and [[Haut-Rhin]]. 
 
 Before the region merged with [[Champagne-Ardenne]] and [[Lorraine]] in [[2014]], data from [[INSEE]] stated that about 1.8 million people lived there as of 2013. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/recensement/populations-legales/france-regions.asp?annee=2013|language=fr|title=Populations légales 2013 des régions|publisher=[[INSEE]]|access-date=1 July 2016}} < /ref >  Its [[capital city|capital]] was [[Strasbourg]], the largest [[city]]. It changed hands between France and Germany many times. The people living there had an attitude and set of social values that was closer to the German ones, than the French. Language, cuisine, music, dress and customs were Germanic, and very close to the [[Swabia]]n ones across the Rhine. The overall culture was generally more [[Germany|German]] than French, being somewhere between German and French.   
 
 Alsace was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and was still inhabited by people speaking a dialect of [[Upper German]].  In the [[17th century]], all of Alsace was annexed (in steps) under [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]]. He made it one of the provinces of France.  
 
 The [[Treaty of Verdun]] had divided the empire of [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century, eventually causing Alsace to be frequently mentioned in conjunction with [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], because the possession of these two ''régions'' (as ''[[Alsace-Lorraine]]'') was often contested in the 19th and 20th centuries.
