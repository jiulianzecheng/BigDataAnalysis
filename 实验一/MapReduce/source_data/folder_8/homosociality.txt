'''Homosociality''' is a term used in [[sociology]], which describes a [[Same-sex couple|same-sex relationship]] which is not romantic or [[sexual]] in nature. These relationships might be called friendships, mentorships, or other. [[Heterosociality]] is the opposite. It means that one prefers socializing with members of the opposite sex without bringing romance or sex into the relationship. [[Eve Sedgwick]] made the term popular in her discussion of male homosocial desire, < ref > J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 138 < /ref >  but [[Jean Lipman-Blumen]] had defined homosociality in 1976 as a preference for members of one's own sex. < ref > Merl Storr, ''Latex and Lingerie'' (2003) p. 39-40 < /ref > 
 
 For example, a close relationship between two men (such as George and Lennie in ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' (and indeed most of the characters in that book) would be a homosocial relationship. It can apply to single sex schools, [[Prison|prisons]], [[Monastery|monasteries]], but also to simple friendships. 
 
 The relationship ''can'' be a sexual one, but a homosocial relationship can occur between homosexuals, heterosexuals or both. 
 
 It is often used to describe the all-male world of medieval [[Knight|knights]], or [[Sailor|sailors]]. While it can apply to both men or women, it is most commonly used to refer to men. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1177%2F1097184x06287761 & |title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|website=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/1097184x06287761 |s2cid=145135916 }} < /ref >

 Rose < ref > Rose, S.M. (1985). Same- and cross-sex friendships and the psychology of homosociality.  Sex Roles, 12(1/2), 63-75. < /ref >  surveyed males and females between the ages of 20 and 28. Rose asked men and women about how they felt about same and cross-sex friendships.  Both men and women preferred same sex friendships.  Both men and women said that cross-sex relationships were less helpful, and less loyal than same-sex friendships. Friendship formation was found to be different between cross-sex and same-sex relationships as well.   
 
 Depending on the culture, and family and social stuctures, same-sex preferences have been found to  develop between 3 and 9 years old. (LaFreniere, Strayer, &  Gauthier, 1984; Jacklin &  Maccoby, 1978; Harkness  &  Super, 1985) < ref name= " Harkness, S. 1985 " > Harkness, S.,  &  Super, C.M. (1985).

Advances in Child Development and Behavior, 20, 239-287. < /ref > < ref name= " LaFreriere, P. 1984 " > LaFreriere, P., Strayer, F.F.,  &  Gauthier, R. (1984). The emergence of same-sex preferences among preschool peers: A developmental ethological perspective. Child Development, 55, 1958-1965. < /ref >  LaFreniere, Strayer, and Gauthier (1984) < ref name= " LaFreriere, P. 1984 " / >  conducted a three year long study observing fifteen [[Peer group|peer groups]] between the ages of 1 to 6 years old, with 98 boys and 93 girls.  As they looked into sex-segregation in childhood, the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exihibit these preferences around 3–4 years old. However, in a study by Harkenss and Super, < ref name= " Harkness, S. 1985 " / >  [[Kenya]]n children did not have sex-preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didn’t occur until parental expectations and customary duties increased.  “Just when and how such gender segration appears, is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche” (Harkness  &  Super, 1985). < ref name= " Harkness, S. 1985 " / > 
 
 The social bias towards members of one’s own sex can develop early in children. Specifically, studies have found that by the early age of 3 or 4, children prefer members of their own sex to members of the opposite sex (Bussey  &  Bandura, 1992). < ref > Bussey, K.,  &  Bandura, A. (1992). Self-regulatory mechanisms governing gender development. Child Development, 63, 1236-1250. < /ref >  That is, young girls favor girls and women over boys and men. The findings are identical for young boys. Also, Carol Martin (1989) < ref > Martin, C. L. (1989) Children’s use of gender-related information in making social judgments. Developmental Psychology, 25, 80-88. < /ref >  found that boys 4.5 years of age expressed significantly more dislike for a girl depicted as a “[[tomboy]]” than a boy depicted as a “[[sissy]]”; whereas boys 8.5 years of age express more dislike for a boy depicted as a “sissy”. This age difference suggests that children as young as 4 prefer their own sex regardless of [[gender-incongruent behavior]]. Around the age of 8 however, boys begin to show males—devaluing feminine behavior. It has also been shown that children ages 10–12 prefer same-sex socializing. That is, girls favored girls who socialized with other girls and boys liked boys who socialized with other boys. < ref > Lobel, T. E., Bempechat, J., Gewirtz, J. C., Shoken- Topaz, T.,  &  Bashe, E. (1993). The role of gender-related information and self-endorsement traits in preadolescents’ inferences and judgments. Child Development, 64, 1285-1294. < /ref >

 Homosociality, by definition, implies neither [[heterosexuality]] nor [[homosexuality]]. For example, a heterosexual male who prefers to socialize with men may be considered a homosocial heterosexual.  The term is often used by [[Feminism|feminists]] to emphasize aspects of solidarity between males. Feminists also identify a close link between female homosociality, feminism and [[lesbian]] desire, with [[Audre Lorde]] stating  " the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women.
