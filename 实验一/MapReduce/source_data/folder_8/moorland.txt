 '''Moorland''' or '''moor''' is a type of [[habitat]] that one can find in upland areas, that are characterised by [[acid]]ic soils.  
 
 Moorland habitats are rather common in the [[Neotropic ecozone|neotropics]] and [[Tropics|tropical]] [[Africa]] but one can find them also in small scattered places in northern and western [[Europe]], northern [[Australia]], [[North America]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In the tiny areas of European moorlands tend to be  environments with only very few [[species]]. They are often dominated by [[Calluna|heather]]. In the far more extensive moorlands of the tropics species [[Biodiversity|diversity]] can be extremely high.  
 
 Moorlands differ from typical [[heathland]] in being colder and much wetter, often with extensive [[bog]]s. 
 
 ==Famous moorlands in the UK== 
 Notable areas of upland moorland in Britain include the [[Dark Peak]], the [[Forest of Bowland]], the [[Lake District]], the [[Pennines]], [[The desert of Wales|Mid Wales]], the [[Southern Uplands]] of Scotland, the [[Scottish Highlands]] and a few very small pockets in western [[Herefordshire]].

 ==Conservation== 
 In Europe if the heather and other [[vegetation]] is left for too long, a large volume of dry and combustible material builds up. This may cause a [[fire]] which may burn out a large area. But generally moorland [[wildlife]] copes with even major fires and are easily able to recover if such intense burnings are not too frequent.
