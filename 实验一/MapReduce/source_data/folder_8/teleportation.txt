'''Teleportation''' is the supposed [[movement]] of [[matter]] from one point to another without travelling across the physical [[space]] between them. This has been shown in [[science fiction]] movies to move objects and people quickly from one place to another. In the real world however, no one knows if and how such a move could ever be performed. Therefore it remains a purely fictional idea to date.
