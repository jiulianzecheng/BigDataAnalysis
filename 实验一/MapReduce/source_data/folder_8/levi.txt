[[Levi]] was a [[person]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] who was a [[son]] of [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]]. Along with his [[brother]] [[Simeon]] he [[kill]]ed the men of Shechem for the [[rape]] of [[Dinah]]. Because of that, his [[father]] Jacob told him that his [[tribe]] would not have his land as part of their [[inheritance]] but would live on the land of other [[tribe]]s. 
 
 ==Children== 
 Levi had three sons and they were named Gershon, Kehath and Merari. 
 
 ==Moses and Aaron== 
 Kehath had a son named Amaram. Amaram married a woman named Yocheved and became the [[father]] of [[Miriam]], [[Aaron]] and [[Moses]]. Moses became the [[prophet]] to the [[Israelites]] and Aaron became the [[High Priest]].  
 
 ==Levites== 
 While the [[sons]] of Aaron and their [[male]] [[descendant]]s became the [[priest]]s, the rest of Levi’s [[descendant]] known as the [[Levite]]s helped the priests in the [[sanctuary]]. Their [[tribe]] didn’t get any land of their own because they instead had to be the [[religious]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s to everyone in the other tribes who had to let the Levites live on their land.
