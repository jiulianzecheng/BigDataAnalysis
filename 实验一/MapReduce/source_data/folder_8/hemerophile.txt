 '''Hemerophile''' is a term used for animals and plants that profit from the changes [[human]]s have made to their environment. For this reason, they can often be found in the [[cultural landscape]] of humans; they are said to follow humans. Some species that live closely together with humans, and that have followed them to their immediate surroundings are called [[synanthrope]]s.
