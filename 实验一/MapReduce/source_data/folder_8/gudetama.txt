Gudetama was created by Emi Nagashima. Gudetama became popular because many saw the character as relatable. Gudetama isn't as popular as [[Hello Kitty]], but certainly [[profit]]able. Gudetama was in a show in Japan from 2014 - 2020. It is the main character of ''Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure''. [[Video game]]s and [[comics]] also exist. There are branded [[Fixed-wing aircraft|airplanes]] and [[train]]s. Restaurants have served Gudetama-themed foods. The character has featured on [[clothing]], [[stationery]] and [[toy]]s.
