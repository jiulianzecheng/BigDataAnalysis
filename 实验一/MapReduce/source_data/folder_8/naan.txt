 '''Naan bread''' is a type of [[bread]] made with flour. It is a [[flatbread]] that is baked in a [[tandoor]]. Naan bread often looks like a [[tear|tear drop]]. It is often covered in [[herbs]] and [[spices]] such as [[garlic]] to change the taste. 
 
 Naan bread is made from basic bread ingredients like wheat flour, a [[leavening agent]] (either [[yeast]], [[yogurt]], [[baking powder]], or all), salt, and butter or [[ghee]]. It also is made with yogurt and milk. The yogurt is what makes naan bread taste so much different than other kinds of bread.
