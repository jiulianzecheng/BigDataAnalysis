 If one considers a tetromino that has been moved (translated), turned (rotated) or flipped (reflected) to be the same shape, there are five distinct tetrominoes. These are known as '''free tetrominoes'''. 
 
 Tetrominoes are well known for being the game pieces used in the video game ''[[Tetris]]'', which was created by [[Alexey Pajitnov]]. < ref > [http://tetris.com/about-tetris/  " About Tetris " ], Tetris.com. Retrieved 2014-04-19. < /ref >  ''Tetris'' uses '''one-sided tetrominoes''', which can be translated and rotated but not reflected. This makes for a total of seven tetrominoes.
