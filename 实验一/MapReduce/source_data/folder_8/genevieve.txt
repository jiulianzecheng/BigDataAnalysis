 '''Saint Genevieve''' is a [[saint]] in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition. She is the patron saint of [[Paris]]. Her feast day is kept on January the 3rd. 
 
 In 451 she led a  " prayer marathon "  in Paris that was said to divert [[Attila]]'s Huns away from the city. In 464 [[Childeric I]] besieged the city and conquered it. She negotiated to collect food and convinced Childeric to release his prisoners. 
 
 [[Clovis I]] founded an abbey where Genevieve could minister. She was later buried there. < ref > {{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|url=https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary0000farm_d3u1|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ.
