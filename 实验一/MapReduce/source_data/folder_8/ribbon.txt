 A '''ribbon''' is a thin, flexible band, usually [[cloth]] but also [[plastic]] or sometimes [[metal]].  
 
 Ribbons are mostly used for tying or decorating things. Ribbons can be used to tie a person's hair, decorate clothing or [[uniform]]s, or to tie up packages. A [[typewriter]] uses a cloth or plastic ribbon to hold the ink.
