 The '''Myriapoda''' is a sub[[phylum]] of [[arthropod]]s. It contains the [[millipede]]s, [[centipede]]s, and others. The group has 13,000 species, all of which are [[terrestrial]]. < ref name= " Berkeley " > {{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/arthropoda/uniramia/myriapoda.html |title=Introduction to the Myriapoda |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |author=Ben Waggoner |date=1996}} < /ref >  Their name suggests they have many legs. In fact one has over 750 legs (''Illacme plenipes''), but some have fewer than ten legs. < ref name= " Illacme " > {{cite journal |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7094 |page=707 |date=2006 |doi=10.1038/441707a |title=Biodiversity hotspots: rediscovery of the world's leggiest animal |author=Paul E.

 The [[fossil]] record of myriapods goes back into the late [[Silurian]], though molecular evidence suggests they [[adaptive radiation|diversified]] in the [[Cambrian]] period. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Markus Friedrich  &  Diethard Tautz |year=2002 |journal=Nature |volume=376 |issue=6536 |pages=165–167 |doi=10.1038/376165a0 |title=Ribosomal DNA phylogeny of the major extant arthropod classes and the evolution of myriapods |pmid=7603566 |bibcode=1995Natur.376..165F|s2cid=4270910 }} < /ref >  Cambrian fossils do exist which look like myriapods. < ref name= " Berkeley " / > 
 
 == Structure == 
 '''Myriapods''' have a single pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] and, in most cases, simple eyes. The mouthparts lie on the underside of the head, 
 . There is an  " epistome "  and [[labrum]] forming the upper lip, and a pair of [[maxilla (arthropod)|maxillae]] forming the lower lip. A pair of [[mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]] lie inside the mouth. Myriapods breathe through [[spiracle]]s that connect to a [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] similar to that of insects. 
 
 == Classification == 
 There has been much debate as to which arthropod group is most closely related to the Myriapoda. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Gregory D. Edgecombe |year=2004 |url=http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/ctz/vol73/nr03/art02 |title=Morphological data, extant Myriapoda, and the myriapod stem-group |journal=Contributions to Zoology |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=207–252 |doi=10.1163/18759866-07303002 |access-date=2011-10-18 |archive-date=2012-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118171905/http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/ctz/vol73/nr03/art02 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Under the [[Mandibulata]] hypothesis, Myriapoda is the [[sister taxon]] to [[Pancrustacea]], a group comprising the [[Crustacea]] and [[Hexapoda]].

 There are four classes of living myriapods, [[centipede|Chilopoda]] (centipedes), [[millipede|Diplopoda]] (millipedes), [[Pauropoda]] and [[Symphyla]]. There is a total of around 12,000 living [[species]]. < ref name= " Chapman " > {{cite book |author = Chapman A.D. |title=Numbers of living species in Australia and the World |publisher=Department of the Environment and Heritage |year=2005 |isbn=0-642-56850-2  |page=23 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/pubs/number-living-species-report.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025220345/http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/pubs/number-living-species-report.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2011}} < /ref >  While each of these groups of myriapods is believed to be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], relationships among them are less certain. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Jerome C.

 ===Centipedes=== 
 [[File:Scolopendra fg01.JPG|thumb|''Scolopendra cingulata'', a centipede, in [[France]]]] 
 {{main|Centipede}} 
 [[Centipede]]s make up the class Chilopoda. They are fast, [[predator]]y and [[Venom (poison)|venomous]], hunting mostly at night. There are around 3,300 species, < ref name= " Chapman " / >  ranging from the diminutive ''Nannarup hoffmani'' (less than half an inch in length, {{circa|12}} & nbsp;mm) < ref > {{cite news |url=http://cbc.amnh.org/center/atthecbc/centi/centi.html |title=Central Park survey finds new centipede |date=2003 |publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]] }}{{Dead link|date=October 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  to the giant ''Scolopendra gigantea'', which may exceed {{convert|30|cm|in|0}}. 
 
 ===Millipedes=== 
 [[File:Tachypodoiulus niger 1.jpg|thumb|''Tachypodoiulus niger'', a millipede]] 
 {{main|Millipede}} 
 
 [[Millipede]]s are the class Diplopoda, where most [[segment]]s appear to have two pairs of legs. This happened because each pair of body segments fused (joined) into a single unit, which gives them the appearance of having two pairs of legs per segment. 
 
 They are slower than centipedes, and feed on [[leaf litter]] and [[detritus]]. Around 8,000 species have been described, which may represent less than a tenth of the true global millipede diversity. < ref name= " Chapman " / >  One species, ''Illacme plenipes'' has the greatest number of legs of any animal, with 750. < ref name= " Illacme " / >  Millipedes typically have between 36 and 400 legs. [[Pill millipede]]s are much shorter, and are capable of rolling up into a ball, like [[Armadillidiidae|pillbugs]]. 
 
 ===Symphyla=== 
 [[File:Scutigerella immaculata male.jpg|thumb|''Scutigerella immaculata'', a symphylan]] 
 {{main|Symphyla}} 
 About 200 species of [[symphyla]]ns are known worldwide. < ref name= " Chapman " / >  They resemble centipedes but are smaller and translucent. Many spend their lives as soil [[infauna]], but some live [[arboreal]]ly. Juveniles have six pairs of legs, but, over a lifetime of several years, add an additional pair at each [[ecdysis|moult]] so that the adult [[instar]] has twelve pairs of legs. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://mint.ippc.orst.edu/symphid.htm |title=Garden Symphylans |publisher=Oregon State University |work=Integrated Pest Management on Peppermint-IPMP3.0 |accessdate=July 2, 2007 |archive-date=August 3, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803172418/http://mint.ippc.orst.edu/symphid.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Pauropoda=== 
 [[File:Pauropus huxleyi.jpg|thumb|''[[Pauropus huyxleyi]]'', a pauropod]] 
 {{main|Pauropod}} 
 [[Pauropoda]] is another small group of small myriapods. They are typically 0.5–2.0 & nbsp;mm long and live in the soil on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://animals.jrank.org/pages/2563/Pauropods-Pauropoda.html |title=Pauropods: Pauropoda |work=Insects and Spiders Scientific Reference |accessdate=July 2, 2007}} < /ref >  Over 700 species have been described. < ref name= " Chapman " / >  They are believed to be the [[sister group]] to millipedes, and have the dorsal [[tergite]]s fused across pairs of segments, similar to the more complete fusion of segments seen in millipedes. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.kendall-bioresearch.co.uk/myriapod.htm |title=Pauropods  &  Symphylids |author=David Kendall |date=2005 |publisher=Kendall Bioresearch}} < /ref >
