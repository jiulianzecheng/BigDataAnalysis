 '''Burial''' is the act of placing an object or [[corpse|dead body]] into the ground, specifically a [[grave]]. 
 
 Human bodies are usually buried in a [[cemetery]]. It is common practice in many places to put bodies into a [[coffin]] and place the coffin into the grave. The grave is then usually marked with a [[headstone]] so that people know who has died and can visit them. 
 
 In the past, often during times of [[war]], many bodies have been placed into the same grave without coffins. This is called a ''mass burial'' or a ''[[mass grave]]''.
