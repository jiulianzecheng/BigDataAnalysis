 {{nihongo|'''Bushidō'''|[[wikt:武|武]][[wikt:士|士]][[wikt:道|道]]|Bushidō}}, meaning  " Way of the Warrior " , is a [[Japan]]ese [[code]] of [[conduct]] and a way of life, more or less similar to the [[Europe]]an code of [[chivalry]]. It comes from the [[samurai]] [[moral]] code and gives great importance to certain [[virtue]]s like [[frugality]], [[loyalty]], [[martial arts]] [[wikt:master|mastery]] and [[honour]] until voluntary death, [[seppuku]]. Bushidō was created between the 11th to 14th centuries and took form as a code from the 12th to 16th centuries. 
 
 Under the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], Bushidō became official Japanese Feudal Law. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-erfurt.de/ostasiatische_geschichte/texte/japan/dokumente/17/tokugawa_legislation/index.htm |title=Japanese Feudal Laws John Carey Hall, ''The Tokugawa Legislation'', (Yokohama, 1910), pp. 286-319 |access-date=2007-08-27 |archive-date=2012-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021003115/http://www.uni-erfurt.de/ostasiatische_geschichte/texte/japan/dokumente/17/tokugawa_legislation/index.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 Honor codes are still used in modern times; for example, as part of the [[kamikaze]] beliefs.
