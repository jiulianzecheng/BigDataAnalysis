 '''Buxtehude''' ({{IPA-de|bʊkstəˈhuːdə}}) is a town in Northern Germany. It has 39,000 [[inhabitant]]s. It is by the [[Este]] river which joins the city to the important river [[Elbe]] just {{convert|6|mi|abbr=off|disp=flip}} away. 
 
 Buxtehude is known as  " The Fairytale Capital "  of the world. The tale of  " The Bunny and the Hedgehog "  by the [[Brothers Grimm]] is set in this town. 
 
 The ''Pistennacht'' is an event where bars, restaurants and clubs in the old part of town are open all night long. The ''Pfingstmarkt'' is a big [[fair]] which is held at [[Whitsun]] (Pfingsten). There is a lot to do including rides on a [[Ferris Wheel]]. On the first weekend of June there is a big feast in the old part of the town, which also has a [[wine]] festival every year.
