 An '''''escopetarra''''' is a [[guitar]] made from a [[rifle]]; it is used as a symbol of [[peace]]. The name is a  combination of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words ''escopeta'' (meaning shotgun/rifle) and ''guitarra'' (meaning guitar). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/03/guitar_made_from_ak47_the_esco.html|title=Guitar made from AK-47 - The Escopetarra|last=Torrone|first=Phillip|publisher=MAKE: Technology on Your Time|date=2006-03-11|accessdate=2007-01-31|archive-date=2007-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125133642/http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/03/guitar_made_from_ak47_the_esco.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 ''Escopetarras'' were invented in 2003 by a [[Colombia]]n peace activist named [[Cesar Lopez|César López]]. At a gathering after the [[2003 El Nogal Club bombing|El Nogal Club bombing]] in [[Bogotá]], he noticed a soldier holding a gun like a guitar and got the idea for it. < ref name=bbce > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5033626.stm Colombian musicians organise online], BBC News, 1 June 2006 < /ref >  The first ''escopetarra'' in 2003 was made from a [[Winchester rifle]] and a [[Stratocaster]] electric guitar. < ref > Making music out of menace: A Colombian musician has fashioned guitars out of rifles to help spread a message of peace.

 López made five ''escopetarras'', four of which were given to Colombian musician [[Juanes]], Argentine musician [[Fito Páez]], the [[United Nations Development Program]], and the city  government of [[Bogotá]], while one was kept for himself. Juanes later sold his ''escopetarra'' for US$17,000 at a [[Beverly Hills]] fundraiser held to help victims of [[anti-personnel mine]]s, < ref name= " BBC " > {{cite news|title=Escopetarras: disparando música|last=Latorre|first=Héctor|date=2006-01-24|accessdate=2007-01-31|publisher=BBC World|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/newsid_4644000/4644028.stm}} < /ref >  while the ''escopetarra'' given to the UN was exhibited at the June 2006 of the UN [[Conference on Disarmament]]. < ref > {{cite news|title=La escopeta transformada en guitarra del músico César López será exhibida en la ONU|url=http://www.desarme.org/publique/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=16 & infoid=5025|last=Conte|first=Gabriel|publisher=Desarme.org|date=2006-06-15|accessdate=2007-01-31|archive-date=2007-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095508/http://www.desarme.org/publique/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=16 & infoid=5025|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 In 2006, López got 12 more decommissioned [[AK-47]]s from Colombia's peace commissioner's office. After they are turned into guitars, he plans to give them to popular musicians such as [[Shakira]], [[Carlos Santana]], and [[Paul McCartney]], as well as political figures such as the [[Dalai Lama]]. However, a member of the Dalai Lama's staff rejected López' offer, saying it is not appropriate to give a weapon as a gift; López has said he will try to explain his purpose more clearly. < ref name= " Sites " > {{cite news|last=Sites|first=Kevin|url=http://hotzone.yahoo.com/b/hotzone/blogs3860;_ylt=AtqLBf1cY4xDT9Yr.HLpoSqLFMsF;_ylu=X3oDMTBjM3FjYjBzBHNlYwNibG9nLXN1bQ--|publisher=Yahoo!
