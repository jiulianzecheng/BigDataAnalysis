 In the [[Christianity|Christian religion]], '''Subordinationism''' is a doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. It claims that the [[Christ|Son]] is subordinate to the Father because he is a created being, and because he has a created nature, he is not fully God as the Father is. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FWM1bqkLtQQC & dq=trinity+Subordinationism+Didache & pg=PT119|title=Reading the Early Church Fathers: From the Didache to Nicaea|last=Papandrea|first=James Leonard|date=2012|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-4751-9|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lo42zEOKobwC & dq=Subordinationism & pg=PA232|title=The Eternal Generation of the Son: Maintaining Orthodoxy in Trinitarian Theology|last=Giles|first=Kevin|date=2012-05-07|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-3965-0|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Subordinationism was rejected as heresy at the [[Nicene Creed|Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Subordination of the Spirit, which argued that the Spirit must not have been fully God because of his subordination to the Father and the Son, was a similar issue in 381 and was condemned as heresy in the [[Second Council of Constantinople|second council of Constantinople]]. < ref name= " Origen " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vn6qEg2MwX0C & dq=Origen+subordinationism+condemned & pg=PA6|title=Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, Books 1-5|last=Origen|date=April 2010|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1203-6|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 Subordinationism is different from [[Arianism]]. Subordinationism shares the Nicene-Constantinopolitan view. Unlike Subordinationism, Arianism believes that the Holy Spirit is not a person but rather a supernatural force, and that the Son was not always the Son from the beginning, that there was a time before the Son was begotten, and that the title  " Son "  was just a title he later assumed. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgFLAwAAQBAJ & dq=Subordinationism+and+Arianism & pg=PA107|title=God in Three Persons|last=Beisner|first=E.

 == History == 
 
 === Before the Nicene Creed === 
 According to Badcock, theology experts were Subordinationists at some point. This includes people like [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], [[Justin Martyr]], and [[Novatian]], they believed that God the Father is the only person of the Trinity who is fully God. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahDPz4mFuD8C & dq=trinity+Subordinationism+Didache & pg=PA230|title=Founding the Fathers: Early Church History and Protestant Professors in Nineteenth-Century America|last=Clark|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2011-04-12|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0432-2|language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= " :322 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1sd2j_ILAgC & dq=Novatian & pg=PT5|title=The Sacred Writings of Novatian|last=Novatian|date=2012|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=978-3-8496-2144-5|edition=Annotated|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S17mtJCCr_MC & dq=Subordinationism+Clement+of+Rome & pg=PA59|title=An Introduction to the Trinity|last1=Marmion|first1=Declan|last2=Nieuwenhove|first2=Rik van|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-87952-1|language=en}} < /ref >  Subordinationism can be found in [[Ascension of Isaiah]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWCpAwAAQBAJ & dq=Ascension+of+Isaiah+Subordinationism & pg=PT43|title=Christmas, The Original Story|last=Barker|first=Margaret|date=2011-09-22|publisher=SPCK|isbn=978-0-281-06726-8|language=en}} < /ref >  This was because they valued and admired the Father's supremacy; they believed that a fully divine Son would destroy his supremacy and that sharing this divine essence with more than one person would imply that God is both divisible and changeable. They argued that anyone other than the Father must have been created by the Father and be subordinate to him; they were convinced that the Son was a created being because he was subordinate to him.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} 
 
 === Arius and Alexander === 
 Alexander and Arius had a disagreement that occurred during the Arian Controversy, which started in the year 318 or 319. < ref > {{Cite web|title=A Chronology of the Arian Controversy|url=http://legalhistorysources.com/ChurchHistory220/LectureTwo/ArianControversy.htm|access-date=2021-12-16|website=legalhistorysources.com}} < /ref >  At the beginning, no one knew the exact answer. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-11-26|title=RPC Hanson - A lecture on the Arian Controversy|url=https://revelationbyjesuschrist.com/hanson/|access-date=2021-12-16|website=From Daniel to Revelation|language=en-US}} < /ref >  [[Arius]] (c. 250–336), a priest of [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], had an argument with Alexander, who was the bishop of the church in that city, about his obvious carelessness in blurring the difference of nature between the Father and the Son, as he believed in the eternal Sonship of the Son (that the Son was always the Son since the beginning).

Retrieved 30 November 2015. < /ref > According to Socrates, Arius' view was: < blockquote > “If the Father begat the Son, that would mean that he who was begotten must have had a beginning of existence: and from this it is obvious, that there was a time when the Son ''didn't''. It therefore means that he [the Son] was created with no material but of nothing.” < ref > (Socrates of Constantinople, ''Church History,'' Book I, Ch. 5.) < /ref > < /blockquote > According to Kelly, < ref > [[First Council of Nicaea#CITEREFKelly1978|Kelly 1978]], Chapter 9) ''[[John Norman Davidson Kelly|Kelly, J N D]] (1978), Early Christian Doctrine, San Francisco: HarperCollins, [[ISBN (identifier)|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/978-0-06-064334-8|978-0-06-064334-8]]'', retrieved 24 February 2014 < /ref >  the argument was over whether the Son had a beginning. To make their case, the parties relied on the Son's source of existence. < blockquote > To justify his view that the Son had no beginning, Alexander argued that the Son had been 'begotten' by the Father from his own being. But Arius argued that the Son was created out of nothing, and therefore had a beginning. < /blockquote > While Alexander described the Son as being equal in nature and being to the Father, Arius described Him as being subordinate in nature and being to the Father.
