 '''Neuwerk''' ({{Audio|DE-Neuwerk-GT.ogg|pronunciation}};  (''Old English'': '''New Werk''' < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=a7QBAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA200 The New Seaman's Guide, and Coaster's Companion], Cornhill, 1809 < /ref >  or '''Newark''' < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7BWAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA332 ''Proserpine Frigate & nbsp;– Official Account of the Loss of that Ship'']; a letter addressed by Captain Wallis to Vice Admiral Dickson; Feb 18, 1799;  " The Naval Chronicle " ; January–June 1799; (Bunney  &  Gold, London); pp. 332–335. < /ref > ) is a {{cvt|3|km2|sqmi}} [[tidal island]] in the [[Wadden Sea]] on the [[Germany|German]] [[North Sea]] coast, with a population of 32. Neuwerk is located {{cvt|13|km|0}} northwest of [[Cuxhaven]], between the [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]] estuaries. The distance to the centre of Hamburg is about {{cvt|120|km|-1}}. 
 
 Administratively, Neuwerk forms a [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]] of the city and state of [[Hamburg]], Germany, with the same name. It is part of the borough [[Hamburg-Mitte]]. This quarter includes the islands of [[Scharhörn]] and [[Nigehörn]], which are bird sanctuaries and closed to the public. All three islands and the Wadden Sea around them form the [[Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]].
