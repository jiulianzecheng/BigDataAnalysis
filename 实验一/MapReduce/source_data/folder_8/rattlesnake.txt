 The '''rattlesnake''' is a kind of [[snake]], a [[reptile]]. About 50 [[species]] of rattlesnakes are known: they are a kind of [[pit viper]].  
 
 There are two groups of rattlesnakes: the [[genus|genera]] ''Crotalus'' and ''Sistrurus''. All  have a [[venom]]ous bite, and some are much more dangerous than others. Pit vipers  have a set of heat-sensing  " pits "  on their heads which help them find prey and move towards it, even in the dark. 
 
 The name ''rattlesnake'' is used because they have a special tail with several parts on the end that can make a loud ''bzzzz'' sound, or rattle. This defends them against predators and large animals. It acts as a warning signal.  
 
 Rattlesnakes are [[native (ecology)|native]] to the [[Americas]] from southwest [[Canada]] to central [[Argentina]]. They usually live in dry areas.  They eat small animals such as [[birds]] and [[rodents]]. 
 
 When they are young, many are eaten by birds. When they are adult, they have a particular enemy: the common [[kingsnake]], ''Lampropeltis getula'', a [[colubrid]] snake.
