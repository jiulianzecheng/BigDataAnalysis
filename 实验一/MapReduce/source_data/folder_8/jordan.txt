 [[File:Jo-map.png|right|200px|thumb|A [[map]] of Jordan]]'''Jordan''' (officially the '''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan''') is an [[Arab people|Arab]] country in southwest [[Asia]], in the [[Middle East]], in the southern part of the [[The Levant|Levant]] region, and the northern part of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Jordan has borders with [[Syria]] to the north, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Israel]] to the west, [[Iraq]] to the east, [[Saudi Arabia]] to the east and south, and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to the southwest, where the city of [[Aqaba]] is next to the [[Red Sea]].   
 
 The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Jordan is [[Amman]]. [[Aqaba]] is the only [[Port|sea port]] for Jordan with only 27 kilometers of coastline. Jordan is named after [[Jordan River]], which passes on its western borders. Jordan is a country that combines different Arab cultures and dialects, and no natural borders separate it from its Arab neighbors except the Jordan River which separates Jordan and Palestine as well as the Yarmouk River, which separates Jordan and Syria. As for the rest of the borders, it is an extension of the Levant Badia in the north and east, the Influence Desert in the south, and Wadi Araba to the southwest.   
 
 The terrain in Jordan varies greatly, the most important of which are the [[Ajloun Mountains]] in the northwest, and the [[Shara Mountains]] in the south, the highest peak on [[Umm al-Dami Mountain]] is 1854 meters, and the lowest point in the [[Dead Sea]], which is the lowest point in the world.  
 
 In 1921, Prince [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah bin Al-Hussein]] established the Emirate of [[Transjordan]] with the help of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and it was then subject to British rule in the [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandatory region of Palestine]]. The system in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with a representative government. The king exercises his executive power through the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, who, at the same time, are accountable to the [[House of Representatives (Jordan)|House of Representatives]] (elected) and the [[Senate (Jordan)|Senate]] (appointed by the king) who are the [[Legislature|legislative branch]] of the state. There is also an [[Judiciary|independent judiciary]] system.   
 
 Jordan is a founding member of the [[Arab League|League of Arab States]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of Islamic Cooperation]]. Jordan is a sovereign constitutional monarchy, yet the king enjoys extensive executive and legislative powers.   
 
 Jordan is frequently referred to as an  " oasis of stability "  in a turbulent region, given that it was mostly unaffected by the violence that engulfed the region in 2010. However, the country's population suffers from relatively high rates of unemployment and poverty.  
 
 ==Governorates== 
 {{main|Governorates of Jordan}} 
 Jordan is divided into 12 [[Governorates]].  The governorates are divided into 54 departments or districts named Nahias.
