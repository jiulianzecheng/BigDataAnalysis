 '''Bioplastics''' are [[plastic]] [[Material|materials]] that are made from [[biomass]] sources. These include [[vegetable oil|vegetable fats and oils]], [[corn starch]], [[straw]] and [[food waste]]. Some bioplastics are made directly from [[Biopolymer|natural biopolymers]] such as [[polysaccharide]]s (e.g., [[starch]] and [[cellulose]]) and [[protein]]s (e.g. [[gluten]], and [[gelatin]]). Others are [[Chemical synthesis|chemically synthesised]] from [[sugar]] [[Derivation|derivatives]] and [[lipid]]s. In contrast, common plastics, also called petro-based polymers, are made from [[petroleum]] or [[natural gas]]. 
 
 One good thing about bioplastics is is that they are not made from [[fossil fuel]]. This is good because there is only a limited amount of fossil fuels. They also can not be found everywhere. This leads to [[petroleum politics]] and affects the [[environment]]. Studies show that some bioplastics can be made with a lower [[carbon footprint]]. Other bioplastics' processes are less efficient and cause a higher carbon footprint than fossil plastics. < ref name= " :5 " > {{Cite journal |last1=Rosenboom |first1=Jan-Georg |last2=Langer |first2=Robert |last3=Traverso |first3=Giovanni |date=2022-02-20 |title=Bioplastics for a circular economy |journal=Nature Reviews Materials |language=en |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=117–137 |doi=10.1038/s41578-021-00407-8 |pmid=35075395 |pmc=8771173 |bibcode=2022NatRM...7..117R |issn=2058-8437}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=S. |last2=Rothman |first2=R. |date=2020-07-10 |title=Life cycle assessment of bio-based and fossil-based plastic: A review |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620312051 |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |language=en |volume=261 |page=121158 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121158 |s2cid=216414551 |issn=0959-6526}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal |last1=Pellis |first1=Alessandro |last2=Malinconico |first2=Mario |last3=Guarneri |first3=Alice |last4=Gardossi |first4=Lucia |date=2021-01-25 |title=Renewable polymers and plastics: Performance beyond the green |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678420301813 |journal=New Biotechnology |language=en |volume=60 |pages=146–158 |doi=10.1016/j.nbt.2020.10.003 |pmid=33068793 |s2cid=224321496 |issn=1871-6784}} < /ref >
