 == History == 
 Egyptian Radio began broadcasting on 31 May [[1934]] in agreement with the Marconi Company. The General Manager of the station was Said Basha Lotfi from May 1934 to December 1947. In December 1947, the contract with Marconi was suspended in favour of an Egyptian national broadcasting station. The station is known also for its call  " This is Cairo "  (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] هنا القاهرة pronounced Houna al Qaahira). It is considered the First Program (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] البرنامج الأول) of the ERTU. 
 
 Later on three main new radio channels were added, the pan-Arab The [[Voice of the Arabs]] (صوت العرب) in 1953, Egyptian Radio's Second Programme (البرنامج الثاني) in 1957 and the pan-Arab [[Middle East Radio]] (إذاعة الشرق الأوسط) in 1964. All four stations broadcast on high powered [[medium wave]] transmitters covering most of the Middle East and North and East Africa.
