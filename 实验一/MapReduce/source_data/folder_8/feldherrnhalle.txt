 After the Nazis took power in 1933, Hitler turned the Feldherrnhalle into a memorial to the Nazis killed there. A memorial to the killed men was put up on its east side. It is opposite the location of the shootings. This monument was called the ''Mahnmal der Bewegung''. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/monument-on-the-munich-feldherrnhalle-germany-1936-artist-unknown-image262767153.html|title=Stock Photo - Monument on the Munich Feldherrnhalle, Germany, 1936.

New SS recruits took their oath of [[loyalty]] to Hitler in front of the memorial. 
 
 ==After the war== 
 At the end of the war, the Feldherrnhalle was changed back to how it was earlier. Local people smashed the ''Mahnmal der Bewegung'' to pieces on 3 June 1945. < ref name = gave/ >  In the 1950s, a plan to move Bavaria's memorial to the unknown soldier to the Feldherrnhalle was ended. There was concerns that neo-Nazis would meet at the site. < ref name = gave/ > 
 
 On 25 April 1995, [[Reinhold Elstner]] set himself on fire in front of Feldhernhalle. He did this to protest against  " the ongoing official slander and demonization of the German people and German soldiers " .
