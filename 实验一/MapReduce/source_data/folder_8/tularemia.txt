'''Tularemia''' (also called   " Goblin Fever " ,  " deer-fly fever " ,  " Ohara fever "  and  " Francis disease " ) is a [[disease]]. Usually [[rodent]]s get it.  It is caused by a [[bacterium]], ''[[Francisella]] tularensis''. There have been cases where the disease spread to humans. The disease can be treated with [[antibiotics]]. 
 
 ==Tularemia as a biological weapon== 
 Cases of tularemia should be reported to the local health authority. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] think ''F. tularensis'' could possibly be a [[bioweapons]] agent. For this reason, it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the USA, USSR and Japan at various times. < ref > Dennis DT ''et al.'' (2001) [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/21/2763   " Tularemia as a Biological Weapon: Medical and Public Health Management " ]. ''JAMA'' 285:2763-2773 < /ref >  A former Soviet biological weapons scientist, [[Kenneth Alibek]], has said that an outbreak of Tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the siege of [[Stalingrad]] was due to intentional release of F. tularensis by Soviet forces, but this claim is rejected by others who have studied the outbreak. < ref > Sjostedt, A (2007) [http://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1409.009   " Tularemia: History, Epidemiology, Pathogen Physiology, and Clinical Manifestations. " ]  
 Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1105:1–29 < /ref >  In the USA, practical research into using Tularemia as a [[bioweapon]] took place at [[Camp Detrick]] in the 1950s. It was viewed as an attractive agent because: 
 * it is easy to aerosolize  
 * it is highly infective; 10-50 bacteria are required to infect  
 * it is non-persistent and easy to decontaminate (unlike [[Anthrax (disease)|anthrax]])  
 * it is highly incapacitating to infected persons 
 * it has low lethality, which is useful where enemy soldiers are in proximity to non-combatants, e.g. civilians 
 
 By the late 1950s the US [[biological warfare]] program was focused mostly on tularemia as a biological agent.  The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the M143 bursting spherical bomblet.  It was a lethal biological with an anticipated fatality rate of 40 to 60 percent.  The rate-of-action was around three days, with a duration-of-action of one to three weeks (treated) and two to three months (untreated) with frequent relapses.  UL was streptomycin resistant.  The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern, being sensitive to sun light, and losing virulence over time after release.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} 
 
 The United States later changed the military symbol for UL to TT (wet-type) and ZZ (dry-type) in an effort to retain security on the identity of military biologicals.  When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT (an incapacitant rather than lethal agent), the Schu S4 strain's symbol was changed again to SR.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} 
 
 No [[vaccine]] is available to the general public. < ref > [http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/tularemia.htm Tularemia, NIAID Fact Sheet < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >  The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning rodents or [[lagomorpha|lagomorphs]] (as rabbits), avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources, and wearing long-sleeved clothes and using an [[insect repellent]] to prevent tick bites. 
 
 ==Documented outbreaks== 
 In summer 2000, an outbreak of tularemia in [[Martha's Vineyard]] resulted in one dead person. It brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized ''Francisella tularensis''. Over the following summers, Martha's Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing. < ref > Feldman KA, Enscore R, Lathrop S, et al. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/345/22/1601 Outbreak of primary pneumonic tularemia on Martha's Vineyard]. N Engl J Med 2001;345:1601--6. < /ref >  The research may prove valuable in preventing [[bioterrorism]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. 
 
 An outbreak of tularemia occurred in [[Kosovo]] in 1999-2000. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol8no1/01-0131.htm|title=Tularemia Outbreak Investigation in Kosovo: Case Control and Environmental Studies}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2004, three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with ''F. tularensis'', after apparently failing to follow safety procedures. < ref > {{cite news | author=Smith S | publisher=Boston Globe | title=City tells BU to bolster safety of its medical labs | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/03/29/city_tells_bu_to_bolster_safety_of_its_medical_labs/ | date=2005-03-29 | accessdate=2007-05-09 }} < /ref > 
 
 In 2005, small amounts of ''F. tularensis'' were detected in the Mall area of Washington, DC the morning after an anti-war demonstration on [[September 24]], [[2005]]. Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall. To this date, no cases of tularemia infection have been reported as a result. < ref > {{cite news|author=Dvorak P|date=2005-10-02|title=Health Officials Vigilant for Illness After Sensors Detect Bacteria on Mall: Agent Found as Protests Drew Thousands of Visitors|page=C13|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/01/AR2005100101209.html|quote=A week after six bioterrorism sensors detected the presence of a dangerous bacterium on the Mall, health officials said there are no reports that any of the thousands of people in the nation's capital Sept. 24 have tularemia, the illness that results from exposure to the bacteria.|accessdate=2007-05-08}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2007, a lab of Boston University's Center for Advanced Biomedical Research, where ''F. tularensis'' were being kept for research, was evacuated after smoke set off alarms.  An investigation has later determined that an electrical problem was the culprit, and no bacterial contamination was found. 
 
 In July 2007, an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of [[Castile and León]] and traced to the plague of [[vole]]s infesting the region.
