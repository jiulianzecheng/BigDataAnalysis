 '''Kosher'''  is the name that [[Judaism|Jews]] give to the laws about the kind of [[food]] that they may eat. Their holy books specify certain kinds of food that are all right to eat, and that other kinds should not be eaten.  
 
 The Kosher laws say that products classified as [[meat]] must not be eaten in the same meal with [[dairy]] products. Fish, fruit, and vegetables are considered neutral, called ''pareve'' (pronounced  " PAR-veh " ), and may be eaten with either meat or dairy meals. Jews who  " keep kosher "  have separate utensils for meat and [[dairy]] foods, and wait a number of hours after eating one type of food before eating the other type. 
 
 The meat of some animals may not be eaten at all. Animals whose meat may be eaten must be killed in a special, careful way by a religiously trained slaughterer. Meat that is not fit to eat is called ''treif'' (pronounced TRAYf). 
 
 == Basic rules of Kashrut == 
 === Types of meat and drink === 
 * Land animals that [[Ruminant|chew their cud]] and have a completely split [[Artiodactyl|(cloven) hoof]] may be eaten . This includes [[livestock]] like [[cattle]] and [[sheep]], but not [[pigs]] (which do not chew their cud) or [[camels]] (which do not have completely split hooves). 
 * Animals that eat meat ([[carnivores]] and [[omnivores]]) may not be eaten. This also means that [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] may not be eaten. 
 * Specific [[birds]] (from a list) may not be eaten. This includes ostrich for example. 
 * Fish must have fins and scales. Fish without scales (like [[eel]]s), invertebrates like [[lobster]] and [[shrimp]], and [[seafood|shellfish]] (like [[mussel]]s) are forbidden. 
 * No [[amphibian]]s or [[reptile]]s may be eaten. Examples of these are [[frog]]s. 
 * Most [[insect]]s may not be eaten, with some exceptions like [[locust]]s. 
 * [[Wine]] must be specially made by Jews in order to be Kosher. 
 
 === Preparing food === 
 * The animals need to be killed in a special way. The kosher slaughterer has religious training for this work. 
 * An animal that dies by natural means, or is killed by another animal or a hunter, may not be eaten. 
 * Meat from a [[sick]] animal  may not be eaten. 
 * No [[blood]] may be eaten. All blood needs to be drained from the meat (by soaking and salting it). In eggs, not even eggs with just a spot of blood can be eaten. 
 * Foods made in a factory: manufacturers sometimes label products that have got certification by adding graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known as ''hechsherim''. 
 * A kosher kitchen has separate sets of dishes: one for meat foods, another for dairy foods. 
 * Food may not be cooked during the Sabbath, which in Judaism is called [[Shabbat]].
