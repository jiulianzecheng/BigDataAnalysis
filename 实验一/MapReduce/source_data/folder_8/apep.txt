'''Apep''' in [[Egypt]]ian mythology was an evil demon. He was associated with darkness and chaos. He was often shown as a [[snake]]. 
 
 Apep's name was often incorrectly defined as he who was ''spat out''. It was said that he had been formed by [[Neith]], who had been the goddess of the ancient waters in the [[Ennead]], from a length of spit she had spat at Nu, the god of the ancient waters in the [[Ogdoad]]. Some subsequent commentators speculated that Apep must have been an earlier creator, and chief god, thus explaining why he had so much anger towards Ra. 
 
 It was believed that Ra (the sun) each night passed into [[Duat]] and then battled with Apep, always winning except for certain days in which Ra is momentarily devoured, what the Egyptians saw as an [[eclipse]]. 
 
 Instead of being worshipped he was done the exact opposite and spat upon. Models would be made of wax and clay and then burnt, spat upon, and defaced.  
 
 == Physical Description == 
 Apep was a fifty foot long snake.  He was black, orange, and a little bit green. Apep was very strong. He symbolized darkness, storms, night, the underworld and death. Ramses sixth tomb depicted him, having nine heads, representing the souls he killed. 
 In some depictions he is shown being attacked by a cat. The cat represents [[Bast]], the goddess of cats. [[Bast]] was Ra's 'Guardian', so to speak. Bast's job was to protect [[Ra]] on his trips through the [[Duat]] every night. this is how he became the physical description

 * The asteroid [[99942 Apophis]], an [[Aten]]-class asteroid, is named in its honour, because it was at Level 4 on the [[Torino impact hazard scale]] between [[2004]] and [[2006]].  
 * The name Apophis was given to the first major false god enemy in the sci-fi series [[Stargate SG-1]] 
 * The name Apep Heidemann was given to the major enemy in the [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] Seraphic Feather.  
 * In the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, there is a snake-like Trap Card Monster called 'Embodiment of Apophis'. Considering the original Yu-Gi-Oh!'s Egyptian origins, this befits the context of the card game.
