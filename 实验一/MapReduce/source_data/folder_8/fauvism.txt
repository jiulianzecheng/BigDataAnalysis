 '''Fauvism''' ([[French language|French]] for ''The Wild Beasts'') was the name of a [[modern art]] movement in the early 20th century, led by the painters [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]. The Fauves were a group of French painters who were influenced by the bright colours used by the [[Post-Impressionists]] [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]]. < ref name=elderfield13 > John Elderfield,  The '' " Wild Beasts "  Fauvism and its affinities,'' 1976, [[Museum of Modern Art]], p13 {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}} < /ref > 
 
 The bright colourful style of [[painting]] that they used began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, but the group was only together for three years, 1905–1907. In that time they had three exhibitions together. Their [[influence]] has continued  until the present day, and was adopted or influenced many artists who are not usually thought of as fauvists. [[Aristarkh Lentulov]] is one good example.
