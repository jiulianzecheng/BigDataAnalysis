 " '''Bluebeard''' "  ({{lang-fr|Barbe-bleue}}) is a [[fairy tale]] by [[Charles Perrault]]. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated [[manuscript]] in 1695 titled ''Contes de ma mère l'oye'' ({{lang-en|Tales of Mother Goose}}). The deluxe [[volume]] was intended for Mademoiselle, the 19-year-old [[niece]] of [[Louis XIV]]. It included four other tales by Perrault. < ref > Betts p. xiv < /ref >   " Bluebeard "  was first [[publish]]ed anonymously in January 1697 in [[Paris]] by [[Claude Barbin]] in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]'' ({{lang-en|Stories or Tales of Past Times}}), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. < ref > Betts p. xv < /ref > < ref > Opie p. 21 < /ref >  The tale is about a cruel man who [[murder]]s his [[wife|wives]] so that he will inherit their [[wealth]]. He puts their [[Body|corpses]] in a [[secret]] room opened only by a [[magic]] [[key]]. 
 
 Jacque Barchilon believes the tale is original with Perrault because there are no close antecedants. The [[taboo]] of the forbidden room is found in [[Asian|eastern]] [[literature]], and Barchilon writes that the tale has an  " [[Eastern world|Oriental]] [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/character character] " . He points out that the French associated [[beard]]s with [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[fashion]]s, and early [[illustration]]s depict Bluebeard wearing a [[turban]]-like headdress. < ref > Barchilon pp. 13-4 < /ref > 
 
 [[Medieval]] murderer of children [[Gilles de Rais]] may have been the inspiration for the character of Bluebeard. De Rais was a Marshal of France and [[Joan of Arc]]'s [[military]] companion. His [[victim]]s (mostly young [[boy]]s) were said to number 140. The [[Brittany|Breton]] [[king]] [[Comorre the Cursed]] (c.500 AD) is another candidate. < ref > Opie pp. 104-5 < /ref >  Tales similar to  " Bluebeard "  include  " [[The Fitcher's Bird]] "  by the [[Brothers Grimm]] and the English tale  " [[Mr. Fox]] " . < ref > Opie p. 103 < /ref > 
 
 == Story == 
 A rich man has a blue beard which frightens young women. He has been married several times but no one knows what has happened to his wives. He woos two young sisters in the neighborhood but neither are inclined to consider marriage. He treats them to a lavish time in his country house. The younger sister decides to marry him. Shortly after the [[wedding]] (and before he [[travel]]s to a far land on [[business]]), Bluebeard gives his wife the [[key]]s to his house. One key opens a door to a distant room. He forbids her to enter this room. He leaves and his wife opens the door to the forbidden room. Here she finds Bluebeard's former wives, all dead and lying on a floor covered with blood. She drops the key. It is magic and becomes stained with blood that cannot be washed away. Bluebeard returns. He discovers the blood-stained key and knows his wife has disobeyed his order. He tells her she will take her place among the dead. He grants her a few minutes to pray. She calls her sister Anne and asks her to go to the top of the tower to see if her brothers are on the road. After several tense moments, Anne reports seeing the men approaching. Bluebeard raises a cutlass to decapitate his wife. Her brothers burst into the room. They kill Bluebeard. Their sister is safe.
