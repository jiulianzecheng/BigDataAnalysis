 '''Deforestation''' is when [[forest]]s are destroyed by cutting trees ([[logging]]) and not replanting them.  The most common reason is to clear the land to make [[farm]]s and [[ranch]]es.  They also cut trees for [[firewood]] and [[lumber]] and to make room for [[cities]].  Deforestation destroys the [[habitat]] of many animals, leading to their death.  The loss is more severe in so called primary forests, which are forests that have yet been untouched by humans.  Deforestation also releases [[Carbon sequestration|sequestered carbon]]. 
 
 Restoring trees in deforested places is called [[reforesting]].

 Land has other uses besides [[Forestry|growing trees]].  The biggest uses of land that was once forested are for [[farming]] and [[ranching]].  Some land is also used for roads and buildings, especially in urban area. As the population grows, people need to remove more trees.  They also use the [[wood]] from the trees as [[lumber]] to make buildings and other things, or they burn the trees as [[firewood]]. 
 
 Forests do these things:  < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.nobledatum.com/portfolio/deforestation-around-the-world/|title=Deforestation Around The World -|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US|archive-date=2017-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212193326/http://www.nobledatum.com/portfolio/deforestation-around-the-world/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 Forests are often planted to protect against [[natural disaster]]s.  When forests are lost, very often the soil they protected is also lost. This loss of soil is called [[erosion]]. 
 
 Trees are also important for [[carbon sequestration]].  When the trees burn or rot, the carbon in them returns to the atmosphere in the form of [[carbon dioxide]]. Since carbon dioxide is a [[greenhouse gas]], deforestation causes global warming.  Tropical deforestation is responsible for about 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/deforestation/|title=Fondation Chirac  & raquo; Deforestation and desertification}} < /ref >  Deforestation continues. < ref name= " Eureka " > {{cite press release|author=International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis|title=Why are we still failing to stop deforestation?|date=May 25, 2020|publisher=Eurekalert.org|accessdate=May 26, 2020|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-05/iifa-waw052520.php}} < /ref > < ref name= " OneE " > {{cite journal|journal=One Earth
