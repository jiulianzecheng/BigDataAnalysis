In [[professional wrestling]], something that is ''' " kayfabe " ''' is not [[real]], something that is  " acted out "  and not happening in real [[life]]. Many things in wrestling are kayfabe, that is, they appear to be real (such as the storylines), but are fake. 
 
 People who believe that kayfabe acts are real are called [[mark (professional wrestling)|mark]]s, as opposed to [[Smark (professional wrestling)|smarks]]. Those who know wrestling is scripted but still enjoy the storylines are known as smart-marks, or smarks. 
 
 It is unknown where the term came from; it is sometimes believed that the term  " kayfabe "  is a modification of the [[Pig latin]] word for  " fake " ,  " akefay " .
