 A '''''Morpho''''' is a [[butterfly]] in one of over 29 [[species]] and 147 [[subspecies]] in the [[genus]] ''Morpho''. 
 
 Morphos are [[Neotropic]]al butterflies found mostly in [[South America]], [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. < ref > Le Moult E.  &  Réal P. 1962–1963. ''Les Morpho d'Amérique du Sud et Centrale'', Editions du cabinet entomologique E. Le Moult, Paris. < /ref >  Morphos range in wingspan from the 7.5 & nbsp;cm (3 & nbsp;inch) ''[[Morpho rhodopteron|M. rhodopteron]]'' to the imposing 20 & nbsp;cm (8 & nbsp;inch) [[Sunset Morpho]], ''M. hecuba''. 
 
 == Colours == 
 Many Morpho butterflies are coloured in metallic, shimmering shades of [[blue]] and [[green]]. These colours are not caused by [[pigment]]. They are an example of [[iridescence]]: light reflects through the microscopic scales covering the Morpho's wings. < ref > {{cite journal |author=P.

 === Sexual dimorphism === 
 The blue Morpho species have [[sexual dimorphism]]. In some species only the males are iridescent blue, the females are [[camouflage]]d brown and yellow. In other species the females are partially iridescent but less blue than the males. 
 
 == Biology == 
 [[Image:Atlantic Forest.jpg|thumb|250px|Atlantic Forest in Paraguay]] 
 
 === Habitat === 
 Their [[habitat]] is the primary forests of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Atlantic]]. They can  breed in other forested habitats, for instance the dry deciduous woodlands of [[Nicaragua]] and in secondary forests. 
 
 === Flight === 
 Morphos are strong fliers, found at altitudes between sea level and about 1400 & nbsp;m. Morphos are [[diurnal]]: males spend the mornings patrolling along forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and will chase any rivals. Morphos typically live alone out of the mating season. 
 
 === Protection === 
 The adults are usually palatable, but hard to catch because they are such strong fliers. Birds find it very hard to catch them. < ref > Young A.M. 1971. Wing colouration and reflectance in ''Morpho'' butterflies as related to reproductive behaviour and escape from avian predators. ''Oecologia'' '''7''', 209 & ndash;222. < /ref > 
 
 The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most ''Morpho'' species may be a case of Müllerian mimicry, < ref name= " pinheiro " > Pinheiro, Carlos E.G. 1996. Palatability and escaping ability in Neotropical butterflies: tests with wild kingbirds (''Tyrannus melancholicus'', Tyrannidae). ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''59'''(4): 351–365.

This means the bird learns that the colour says, in effect,  " don't waste your energy, you can't catch me " . < ref > Edmunds M. 1974. ''Defence in animals: a survey of anti-predator defences''.

 === Life cycle === 
 The entire life cycle of the Morpho butterfly, from egg to death, is approximately 115 days.

 Although the adults are palatable, the larvae are not. Their hairs are irritating, and when disturbed they secrete a [[wikt:noxious|noxious]] fluid which smells like rancid butter. The strong odour is a defence against predators. 
 
 The caterpillar will molt five times before entering the [[pupa|pupal stage]]. The bulbous chrysalis is pale-green or jade-green and emits a repulsive, ultrasonic sound when touched. < ref > Greg Nussbaum [https://web.archive.org/web/20080629022501/http://www.mrnussbaum.com/bluemorpho.htm Blue Morpho] < /ref >  It is suspended from a stem or leaf of the foodplant.
