 The '''oystercatcher''' is a [[species]] of [[bird]] that lives around [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. They usually eat [[shellfish]]es that are found on [[beach]]es and [[mud]]. The Eurasian Oystercatcher uses its sharp bill to open the shells of [[oyster]]s and [[mussel]]s. It cuts the [[muscle]] between the two halves of the shell together, or it crashes the shell against a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and eats the oyster inside. < ref > {{cite book |title= Creatures of the air and sea|author= Brinkley, Edward S. |year= 2000|publisher= Reader's Digest Children's Books|location= Singapore|isbn= 0-7944-0353-0|pages= 36, 37}} < /ref > 
 
 == Lifestyle and adaptations == 
 The oystercatcher has the heaviest bill (= [[beak]]) of any living [[wader]]. < ref name=Darren > Naish, Darren 2010. ''Tetrapod zoology, book one''. 2nd ed, CFZ Press, p208. {{ISBN|978-1-905723-61-4}}. website [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/] < /ref >  They have  " resource [[polymorphism]] " : < ref > Sk√∫lason S.  &  Smith T.B. 1995. Resource polymorphism in vertebrates. ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''. 10, 366{{ndash}}370. < /ref >  they have some different beak types, and each type is used for a different kind of feeding. < ref name=Darren/ >  Unusually, the polymorphism is not genetically determined. It seems individuals are able to change their beak to suit their food. They do, of course, inherit an ability to adapt their feeding behaviour. 
 
 " Stabbers "  work by jabbing their bill tips between the valves of a [[mussel]]'s shell.  " Hammerers "  open mussel shells by banging down on them; some hammerers only break the dorsal side, others only break the ventral side. Still others feed on worms, and they have narrow, tweezer-like bill tips. < ref name=Darren/ > 
 
 The bird's bills grow at 0.4 & nbsp;mm per day, which is four times as fast as human fingernails. Individuals forced to switch from mussel-eating to worm-eating were able to change their bill shape in 10 days. < ref name=Darren/ > 
 
 With bills like that, oystercatchers are dangerous opponents for other birds. They can fight off predators, and often raid other birds to steal their catches.  " They attack other birds at an average of five-minute intervals during low tide " . < ref > Hammond N.  &  Pearson B. 1994. ''Waders''. London: Hamlyn. < /ref >  They get as much as 60% of their food by theft. 
 
 Oystercatchers may live to 35 years. < ref name=Darren/ >
