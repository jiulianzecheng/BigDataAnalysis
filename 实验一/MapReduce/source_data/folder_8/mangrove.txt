 '''Mangroves''' are [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s that grow in [[salt]]y water in hot places like the [[tropic]]s. 
 
 Mangroves make a special saltwater [[wood]]land or [[shrub]]land [[habitat]], called a ''mangrove swamp'', ''mangrove forest'', ''mangrove'' or ''mangal''. < ref > Hogarth, Peter J. 1999.

 Their twisted, tangled roots collect [[sediment]]. Over time, the sediment may become islands, or extend the shoreline. 
 
 == Description == 
 Mangroves live right in the sea, or at the sea edge. Their seeds fall from the [[tree]] and grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of [[soil]]. During low tide, they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fall. If the water level is high, they may be carried far away from where they fell.  
 
 Mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island. As [[soil]] and other things collect in their roots, little bodies of land are formed â€“ just the right place for other island [[plant|vegetation]] to grow. < ref name=fish/ >  This is an example of [[seed dispersal]] by water. 
 
 Mangroves have special root-like structures. They are [[aerial root]]s or ''pneumatophores''. These stick up out of the soil, and are covered in [[lenticel]]s. They take in [[oxygen]] through their pores. These  " breathing tubes "  may reach heights of up to 30 cm, and in some species, over 3 m. Smaller roots with air passages move [[oxygen]] from the air to parts of the plant underwater.  
 
 == Benefits == 
 Mangrove roots give clear water to the [[coral reef]]s which often surround them. They trap dirt and clean water by [[filter]]ing land runoff and removing [[pollution|pollutants]]. The tree also protects the shoreline (and the coral reefs) from being [[eroded]] by storm waves. Mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral-reef [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[crab]]s to grow. < ref name=Att > Attenborough, David 1995.
