 A '''bayonet''' (from [[French language|French]] ''ba√Øonnette'') is a [[knife]]- or [[dagger]]-shaped [[weapon]]. It is designed to be attached to a [[rifle]] barrel or similar weapon. This will turn the gun into a [[spear]]. It is a close-combat or last-resort weapon.

 [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century]] [[military tactics]] included the use of a bayonet fixed on the [[infantry]]man's [[musket]]. < ref name= " COLD " > ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A847532 Cold Steel - The History of the Bayonet]'',  BBC News, 18 November 2002, retrieved 29 July 2011 < /ref >  These were used with massed [[Military formation|troop formations]]. One of the more notable of these was the ''[[charge (warfare)|bayonet charge]]''. This was an attack by a formation of infantrymen with fixed bayonets, usually over short distances. It was to overrun enemy strong points, capture artillery batteries, or break up enemy troop formations. 
 
 With the use of the bayonet, the [[pike]] was no longer used because infantry could now defend themselves from cavalry without sacrificing firepower per man. The Russian Army used the bayonet frequently during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. A Russian saying coined by Russian General [[Alexander Suvorov]] was  " The bullet is foolish, the bayonet wise " . < ref name=Hart18 > Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart, ''The Soviet Army'' (London: Weidenfeld  &  Nicolson, 1957), p. 18 < /ref >  Given Russia's often poorly trained armies and inaccurate [[smoothbore]] muskets, Russian officers preferred to use the bayonet charge instead of musket volley fire where possible. < ref name=Hart18/ >
