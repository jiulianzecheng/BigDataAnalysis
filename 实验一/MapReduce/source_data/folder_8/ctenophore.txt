 The phylum '''Ctenophora''', < ref > pronounced  " Teenofora " < /ref >  the '''comb jellies''', is a [[phylum]] of marine invertebrates. They are part of the [[plankton]], and there are also [[pelagic]] species. The phylum includes the sea gooseberry (''Pleurobrachia pileus'') and Venus' girdle (''Cestum veneris''). 
 
 The phylum was grouped with [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish) in the former [[Coelenterata]] phylum. Ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals. < ref name=class > Dunn ''et al.'' 2008.  " Broad phylogenomic sampling improves resolution of the animal tree of life " . ''Nature'' 06614. < /ref >    
 
 Even though they look like [[jellyfish]], they are zoologically not related to them. They lack the characteristic [[nematocyst]]s (stinging cells), but have ''colloblasts'', sticky cells that snare small victims. They have eight rows of [[cilia]] which look like the teeth of a comb, hence Ctenophore = comb-bearer. Ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervous 
 system. There are about 150 described [[species]] of ctenophora spread throughout the world's oceans, from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea.  
 
 Although there are a few [[benthic]] species, most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic [[biomass]] worldwide. A few species, such as the sea gooseberry, native to the [[North Sea]], have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen's nets, while of other species only a few examples are known. The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult. For this reason their lifespan is not known, but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age. 
 
 == Colour and light == 
 Many planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect, which is not caused by [[bioluminescence]] but by ''diffraction'', the scattering of light, as the cilia on the combs beat. < ref name= " Mills " > Mills, Claudia E. 2009.
