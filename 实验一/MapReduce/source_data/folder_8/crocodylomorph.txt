 The '''Crocodylomorphs''' are an important group of [[archosaur]]s. It includes the [[crocodilia]]ns and their extinct relatives. They were the only members of [[Pseudosuchia]] to survive the end-Triassic extinction. 
 
 During [[Mesozoic]] and early [[Tertiary]] times the Crocodylomorphs were much more diverse than they are now.   
 
 They were originally small, lightly built, active land animals.  These were replaced during the early [[Jurassic]] by various [[aquatic]] and [[Marine biology|marine]] forms. The later Jurassic, [[Cretaceous]], and [[Tertiary]] saw a wide diversity of terrestrial and semi-aquatic lines.  
 
 Modern crocodilians do not appear until the [[Upper Cretaceous]].

 The crocodylian lineage (clade [[Crurotarsi]]) were a very diverse group of reptiles. Not only are they an ancient group of animals, at least as old as the [[dinosaur]]s, they also evolved into a great variety of forms. < ref > Nesbitt S.J. 2011.

 The earliest forms, the [[sphenosuchia]]ns, evolved during the [[Upper Triassic]]. They were slim land animals built like [[greyhound]]s. During the [[Jurassic]] and the [[Cretaceous]], [[Ocean|marine]] forms evolved forelimbs that were paddle-like and had a tail similar to modern fish.  
 
 The group had a wider range of habitats and behaviours than it does at present. ''Dakosaurus andiniensis'', a species closely related to ''Metriorhynchus'', had a skull adapted for eating large marine reptiles.  Several terrestrial species during the [[Cretaceous]] evolved [[Herbivore|herbivory]]. A number of lines during the [[Tertiary]] and [[Pleistocene]] became wholly land predators.
