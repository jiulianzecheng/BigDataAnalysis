An '''ideology''' is a collection of [[idea]]s or [[belief]]s shared by a group of [[person|people]]. It may be a connected set of  ideas, or a style of thought, or a world-view. It was coined by a French philosopher, Destutt de Tracy in 1801/5. < ref > Daniel Bell, in Bullock A.  &  Trombley S. 1999. ''The new Fontana dictionary of modern thought''. London: HarperCollins, p414. ISBN 0-00-255871-8 < /ref > 
 
 There are two main types of ideologies: ''political ideologies'', and ''epistemological ideologies''. Political ideologies are sets of [[ethics|ethical]] [[idea]]s about how a [[country]] should be run. Epistemological ideologies are sets of ideas about the [[philosophy]], the [[Universe]], and how people should make decisions. 
 
 There are many different types of ideologies. [[Communism]], [[socialism]], and [[capitalism]] are  political/[[economics|economical]] ideologies. 
 
 Many [[political party|political parties]] base their political action and program on an ideology. In [[social studies]], a political ideology is a certain [[Ethics|ethical]] set of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myth]]s, or [[symbol]]s of a [[trend|social movement]], [[institution]], or [[social class|class]] which explains how society should work. It offers a political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends it should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. 
 
 Political ideologies have two dimensions: 
 # ''Goals'': how society should work (or be arranged). 
 # ''Methods'': the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement. 
 
 An ideology is a collection of ideas. Typically, each ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers to be the best [[form of government]] (e.g. [[democracy]], [[theocracy]], etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance,  " socialism "  may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology which supports that economic system. 
 
 Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though this is very often controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g. [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana|legalization of marijuana]]).  
 
 Today, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age, < ref > Bell D. 2000. ''The end of ideology: on the exhaustion of political ideas in the fifties''. 2nd ed, Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, p393. < /ref >  in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed. This is often associated with [[Francis Fukuyama|Francis Fukuyama's]] writings on  " the end of history " . < ref > Fukuyama F. 1992. ''The end of history and the last man''. New York: The Free Press, xi. < /ref >
