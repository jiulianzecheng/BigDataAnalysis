 An '''autodidact''' is a person who [[Learning|learns]] to do something by himself or herself. Often they learn things by [[reading]] about it, or by copying someone else. 
 
 Many great people taught themselves when there was no formal teaching in the topics which interested them. Examples are [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michael Faraday]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. Much of the [[industrial revolution]] was done by men in a field of work where there was no previous experience. [[James Watt]] was a [[surveyor]] and [[instrument]] maker and is described as being  " largely self-educated " . < ref > {{cite book |title=Partners in science: letters of James Watt and Joseph Black|last1=Robinson|first1= Eric|last2=McKie|first2= Doublas|year= |publisher =|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn= |pages=4}} < /ref >  Watt, like some other autodidacts of his  time, became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and a member of the [[Lunar Society]]. 
 
 Autodidactism is only one way to learn, and may be done together with formal education. Many autodidacts seek instruction and guidance from experts, friends, teachers, tutors, parents, siblings, and the community.
