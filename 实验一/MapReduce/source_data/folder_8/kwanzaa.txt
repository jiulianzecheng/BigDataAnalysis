 ==History and name of the holiday== 
 Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage.  
 
 The name Kwanzaa comes from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase ''matunda ya kwanza'', meaning first fruits of the harvest. < ref name= " scott " > Megan K. Scott,  " [http://www.buffalonews.com/260/story/897568.html Kwanzaa celebrations continue, but boom is over] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220052310/http://www.buffalonews.com/260/story/897568.html |date=2009-12-20 }} " , ''Buffalo News,'' 17 December 2009. Retrieved 25 December 2009. < /ref >   
 
 During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to [[Christmas]], that [[Jesus]] was psychotic, and that [[Christianity]] was a white religion that black people should shun. < ref name= " karenga1967 " > {{cite book

 }} < /ref >  However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 ''Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture'',  " Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday. " < ref > J.

 ==Principles and symbols== 
 [[File:Kwanzaa Candles-Kinara.svg|thumb|right|Seven candles in a candle holder are symbols of the seven ideas of Kwanzaa]] 
 Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or ''Nguzo Saba'' (originally ''Nguzu Saba''—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this  " is a [[communitarian]] African philosophy, "  . It consists of what Karenga called  " the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world. "  These seven principles comprise ''[[Kawaida]]'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term for [[tradition]] and [[reason]]. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows: 
 
 *''Umoja''  (Unity): To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race. 
 *''Kujichagulia''  (Self-Determination): To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves. 
 *''Ujima'' (Collective Work and Responsibility): To build and maintain our community together. To make our brothers' and sisters' problems our problems, and to solve them together. 
 *''Ujamaa'' ([[Cooperative economics|Cooperative Economics]]): To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together. 
 *''Nia''  (Purpose): To make our collective goal the building and developing of our community. This in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness. 
 *''Kuumba'' (Creativity): To do always as much as we can, in the way we can. This so that we can leave our community more beautiful and better than we inherited it. 
 *''Imani'' (Faith): To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.

 Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, [[corn]] and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a [[kinara]], a communal cup for pouring [[libation]]s, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles. < ref name= " Symbols " > {{cite web

 During Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as [[kente]], especially the wearing of [[Wrapper (clothing)|kaftans]] by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. [[Libations]] are shared, generally with a common [[chalice]] (''a shared cup''), ''Kikombe cha Umoja'', passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the [[Pan-African colors]], a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast ([[Karamu (feast)|Karamu]]).
