The '''weekend''' is a time when fewer [[wikt:people|people]] go to [[Employment|work]] or [[school]]. Traditional [[Christians]] believe that [[Sunday]] is a day of rest or [[Sabbath]], and [[Jew]]s believe the [[Shabbat|day of rest]] is the seventh day, [[Saturday]], and start the week with Sunday. [[Friday]] is also considered the beginning of the weekend, and it is a day of rest for [[Muslim]]s.
