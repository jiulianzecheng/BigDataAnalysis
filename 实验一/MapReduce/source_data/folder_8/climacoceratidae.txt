 '''Climacoceratide''' is a family of [[artiodactyl]]s which lived in [[Miocene]] in [[Africa]]. They're closely related to [[Giraffidae|giraffes]], with some genera, like ''[[Prolibytherium]]'' previously classified as giraffes. 
 
 The climacoceratids, named after one of their members, ''[[Climacoceras]]'', were previously placed in the family [[Palaeomerycidae]], then in [[Giraffidae]]. In 1978, [[W.D. Hamilton]] made a new family, placing it near Giraffidae in the superfamily [[Giraffoidea]]. 
 
 They differ from giraffes as their [[ossicone]]s are from different bones.
