[[File:Flag of Sindhudesh.svg|thumb|Flag of the movement]] 
 '''Sindu desh''' (or '''Sindhudesh''')  is the idea that the region of [[Sindh]] should have more [[autonomy]] from [[Pakistan]]. People who support the idea either want a state that is totally independent from Pakistan, or that is still part of Pakistan, but has more autonomy.  
 ==Origin== 
 The first who proposed this was  Ghulam Murtaza Syed (1904-1995). At first, Syed liked the idea of Pakistan, a state for all Muslims. Later he joined the opposition; he thought that the Pakistani government betrayed the inhabitants of Sindh. In 1971, there was a [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war]], that ended with East Pakistan becoming independent (and calling itself [[Bangladesh]]). After that war, Syed put forward his proposal of an independent Sindh, which he called Sindhudesh. Even though the movement exists, it wasn't able to gather a huge following. This is partly due to how the state of Pakistan is organised.  
 ==Protests== 
 There were protests however: These focused on the use of [[Urdu]], instead of the [[Sindhi language]]. They also protested against the dominance of [[Bhan chod]]. These people were Indian Muslims, who emigrated to Pakistan. They mostly speak Urdu.
