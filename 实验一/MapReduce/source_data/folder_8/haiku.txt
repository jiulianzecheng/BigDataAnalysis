'''{{nihongo|Haiku|俳句}}''' is a type of [[Japan]]ese [[poetry]]. Previously called ''hokku'', haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer [[Masaoka Shiki]] at the end of the [[19th century]]. 
 
 The traditional hokku usually was written in six verses or more or less 5, 7, 5 [[syllable]]s and they had to follow (''on-ji'').  The Japanese word ''cow'', meaning  " sound " , corresponds to a ''mora'', a [[phonetics|phonetic]] unit similar but not identical to the syllable of a language such as [[English language|English]].  A haiku has a special ''season word'' (the ''kigo'') to represent the season in which the poem is set, or a reference to the [[nature|natural]] world. 
 
 Haiku usually breaks in three parts, called ''kireji'', normally placed at the end of the first five or second seven ''morae''. In Japanese, there are actual kireji words. In English, kireji is often replaced with commas, hyphens, elipses, or breaks in the haiku. Japanese haiku are normally written in one line, while English language haiku are traditionally separated into three lines. 
 
 In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[noun]]s do not have different [[singular]] and [[plural]] forms, so  " haiku "  is used as both a singular and plural noun in [[English language|English]] as well. 
 
 == Examples == 
 Japanese hokku and haiku are traditionally printed in one vertical line. 
 
 * An example of classic hokku by poet Bashō: 
 :古池や蛙飛込む水の音　 
 :''Furu ike ya kawazu tobikomu mizu no oto'' 
 :An old pond 
 :When the frogs jump in 
 :The sound of water 
 
 * Another haiku by Bashō: 
 :初しぐれ猿も小蓑をほしげ也 
 :''Hatsu shigure saru mo komino wo hoshige nari'' 
 :The first cold shower; 
 :Even the monkey seems to want 
 :A little coat of straw. 
 :([[Coat]]s and [[straw]] hats were normally used in Japan to protect from rain at the time)
