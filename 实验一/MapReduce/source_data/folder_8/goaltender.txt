 The '''goaltender''' (also known [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as '''goalie''' or '''netminder''') in [[ice hockey]] is the player who defends his team's goal net by stopping [[shot (hockey)|shots]] of the [[hockey puck|puck]] from entering his team's net, thus stopping the other team from [[score|scoring]]. They usually stay close to the net. 
 
 At the very end of a game, if a team is losing by one goal, teams may take their goaltender out of the game and replace him with another player. This makes it more likely that they will score a goal, however, it is also much easier for the other team to score without anybody defending the goal.
