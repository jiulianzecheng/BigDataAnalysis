 A '''surcoat''', or '''surcote''', was an outer [[:wikt:garment|garment]] commonly worn in the [[Middle Ages]] by men. About 100 years later, women started to wear surcoats. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~marc-carlson/cloth/glossary.html |title=Glossary of some medieval clothing terms |author=I.

 Starting about the 12th century, [[knight]]s wore long and [[:wikt:flowing|flowing]] surcoats over their armour. < ref name=Meller77 > Walter Clifford Meller, ''A Knight's Life in the Days of Chivalry'' (Kila, MT: Kessinger Pub., 2005), p. 77 < /ref >  They would often show the [[coat of arms]] of the wearer. A knight's surcoat reached almost to the [[:wikt:ankles|ankles]]. < ref name=Meller77/ >  It had slits (cuts) in the bottom front and back so a wearer could sit. It also had no [[:wikt:sleeves|sleeves]]. < ref name=Meller77/ >  One purpose for the surcoat was to protect armour from the rain. < ref name=Meller77/ >  Another use was during the [[Crusades]] to keep the armour cooler in the sun. < ref name=Meller77/ > 
 
 By the middle of the 14th century the long surcoat was replaced with the  " Jupon "  (or  " Gipon " ). This was a much shorter garment, which was often padded for extra [[:wikt:protection|protection]]. < ref > E. Farr, et al., ''The National History of England'', Vol 1 (London; Glasgow: William Collins, Sons  &  Company, 1873), p. 386 < /ref >  Once suits of plate (solid) armour became common, the surcoat was no longer used.
