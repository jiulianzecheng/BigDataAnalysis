 He was a soldier who worked for the [[general]] < nowiki/ > s [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] and his son [[Aspar]] for fifteen years. When the emperor [[Theodosius II]] died on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a [[candidate]] to be emperor by Aspar. Aspar had power because he controlled the [[Roman army]]. 
 
 After a month of [[negotiation]], [[Pulcheria]], Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], a man with almost as much power as Aspar, may have been part of these negotiations. Zeno got the high [[title]] of {{lang|la|[[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patrician]]}} after Marcian became emperor, perhaps as a [[reward]]. Marcian was [[inaugurated]] as Emperor on 25 August 450. 
 
 Marcian undid many of the acts of Theodosius{{nbsp}}II in the Romans' relations with the [[Huns]] (led by [[Attila]]) and in the organization of the [[Christian Church]]. Marcian soon broke all [[treaties]] with Attila, ending all [[subsidy]] payments to him. In 452, while Attila and the Huns were attacking the [[Italian Peninsula]] (part of the [[western Roman Empire]]), Marcian's armies attacked across the [[Danube]] river into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. There the Roman armies overcame the Huns in their own country. Because of this, and because of a [[famine]] and [[epidemic]] in [[northern Italy]], the western Roman Empire was able to [[bribe]] Attila into [[Retreat|retreating]] from the Italian Peninsula. 
 
 When Attila died in 453, it was the downfall of the Huns' power. Marcian improved the Romans' position by allowing [[Germanic peoples]] to live in Roman lands as [[Alliance|allies]]. They did military service in exchange for this [[right]]. Marcian called together the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which agreed that [[Jesus]] had two  " natures " : [[divine]] and [[human]]. This made the populations of [[Roman Syria]] and [[Roman Egypt]] Marcian's enemies. People in these places did not agree with this official [[Christology]].  
 
 Marcian died on 26 January 457. At the end of Marcian's life, the Empire's [[treasury]] was full of money. There were seven million more gold coins than were needed, even though the cost of the wars and treaties with the Huns had been high. After Marcian died, Aspar decided against Marcian's son-in-law [[Anthemius]] being emperor. Aspar used his power to make [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo & nbsp;I]] emperor. < ref > Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin; Martindale J.R.; Morris J. 1980. ''The Prosopography of the later Roman Empire''.
