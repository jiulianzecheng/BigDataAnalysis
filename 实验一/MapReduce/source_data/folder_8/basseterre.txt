 '''Basseterre''' {{IPAc-en|b|æ|s|ˈ|t|ɛər}}, is the [[capital (city)|capital]] city of the Federation of [[Saint Christopher and Nevis]], also called St Kitts and Nevis, in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. ''Basseterre'' port is at {{Coord|17|18|N|62|44|W|display=inline}}, on the south western coast of [[Saint Kitts]] Island.  It is one of the chief commercial depots of the [[Leeward Islands]]. The city is in the parish of [[Saint George Basseterre Parish|Saint George Basseterre]] and the southern part of the parish of [[Saint Peter Basseterre Parish|Saint Peter Basseterre]].  In 2000 about 15,500 people lived in the city. 
 
 Basseterre is one of the oldest towns in the [[Lesser Antilles|Eastern Caribbean]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Basseterre.jpeg|left|thumb|240px|Panoramic View of the City of Basseterre from Zante, looking North.]] 
 Basseterre was founded in 1627 by the [[French people|French]], under [[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]]. It was the capital of the French colony of Saint-Christophe.  The colony was the most northern and most southern parts of the island of St. Kitts. The middle part was held by Britain. When [[Phillipe de Longviliers de Poincy]] was made the French governor of St. Kitts in 1639, the town turned into a large, successful port, commanding Eastern Caribbean trade and colonisation. De Poincy then quickly made Basseterre capital of the entire French West Indies colony, which included the islands of [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]]. It was the capital until his death in 1660. The city was made capital of the entire island of St. Kitts in 1727. This is when the French were pushed off the island and the [[British people|British]] took full control. 
 
 The city of Basseterre has one of the most tragic histories of any Caribbean capital, destroyed many times by colonial wars, fire, earthquakes, floods, riots and hurricanes. Despite all of this, a large number of well-restored buildings still exist in downtown Basseterre. 
 
 ==Geographical Setting and Climate== 
 ===Geography=== 
 The city of Basseterre is on a {{convert|2|mi|km}} bay on the southwestern shore of St. Kitts, Basseterre Bay. The city is in the large [[Basseterre Valley]], almost completely surrounded by lush green hills and mountains. It is mostly low-lying, which is one explanation for the name which the French gave it, Basseterre {{lang-en|low land}}. However, the name Basseterre is also due to the fact that the island is on the lee of winds of the island, and is thus a safe anchorage. The name Capesterre, given to the region to the North, was dubbed so as it was facing the wind. Basseterre is surrounded by the [[Olivees Mountains]] to the north and the [[Conaree-Morne]] peaks to the east. The city is drained by the [[College Rive]]r and the [[Westbourne River]], which are locally known as  " ghauts "  and are dry most of the year. They even form streets in downtown Basseterre. This engineering folly has proven quite disastrous though, as College River has been the scene of many disastrous [[:File:St_Kitt_flood_1880.pdf|floods]] in Basseterre history. Port Zante, in the centre of the bay, is on {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land reclaimed from the sea in 1995. 
 
 ===Climate=== 
 Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Basseterre features a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. Temperatures remain constant throughout the course of the year, 27 & nbsp;°C year-round.  Basseterre has no [[dry season]]; all 12 months on average sees more than {{convert|6|cm|in}} of precipitation. On average, {{convert|17|cm|in}} of rain falls on the city annually.
