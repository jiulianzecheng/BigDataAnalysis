 A '''curve''' is a [[line]] that [[wikt:turn|turn]]s or [[wikt:bend|bend]]s. A curved line is never [[straight]], and a curved [[surface]] is a surface that is never [[flat]]. Some curves can be drawn on paper, but some curves, like a [[helix]], can only be seen in [[3-D]]. A [[circle]] is a curve that can be described with the [[formula]] ''x'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  + ''y'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  = ''r'' < sup > 2 < /sup > . ''x'' and ''y'' are used as in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], and ''r'' is the [[radius]] of the circle (distance from the center to the outside). Many other curves can also be described with a formula like that.
