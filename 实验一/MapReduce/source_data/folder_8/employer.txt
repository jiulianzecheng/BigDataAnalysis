 An '''employer''' is a person or institution that hires [[employee]]s.  Employers offer [[pay|wage]]s or a [[salary]] to the workers in exchange for the worker's [[Employment|work]] or [[Labour (economics)|labor]]. 
 
 If the employee is paid by the hour, then the money the employee earns is called their wage. If the employee is paid a set rate per pay period, then the money they earn is called their salary. Wages are paid for all hours worked, including [[overtime]], but a salary is typically not paid more for more hours worked than the minimum. 
 
 Employers include everything from people hiring a [[babysitter]] to [[government]]s and [[business]]es which may hire many thousands of employees.  In most western societies governments are the largest single employers, but most of the work force is employed in small and medium [[business]]es in the [[private sector]].
