 Most movies are made so they can be [[Observation|watched]] at home or on a [[movie screen]] at [[movie theater]]s. Movies are shown in movie theaters a few weeks or months after or before the movie is [[Movie release|released]]. Movies can be [[Marketing|marketed]] using [[Media (communication)|media]]. Movies are shown on [[pay television]] or [[cable television]], or are [[Sales|sold]] or [[Renting|rented]] on [[DVD]] disks or [[videocassette]] tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. Movies can also be [[download]]ed or [[Streaming media|streamed]]. Some movies are shown on television [[broadcasting]] stations.

 Movies are [[Cinematography|filmed]] with [[movie camera]]s or [[video camera]]s. Movie cameras take [[picture]]s very quickly, and they usually take 24 or 25 pictures, or [[Frame rate|frames]] every second. When a [[movie projector]], a [[computer]], or a [[television]] shows the pictures at 24 frames a second, it looks like the things shown in the set of pictures are moving. [[Sound]] is usually recorded at the same time as the pictures are, but sometimes they are added later. The sounds in a movie are usually [[Dialogue|people talking]], the [[soundtrack]], and [[sound effect]]s. In the [[20th century]] the camera used [[photographic film]]. 
 
 ==Making movies == 
 Most movies start to be made when a [[screenwriter]] [[Screenwriting|writes]] a [[screenplay|script]], which is the [[Narrative|story]] of the movie with [[dialogue]] and [[word]]s and things that the [[actor]]s will say and do. A [[producer]] [[Recruitment|hires]] people to work on the movie and gets the money that will be used to pay for the [[actor]]s and the [[Tool|equipment]]. Producers usually get the money by [[Debt|borrowing]] it from a bank or by asking [[investor]]s to [[Loan|give money]] to them. Some producers work for a movie [[studio]], but other producers [[Self-employment|work by themselves]]. 
 
 [[Actor]]s and [[Movie director|directors]] read scripts to learn what to say and what to do. The actors learn the words from the script that they will say in the movie, and learn the things that the script tells them to do. Then, the director tells the actors what to do and a [[cameraman]] [[Cinematography|takes the film]] of them saying the words with a [[film camera]]. 
 
 When the filming is done, an [[Movie editing|editor]] makes the film play after each other, which makes a story. [[Audio engineer]]s and sound engineers record [[music]] and [[singing]] and [[wikt:combine|combine]] it with the film. When the movie is done, many [[Copying|copies]] of the movie are made by movie labs and put onto [[film reels]]. Then the reels are sent to [[movie theater]]s. A [[Movie projector|projector]] shines a very bright light through the film, and people sitting in a dark room see it on a big screen. 
 
 == Types of movies == 
 A [[genre]] means a type of movie. Movies can be [[fiction]]al, or [[non-fiction]]al. Even though hundreds of movies are made every year, there are not like another movie. Some movies can be two or more genres.

 ==Business of making movies== 
 Most movies lose money but some make up to hundreds of [[millions]]. In [[India]] movies have become an enormous part of the economy. The industry has always been led by a few [[major movie studios]] like [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], or Disney. 
 
 === Elements === 
 There are many large companies that provide all of the services needed to make movies, such as [[special effects]], lighting, [[Set construction|set building]]. Many of these employees belong to [[trade union]]s who say how much their members must be paid. A large number of smaller companies also offer services, such as music studios (which record the music for original movie sound tracks) and CGI [[computer animation]]. 
 
 === Distribution === 
 Finally there are movie distribution companies (Which send movies around the world or around a country), and advertising companies (Showing people who may watch the movie so they do it.) 
 
 Movies with famous [[movie star|stars]] (actors who are well known) and large [[budget]]s (lots of money), are designed to have a large appeal (something a person would like about the, so that hopefully [[millions]] of people will pay to see them. These most expensive [[movies]] are called [[blockbuster]]s. 
 
 [[Special effects]] can add a huge amount to the cost of a movie, especially the newest [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects, but people have come to expect them and every blockbuster movie tries to outdo the last. Even in 2008, some movies cost up to $200 million to make. 
 
 Very successful movies can make many times that amount in profit, and that's why the studios keep producing them. This kind of movie will have a lot of promotion (getting the movie into the public.) through [[television]] [[advertising]], [[billboard]]s and [[internet]] sites. 
 
 === Blockbuster === 
 In blockbuster movies, there is usually a happy ending, in which all of the problems in the plot (story) are figured out or fixed and almost everyone (except the bad guys) live happily ever after. Some movies have been so successful that the studios keep releasing more and more [[sequel]]s, or movies with the same characters and basic plots. 
 
 === Indie films === 
 At the opposite end of the scale to the blockbuster, there is the independent, art, or Indie movie. These are usually made by small movie companies, or even just a small group of people that do not have much money. An example is [[The Blair Witch Project]], which cost only about $60,000, but which has so far taken perhaps $200 million in ticket and DVD sales. Movies like this are very unusual and usually become popular 'underground' ([[word of mouth]] advertising), so that they have a [[cult]] following, or popular but not [[mainstream]]. 
 
 Independent movies often tell more creative or unusual (strange) stories, or may have sad endings that do not appeal to the big studios, because they can not be sure how the public will react to them. They rarely make a lot of money, but if they are successful, the big studios will quickly try to get the people involved to sign a [[contract]] with them, by offering them a lot of money to make another movie. Often the new movie, with its big budget and its stars will be less successful than the first. 
 
 == The Oscars == 
 Some movies received [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations, and wins. Also, some actors and actresses received Oscar nominations, and wins. 
 
 == Age appropriate ratings == 
 Movies have age appropriateness. Some examples include G, PG, PG 13, and R.
