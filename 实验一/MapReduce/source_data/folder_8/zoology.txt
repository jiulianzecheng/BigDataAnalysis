 '''Zoology''' is the [[science]]  of studying [[animal]] life. It is part of [[biology]]''. ''Animal life is classified into groups called [[phyla]], of which there are at least [[List of animal phyla|thirty]].  
 
 '''Zoologists''' are scientists who study animals. They may work in [[laboratory|laboratories]], or do [[field research]]. The methods are many and various. At the heart, they cover the [[structure]], [[Function (biology)|function]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] of animals. The structure is investigated by [[dissection]], and [[microscopic]] examination. The function is investigated by [[observation]] and [[experiment]]. [[Palaeontology]] supplies information about [[extinct]] animals. Zoologists may be employed by [[universities]], [[museum]]s, non-profit organisations, universities, or by [[zoo]]s.
