 A '''spinet''' is a small kind of [[harpsichord]]. In [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] times, and even later, people often had a spinet in their homes. The advantage of a spinet was that it was cheaper than a harpsichord and it also took up less room. 
 
 Sometimes the word used to be spelt differently, e.g.  " spinnet "  or  " spinnit " . 
 
 The spinet is different from a harpsichord because of the angle of the strings which run at an angle to the right. The whole instrument is a bit like a [[triangle]] in shape. The strings are arranged in pairs and the jacks (the [[feather|quills]] which pluck the strings) are also in pairs in the wider gaps, plucking the string next to them. 
 
 Harpsichords may have several sounds (in the same way that an [[pipe organ|organ]] has several [[Organ stop|stop]]s making different sounds). This is not possible on a spinet, which has one sound only. It is always an 8-foot sound (the notes sound at the normal [[pitch (music)|pitch]], never an octave higher). Spinets were useful for [[accompaniment (music)|accompanying]].
