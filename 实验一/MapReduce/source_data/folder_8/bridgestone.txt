 {{nihongo|'''Bridgestone Corporation'''|株式会社ブリヂストン|Kabushiki-gaisha Burijisuton}} ({{Tyo|5108}}) is a multinational [[rubber]] [[Company|conglomerate]]. It was founded in 1931 by {{nihongo|[[Shojiro Ishibashi]]|石橋正二郎|Ishibashi Shōjirō}} in the city of [[Kurume, Fukuoka]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], Japan. The name '''Bridgestone''' comes from a translation ''ishibashi'', meaning  " stone bridge "  in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 ===Origins=== 
 The very first Bridgestone [[tire]] was produced on April 9, 1930, by the Japanese  " [[Tabi]] "  Socks Tyre Division. On March 1, 1931, the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi, made the ''Tabi'' Socks tire Division independent and established the Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd. in the city of Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture.  " Bridgestone "  was named after the name of the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi (''Ishi'' = Stone, ''Bashi'' = Bridge). < ref name=asiatimes > {{cite news|first=Kosuke|last=Takahashi|title=Japan on the brink of a new era|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/KH29Dh01.html|work=Asia Times|date=2009-08-29|access-date=2009-08-31|archive-date=2009-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002040629/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/KH29Dh01.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The Bridgestone tire Co., Ltd. decided to build tires based solely on [[Japan]]ese [[technology]]. The company had many problems in the early days. Improvements were made in quality and the building processes. The business expanded rapidly on both the domestic and overseas markets. 
 
 === Challenges during and after World War II === 
 Wartime regulations sent nearly all of the company's output to the military. After the war, the company was devastated. The [[Tokyo]] Headquarters building was destroyed by aerial bombing. All of their overseas assets were lost. The [[factories]] in Kurume and [[Yokohama]] were not damaged. Production was restarted after the war ended. 
 
 After [[World War II]], Bridgestone started manufacturing [[motorcycle]]s. But its main income was from supplying tires to its rival motorcycle makers such as [[Honda]], [[Suzuki]] and [[Yamaha Motor Corporation|Yamaha]]. Bridgestone later decided to stop building motorcycles. 
 
 === Technological innovation === 
 In 1951, Bridgestone was the first company in Japan to begin selling rayon cord tires. The sale of nylon tires was started in 1959. 1967 saw the sale of first ever radial tire. Bridgestone's first overseas plant since the end of the war was opened in [[Singapore]] in 1965. '''Bridgestone America''' was started in the United States in 1967 to represent Bridgestone. The ''Super Filler Radial'' went on the market in 1978. In 1979 the company introduced the high-performance ''POTENZA'' radial tire. 
 
 The company name changed to Bridgestone Corporation in 1984. 
 
 == Firestone purchase == 
 In 1988, Bridgestone purchased the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]]. Bridgestone invested a lot of money into Firestone. They worked on rebuilding the Firestone company. By 1992, they were making a [[profit]] with ''Bridgestone Firestone Europe''. By 1993, they were making a profit with ''Bridgestone Firestone USA''. 
 
 The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and Bridgestone Tire Company Ltd USA were merged in 1990 and became '''Bridgestone Firestone North American Holdings Ltd'''. To increase the brand awareness, they re-entered the Firestone brand into [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] racing in 1995. In 1997, ''Bridgestone Corporation Japan'' entered the Bridgestone brand into [[Formula One]] racing. 
 
 == Bridgestone and Formula One racing == 
 Bridgestone has supplied tires in [[Formula One]] since {{F1|1997}}. They supplied tires on a one race only basis for the {{F1|1976}} and {{F1|1977}} [[Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grands Prix]]. These tires were for Japanese teams such as [[Heros Racing]] and [[Kojima Engineering|Kojima]].

 Bridgestone decided to supply tires for Formula One in 1995. They wanted to improve company's name value in the European market. Their main competitor was [[Michelin]]. 
 
 Their first title was acquired in {{F1|1998}} by [[Mika Häkkinen]] and [[McLaren]]-[[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes]]. Bridgestone users took five [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' championship]] titles and five [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' championship]] titles during the years that had more than one tire available. For ({{F1|1997}}–{{F1|1998}}), they competed with [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]. For ({{F1|2001}}–{{F1|2006}}), they competed with [[Michelin]]. 
 
 Michelin chose to end its Formula One tire program after the {{F1|2006}} season. All teams have used Bridgestone tires from the {{F1|2007}} season to the {{F1|2010}} season. On November 2, 2009 Bridgestone announced that they will end their contract to supply tires to Formula One teams after 2010. The company said it was  " addressing the impact of the continuing evolution of the business environment "   < ref > {{cite web |url=http://bridgestone.com/corporate/news/2009110201.html |title=Bridgestone to Cease Tire Supply to the FIA Formula One World Championship |access-date=2010-09-22 |date=2009-11-02 |work=bridgestone.com |publisher=Bridgestone Corp. |archive-date=2009-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104223536/http://bridgestone.com/corporate/news/2009110201.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
