An '''allowance''' is usually an [[amount]] of [[money]] that a [[parent]] gives to his/her [[child]]. 
 
 Possible reasons why allowance is given: 
 *The [[parent]] might have [[:wikt:simple:extra|extra]] [[money]] so he/she shares or gives it to the [[child]](ren). 
 *The [[parent]] might want to [[teach]] the [[child]] how to [[manage]] [[money]]. 
 *The [[parent]] might want the [[child]] to help him/her to do [[Chore|chores]] with or without allowance.
