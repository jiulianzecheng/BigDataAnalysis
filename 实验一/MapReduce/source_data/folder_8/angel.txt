 In many mythologies and [[religion]]s, an '''angel''' is a good [[spirit]]. The word angel comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''angelos'' which means  " messenger " . Angels appear frequently in the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], [[Qur'an]] and [[Aqdas]]. 
 
 Different references to angels throughout the Bible suggest different kinds and ranks of angels, such as seraphs (Hebrew [[plural]]: seraphim) or cherubs (Hebrew plural: cherubim). This resulted in medieval theologians outlining a hierarchy of such divine messengers, including not only cherubs and seraphs, but also archangels, powers, principalities, dominions and thrones. 
 
 The study of angels is called angelology.

 == Types of Angels == 
 * '''Cherubs''' are described as creatures which have four wings. < ref > {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:6}} < /ref >  Cherubim guard the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] with a [[sword]] of fire. < ref > {{bibleverse||Genesis|3:24}} < /ref >  This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God. < ref > The IVP New Bible Commentary pp734 states: ' the exact significance of the cherub is unclear' < /ref > 
 
 Ezekiel 28:13-14 
 13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 
 14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
 
 It describes the sound of their wings,  " like the roar of rushing waters. " < ref > {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:24}} < /ref > 
 
 Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings . 
 
 Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have  " straight feet "  and four wings and four faces. 
 
 Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16 
 
 Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be  " a wheel in the midst of a wheel "  and that the color of the wheels was the color of  " Amber "  Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there. 
 * '''Seraphs''' (Hebrew for  " burning " ) are depicted as having six wings They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the [[temple]]. < ref > {{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:4}} < /ref > 
 * '''Archangels''' like Gabriel ([[Gospel of Luke]] 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered [[saint]]s in the [[Catholic church]]. < ref name=ABF/ >  However, in the King James Version of the Bible; they are another type of angel. In the [[Book of Revelation]] the Angel Michael casts the 'great dragon' [[Satan]] out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels, just before the Great Judgement of angels and man. (Revelation 12) 
 * The [[Leviathan]] in [[Book of Job]] 41:19-21 has flame that goes: 'out of his mouth' like a [[dragon]]. Isaiah 30:6 also talks of a 'fiery flying serpent'. Compare Revelation 20:2: , where an angel: 'laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the [[Devil]], and Satan, and bound him a thousand years'. 
 
 == Religion == 
 
 === Rabbinic Judaism === 
 In [[Judaism]] angels are created by God from fire. They fullfil tasks given by God. Rabbinic Judaism rejects earlier accounts on fallen angels who sinned by mating with humans. Instead, angels are servants of God. Still, not all angels are benevolent. Some angels are jealous of humans, because God loves them so much. < ref name= " Reinhard Gregor Kratz 2006 " > {{cite book| last1 = Kratz| first1 = Reinhard Gregor| last2 = Spieckermann| first2 = Hermann| title = Gotterbilder, Gottesbilder, Weltbilder: Griechenland und Rom, Judentum, Christentum und Islam| year = 2006| publisher = Mohr Siebeck| isbn = 978-3-16-148807-8 }} < /ref >  Unlike angels, humans can overcome sin and repent. Angels cannot repent their sin, because they are already sinless. 
 
 When the Bible speaks about the creation of humans in the plural, Judaism sometimes argues that God discussed his decision with the angels. But they make clear, it is God alone who creates humans. God only wanted to discuss with the angels to show that someone in power, should still try to value the opinion of people lower. < ref name= " Reinhard Gregor Kratz 2006 " / > 
 
 === Islam === 
 In [[Islam]] angels are created by God ([[Allah]]) before [[Genie|jinn]] and humans. Angels live in heaven and fullfil God's orders. Some angels deliver messages to humans and prophets, most famous among them is [[Gabriel]]. Other angels support humans with rain. Some angels don't have a task on earth, but dwell in heaven, for example, to praise God. Muslims disagree if angels can fail a task, but they agree that an angel never want to disobey. Sometimes angels might simply make mistakes on accident, like the angels [[Harut and Marut]]. But these angels are not considered evil, they just lose their rank as punishment, but can restore their rank later again. Not all angels are nice. God gives angels violent tasks too. For example, God orders angels to punish people in [[hell]], not demons. Muslims believe hell is under God's control, and not the demon's. They believe hell is not only suffering, but also justice. Angels watch out that people don't escape their punishment. While the benevolent angels are said to be created from light, some Muslims think the angels in hell are created from fire. 
 
 ==In art== 
 They are often shown in art as having wings and a [[halo]]. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness. 
 
 The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small, non-useful wings. 
 
 The cherubim statue or [[bronze]] casting of cherubim in the Temple of [[Solomon]] depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making. 
 
 The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork, and was attempted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. 
 
 == In literature == 
 Angels are generally held to be holy and virtuous, hence the term is used loosely to apply to anyone particularly good or kind, or having a good influence. In his novel ''Far From the Madding Crowd'', [[Thomas Hardy]] chooses the name of an angel, Gabriel, for his kind and helpful hero. On the other hand, in his play ''Measure for Measure'', [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] use of the name Angelo is ironic, since Angelo is a character who likes to see himself as virtuous, but who is concealing evil aspects of his nature. Fallen angels, who are no longer holy or virtuous, are also known as devils. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Angels|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393361/obo-9780195393361-0079.xml|access-date=2021-09-02|website=obo|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 However, since angels are held to be spirits (that is, non-material beings), medieval [[Theology|theologians]] were faced with the problem of how humans could see a non-physical creature. Eventually a theory was put forward that angels must make themselves a body out of the nearest thing to the non-physical, i.e. from air. Hence in his famous poem ''Aire and Angels'', the seventeenth century metaphysical poet [[John Donne]] uses this idea to write a cynical comment on women, whose love, he says, is like an angel's body of air, while men's love is like the real thing, the angel itself. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Angels in literature, art and the Bible from Crossref-it.info|url=https://crossref-it.info/articles/1/angels|access-date=2021-09-02|website=crossref-it.info|archive-date=2021-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902153412/https://crossref-it.info/articles/1/angels|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Idea of Guardian angel == 
 From the era of the Romantics onwards, there has developed the widely held belief that everyone has an angel assigned to guard them. This concept is probably based on Jesus' comment in Matthew 18:10 regarding children, though it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. 
 
 ==In superstitions== 
 Seeing repetitive numbers are thought to be associated with [[numerology]], also referred to as [[Angel Numbers|angel numbers]]. It is believed that angels communicate with humans through repetitive appearances of numbers. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Angel Numbers: Meaning  &  Symbolism [Spiritual Guide]|url=https://takanta.com/angel-numbers|access-date=2021-05-14|website=Takanta|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|title=Angel Numbers: The Message and Meaning Behind 11:11 and Other Number Sequences|last=Gray|first=Kyle|page=67}} < /ref >  Humanity has studied and used numbers since the dawn of time, and no matter what the culture is, there are certain numbers that hold specific value or meaning over other numbers.
