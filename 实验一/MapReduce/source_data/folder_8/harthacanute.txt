 '''Harthacanute''' (Canute the Hardy, sometimes ''Hardicanute, Hardecanute''; [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Hardeknud'') (1018 – 8 June 1042) was King of [[Denmark]] from 1035 to 1042 and [[England]] from 1040 to 1042. He was the only son of [[Canute the Great]] and [[Emma of Normandy]]. 
 
 He followed his father as King of [[Denmark]] in 1035, becoming '''Canute III'''. Fighting with [[Magnus I of Norway]] stopped him from sailing to England to take up his throne. His older, [[illegitimate]] half-brother, [[Harold Harefoot]], became [[regent]] of England. 
 
 Harold took the English crown for himself in 1037. After Harthacanute had settled the situation in [[Scandinavia]] he prepared an [[invasion]] of England to take over his kingdom. Harold died, and Harthacanute was able to take back his throne peacefully. 
 
 Harthacanute was a [[wikt:harsh|harsh]] and unpopular ruler. To pay for his ships, he greatly increased the rate of [[taxation]]. In 1041, the people of [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] killed two of Harthacanute's men who had been collecting the tax. Harthacanute burned the city. The story of [[Lady Godiva]] riding naked through the streets of [[Coventry]] to persuade the local earl to lower taxes, may come from the reign of Harthacanute. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' says of him:  " He never accomplished anything kingly for as long as he ruled " . 
 
 In 1041, Harthacanute asked his half-brother [[Edward the Confessor]] (his mother Emma's son by [[Ethelred the Unready]]) back from [[exile]] in [[Normandy]] to become a member of his household, and probably made Edward his [[heir]]. Harthacanute was unmarried and had no children. On 8 June 1042, he died at [[Lambeth]]— he  " died as he stood at his drink, and he suddenly fell to the earth " . He was buried at [[Winchester Cathedral]], [[Hampshire]]. Edward became the new king.
