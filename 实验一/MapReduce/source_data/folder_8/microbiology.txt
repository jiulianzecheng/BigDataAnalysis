 '''Microbiology''' -  (Greek μικρός, mikrós, „tiny“, βίος, bíos, „life“ and λόγος, lógos, „science“) is a science in the composition of [[biology]], which is occupied by the study of [[microorganisms]] (bacterium, ([[Archaea|archaebacteria]]), microscopic [[fungi]], [[protozoa]],[[alga]],and [[viruses]]). Into the field of the interests of microbiology enter their systematics, morphology, physiology, biochemistry, evolution, role in the ecosystems  
 and also the possibility of practical use. [[Bacteriology]] and [[medical microbiology]] are a division of microbiology.

 == History == 
 
 In 1665, [[Robert Hooke]] saw that cork was made up of little cubes that he named [[cells]]. Later [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] made the important connection that cells are living things when he saw through his early [[microscope]] smallest one-celled organisms. Later [[Christian Ehrenberg]] found that[[Protist| protista]] or [[bacteria]] were different kinds of cells. In the late part of the 1800s [[Martinus Beijerinck]] showed that there were small particles called [[viruses]].  
 
 Another important change in the study of [[microorganism]]s came from the discovery of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].  This allowed using a [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] to change the inside of a cell without killing it.  One recent discovery that changed the study of microbiology is the discovery of [[transposon]]s or jumping genes.  Another one is the discovery of animal [[genes]] in the cells.

 == Branches == 
 
 The [[branches of microbiology]] can be classified into pure and applied sciences.  Microbiology can be also classified based on [[taxonomy]], as in the cases of [[bacteriology]], [[mycology]], protozoology, and [[phycology]].  There is considerable overlap between the specific branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines.  Certain aspects of these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope of microbiology
