[[File:Junghans Additionsstoppuhr, 1960er-Jahre (2 qu).JPG|thumb|As stopwatch; this model was common in the 1960s.]] 
 A '''stopwatch''' is a [[tool]] used to [[measurement|measure]] the amount of [[time]] something takes. For example, to learn how soon a [[car]] can reach 60 [[miles per hour]], or how much time it takes a [[running|runner]] to run 40 [[US yard|yards]]. These days, stopwatches are even installed in digital [[watch]]es. You press a [[button]] to start the time and press it again to stop the [[time]]. A stopwatch can tell you the time in seconds, hundredths of a second, or thousandths of a second.
