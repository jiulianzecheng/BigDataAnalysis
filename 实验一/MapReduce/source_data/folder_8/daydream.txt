 '''Daydreaming''' is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings. During a daydream, a person's contact with reality is blurred. External reality is second to a visionary [[fantasy]]. 
 
 There are many types of daydreams, and there is no agreed definition. However, the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming is a mild separation from the person's surroundings. < ref name= " Klinger " > Klinger, Eric October 1987. ''Psychology Today''. < /ref >  Daydreams are under conscious control, so they differ from [[dreams]], but they do have a kind of dream-like fantasy quality. Although daydreaming in children may be frowned upon by parents and teachers, it seems quite normal. There is evidence which suggests daydreaming is associated with mental health and stability. < ref > Reber A.S  &  E.S. 2001.
