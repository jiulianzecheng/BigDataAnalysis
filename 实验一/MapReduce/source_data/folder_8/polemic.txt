A '''polemic''' is a forceful [[argument]] or [[controversy]] made against one [[opinion]], [[doctrine]], or person.  
 
 It is one-sided and extreme, not a [[debate]] or [[discussion]]. It often occurs in [[dispute]]s.  
 
 The word is derived from the Greek ''polemikos'' (πολεμικός),  meaning  " warlike, hostile " . < ref > Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, Springfield, MA, 2005), s.v.

 ==History== 
 Polemic journalism was common in continental Europe, when [[defamation]] laws were less strict as they are now. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-467241/polemic |title=polemic, or polemical literature, or polemics (rhetoric)|publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2008-02-21}} < /ref >   
 
 To support study of the polemics and controversies of the 17th-19th centuries, a British research project has placed thousands of pamphlets of that era online. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://specialcollections.st-and.ac.uk/projpamph.htm | title=Pamphlet and polemic: Pamphlets as a guide to the controversies of the 17th-19th centuries | publisher=St Andrews University Library | accessdate=2008-02-21 | archive-date=2008-12-07 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207063940/http://specialcollections.st-and.ac.uk/projpamph.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref >
