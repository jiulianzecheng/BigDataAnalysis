 A '''telephone''', also known as a '''phone''', is a [[communication]] [[tool]]. People use it to talk with people far away. Originally, it was an [[electric]] tool sending [[analogue]] [[speech]] through wires. Many telephones in the 21st century are [[electronic]] tools sending [[digital signal]]s on wires or [[radio]] transmission. Using a telephone, two people who are in different places can talk to each other. Early telephones needed to be connected with [[wire]]s which are called fixed or landline telephones. Modern [[mobile phone]]s use [[radio wave]]s. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was the first person to [[patent]] the telephone, in 1876. < ref name= " WDL " > {{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11375/ |title = Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory Notebook, 1875-1876 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1875â€“1876 |accessdate = 2013-07-24 }} < /ref >  Early telephones were wired directly to each other and could only talk to the phone that they were connected to. Later, telephone exchanges allowed connecting to other telephones. During the 20th century the machines that made the connections were [[Automation|automated]]. 
 
 == Types of telephones == 
 
 There are many different types of telephones. A telephone that can be carried around is called a [[mobile phone]] or cell phone. These became popular in the  [[1980s]]. It has become common for people to carry mobile phones and in some places it is unusual to not have one. The majority are [[smartphone]]s, which can be used as [[computer]]s. Some mobile phones are able to make telephone calls using [[communications satellite]]s instead of masts on the ground, which means people can make calls from anywhere in the world. 
 
 In most countries there are public [[payphone]]s.  To use one, people pay with [[coins]], a [[credit card]] or a [[prepaid card]]. 
 
 [[Computer]]s can use a machine called a [[modem]] or a [[Digital subscriber line]] router to talk to other computers over a telephone line. This allows a computer to connect to other [[computer network]]s including the [[Internet]].   
 
 Most countries have a telephone [[network]]. The telephones in one place are connected to a telephone exchange. The exchanges are connected together in a world-wide network. In [[developing countries]] cell phones are used as a cheaper and faster way to connect the countryside to the network. 
 
 == Telephone number == 
 Most telephones have their own number. Today, telephone numbers are about seven to ten digits long. In many countries, part of the telephone number is called the ''area code''. Area codes are used to make sure the numbers are not the same in two different places. Areas have their own area code, and countries have their own [[List of country calling codes|country code]]. 
 
 == Usage == 
 By the end of 2009, there were a total of nearly 6 billion mobile and fixed-line telephone subscribers worldwide. This included 1.26 billion fixed-line subscribers and 4.6 billion mobile subscribers. < ref > [http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2007/20.html Next-Generation Networks Set to Transform Communications], International Telecommunications Union website, 4 September 2007.
