'''Homophony''' means [[music]] in which the voices or instruments sing or play [[chord]]s (chords are when two or more notes are played together.)  In '''homophonic''' music all the choir ([[soprano]]s, [[alto]]s, [[tenor]]s and [[bass (singer)|basses]]) are singing the same words at the same time.  There is a tune on top and the lower parts are the [[accompaniment (music)|accompaniment]].  This is what happens in [[hymn]] singing. The opposite is '''polyphony'''.  '''Polyphonic''' writing is more complicated: the choir sing different melodic lines at the same time (see [[counterpoint]]).  The terms  " homophony "  (literally:  " one sound " )  and  " polyphony "  (literally:  " many sounds " ) are mostly used for choir music. 
 
 In homophonic music it is easy to hear the words that are being sung.  In polyphonic music it is much harder for the listener to understand the words.  Composers often used polyphony when writing music for the [[mass (musical setting)|mass]] because everyone knew the words anyway.  Homophonic music became more important when [[composer]]s started to write [[opera]]s and [[madrigal]]s where a story is being told and the words must be heard clearly.
