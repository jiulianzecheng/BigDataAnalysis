 A '''sphygmomanometer''' (({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|f|ɪ|ɡ|m|oʊ|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|m|ᵻ|t|ər}}, {{respell|SFIG|moh-mə|NOM|i-tər}}; also called a '''blood pressure meter''', '''blood pressure monitor''', or '''blood pressure gauge''') is a device used to measure [[blood pressure]] in [[human]]s. It was first invented by an [[Austria]]n [[physician]] in 1881. They now come in different shapes and sizes. They can be found in many places. 
 
 The sphygmomanometer works by wrapping a [[cylinder|tube]] of [[fabric]] (called a  " cuff " ) around the arm or other body part. The cuff is filled up with [[air]]. That stops the flow of [[blood]] in the [[arm]]. The air is then released slowly until the blood flows again. The whole process, from start to finish, only takes about a minute. 
 
 Many sphygmomanometers are inflated by squeezing a [[bulb]]. A [[gauge]] shows how much the cuff is inflated. The gauge can be [[gear|mechanical]] or [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] (filled with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]).  It is important that the cuff is not inflated too much, so whoever is using the device has to use a [[stethoscope]].  
 
 Some sphygmomanometers, especially those that people use at home, are automatic. They inflate using an [[Electricity|electric]] [[pump]]. They show the blood pressure on a screen. They are meant to be very easy to use.
