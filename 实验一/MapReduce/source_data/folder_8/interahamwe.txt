The '''Interahamwe''' ([[Pronunciation|pronounced]] Een-tair-ah-hahm-way, with the 't' pronounced as an 'h') was the main mob [[army]] that started the [[Rwandan Genocide]] in 1994. In this [[mass murder]], about one million [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] people were killed. 
 
 == Methods == 
 The Interahamwe usually used [[machete]]s ('mupanga') to do the killing, but [[Gun|guns]], [[Hand grenade|grenades]] and primitive tools like nail-studded [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]] were also used. 
 
 == Beginning == 
 About a half an hour after the President of [[Rwanda]], [[Juv√©nal Habyarimana]], was killed on the night of April 6, 1994, Interahamwe roadblocks were put up all over the city of [[Kigali]], the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Rwanda]]. The violence that followed would last about 100 days. This resulted in at least 500,000 deaths, but some say even up to 800,000-1,000,000 deaths.
