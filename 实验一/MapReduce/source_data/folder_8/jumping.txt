 '''Jumping''' is a form of  movement in which an [[organism]] pushes itself up through the air and falls back down. Jumping is different from [[running]], galloping and other ways of moving because the body is airborne for a longer period of time. 
 
 Some [[animal]]s, such as the [[kangaroo]], use jumping as their main form of traveling, while others, such as [[frog]]s, only use it to escape [[predator]]s. Jumping is also an important feature of many different activities and sports, including the [[long jump]], [[high jump]], and show jumping. 
 
 ==Classification== 
 One way to classify jumping is by looking at how the feet launch and land. < ref > ''Study Guide for Elementary Labanotation'' by Peggy Hackney, Sarah Manno (Editor), Muriel Topaz (Editor) < /ref >  In this classification system, there are five basic types of jumping: 
 * '''Jump''' - jumping from and landing on two feet 
 * '''Hop''' - jumping from one foot and landing on the same foot  
 * '''Leap''' - jumping from one foot and landing on the other foot 
 * '''Assemble''' - jumping from one foot and landing on two feet 
 * '''Sissonne''' - jumping from two feet and landing on one foot
