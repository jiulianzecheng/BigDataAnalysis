 == History == 
 Agra has a rich history, seen in the monuments around the city. Though the heritage of Agra city is linked with the Mughal dynasty, many other rulers also contributed to the rich past of this city. Modern Agra was founded by [[Sikandar Lodhi]] in the 16th century. Babar (founder of the Mughal dynasty) also stayed for sometime in Agra and introduced the concept of [[square (geometry)|square]] [[Iran|Persian-styled]] [[garden]]s here. [[Emperor]] [[Akbar]] built the Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri near Agra. Fatehpur Sikri remained its [[Capital (City)|capital]] for around fifteen years after which the city was left isolated in mysterious [[circumstance]]s. Jahangir beautified Agra with palaces and gardens despite spending most of his time in [[Kashmir]]. 
 
 Agra‘s greatest time came when [[Shahjahan]] ascended to the throne of [[Mughal Empire]]. He marked the greatest point of [[Mughal]] [[architecture]]. He built the [[Taj Mahal]] in memory of his favourite wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. In his later years, [[Shahjahan]] shifted his capital to the new city of [[Shahjahanabad]]([[Delhi]]) and ruled from there. [[Shahjahan]] was removed in [[1658]] by his son, [[Aurangzeb]] who kept him as prisoner in the Agra Fort. Aurangzeb shifted the capital back to Agra before his [[death]]. After the death of Aurangzeb, Mughal Empire could not reach its [[peak]] and many regional [[kingdom]]s emerged. The [[post]]-Mughal [[era]] of Agra saw the rule of the Jats, Marathas and finally the [[British]] taking over the city. After British Raj ended, Agra became part of independent India.
