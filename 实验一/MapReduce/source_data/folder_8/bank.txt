 A '''bank''' is a [[company|financial institution]] where customers can save or [[wikt:borrow|borrow]] [[money]]. Banks also [[invest]] money to build up their reserve of money. What they do is regulated by [[laws]]. Those laws differ in different countries. The people who work at a bank are called bank employees. Certain banks deal directly with the public and they are the only ones which an ordinary person will deal with. Other banks deal with [[investment]]s and international [[currency]] [[trading]]. 
 
 Customer's money may be placed in the bank for safe keeping. Banks may give loans to customers under an agreement to pay the money back to the bank at a later time, with [[interest]]. An example is getting a [[mortgage]] to buy a house or apartment. Banks also can use the money they have from [[deposit account]]s to [[invest]] in businesses in order to make more money. 
 
 In most countries the rules for banks are made by the government acting through laws. A [[central bank]] (such as the [[Bank of England]]) adjusts how much money is issued at a particular time. This is a factor in the [[economy]] of a country, and the [[government]] takes the big decisions. These  " banks of issue "  take in, and issue out, [[coins]] and [[banknote]]s. 
 
 == History == 
 The word ''bank'' comes from an Italian word ''banco'', meaning ''a bench'', since Italian [[merchant]]s in the [[Renaissance]] made deals to borrow and lend money  beside a bench. They placed the money on that bench.

 In the 17th century, merchants started storing their gold with goldsmiths in London. The [[goldsmith]]s had their own vaults, and charged a fee for storing the merchants' gold. The goldsmiths eventually started loaning money using the gold left to them, and also paid [[interest]] on the gold. 
 
 The [[Bank of England]] began issuing [[banknote]]s in 1695.  The oldest bank still in existence is [[Monte dei Paschi di Siena]] in [[Siena]], [[Italy]], which started in 1472.
