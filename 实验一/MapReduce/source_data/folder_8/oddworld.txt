Each Abe game has a feature called GameSpeak where Abe can speak to his fellow Mudokons and take control of the Slig. This is done by chanting. Once the Slig is possessed, he can do what he could do whilst he was not possessed  but he can shoot other Sligs and Slogs and unlock doors and electric walls The goal of the game is to save Abe's friends who are known as  " Mudokons " . There are 99 Mudokons in the game. Some of them are hidden in secret areas and when Abe lands in a secret area, the game will give the player an audio cue. The game has two different ways it ends. If, at the end of the game, the player does not save at least 50 native Mudokons, the bad ending will appear instead of the good ending.

 Travis Northup of ''[[IGN]]'' considered it  " an excellent remake of a delightfully weird '90s platformer with tons of charm, challenge... and annoying bugs " . 
 
 [[Chris Carter]], writing for ''[[Destructoid]]'', praised the levels for their openness and amount of content, as well as the variety in gameplay; he particularly commended the improvements to the series' mechanics, calling the movement system  " one of the best parts of ''Soulstorm'' " . However, he criticized aspects of menu navigation, writing it was  " testy at times and requires a firm few (button) mashes to get going " , as well as checkpoint placement and technical issues.
