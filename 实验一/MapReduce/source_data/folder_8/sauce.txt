 In [[cooking]], a '''sauce''' is a [[liquid]] mixture added to another [[food]] for [[flavour]]. Sauces are not normally eaten by themselves; they add [[flavour]], [[moisture]], and visual appeal to another dish. Sauces are an essential element in cuisines all over the world. 
 
 The main sauces of [[French cuisine]] are built on a basis of [[roux]], which is just flour and the liquid part of butter. Examples from Italian cuisine are the egg, cheese and [[ham]] sauce called ''[[Carbonara]]''; the ground [[meat]] sauce called [[Bolognese sauce|''bolognese'']], and the [[herb]]s and [[garlic]] sauce called ''[[pesto]]''. 
 
 Bottled sauces can be poured over food when it is served. An example would be the [[tomato]]-based sauce that is usually poured over [[spaghetti]]. Gravy is a brown sauce served with meat. 
 
 ''Sauce'' is a [[French language|French]] word taken from the [[Latin]] ''salsus'', meaning ''salted''. Possibly the oldest sauce recorded is ''[[garum]]'', the [[fish sauce]] used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. 
 
 Sauces need a liquid component, but some sauces (for example, [[pico de gallo|pico de gallo salsa]] or [[chutney]]) may contain more solid elements than liquid. 
 
 Sauces may be used for savoury dishes or for desserts. They can be prepared and served cold, like [[mayonnaise]], prepared cold but served lukewarm like [[pesto]], or can be cooked like [[bechamel]] and served warm or again cooked and served cold like [[apple sauce]]. 
 
 Some sauces are commercial products like [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[HP sauce]], [[soy sauce]] or [[ketchup]]. In French cuisine they are freshly prepared by the chef. Sauces for salads are called [[salad dressing]]. A cook who specializes in making sauces is a [[saucier]].

 Sauces in [[French cuisine]] date back to the Middle Ages. There were hundreds of sauces in the culinary repertoire, and were a major defining characteristic of French cooking of the 19th and 20th centuries, until [[nouvelle cuisine]]. 
 
 In the 19th century, the chef [[Antonin Carême]] classified sauces into four families, each of which was based on a '''mother sauce''' (Also called ''grandes sauces''). Carême's four mother sauces were: 
 * [[Béchamel sauce|Béchamel]], based on milk, thickened with a white [[roux]]. 
 * [[Espagnole]], based on brown [[stock (food)|stock]] (usually veal), thickened with a brown roux. 
 * [[Velouté sauce|Velouté]], based on a white stock, thickened with a blonde roux. 
 * [[Allemande sauce|Allemande]], based on velouté sauce, is thickened with egg yolks and heavy cream. 
 
 In the early 20th century, the chef [[Auguste Escoffier]] updated this classification to five mother sauces. They are: 
 * Sauce [[Béchamel]], Milk based sauce, thickened with a white roux. 
 * Sauce [[Velouté sauce|Velouté]], White stock based sauce, thickened with a [[roux]] or a liaison. 
 * Sauce [[Tomate sauce|Tomate]], Tomato based sauce, thickened with a roux. 
 * Sauce [[Espagnole]], Roasted veal stock based sauce, thickened with a brown roux. 
 * Sauce [[Hollandaise sauce|Hollandaise]], an [[emulsion]] of [[egg yolk]], [[butter]] and [[lemon]] juice or [[vinegar]]. [[Béarnaise sauce]] (sauce béarnaise) is a  " child "  of hollandaise, meaning it is a variation on the theme. 
 
 A sauce which is based on one of the mother sauces is sometimes called a '''small sauce''', '''minor sauce''', or '''secondary sauce'''. < ref > http://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--34435/small-sauce.asp Small sauce, definition < /ref >  Most sauces commonly used in classical cuisine are small sauces, or derivatives of one of the above-mentioned mother sauces. 
 
 Mother sauces are not commonly served as they are; instead they are augmented with additional ingredients to make small (derivative) sauces. For example, Bechamel can be made into [[Mornay sauce|Mornay]] by the addition of [[Gruyère (cheese)|Gruyère]] or any cheese one may like, and Espagnole becomes Bordelaise with the addition and reduction of red wine, shallots, and poached beef marrow.
