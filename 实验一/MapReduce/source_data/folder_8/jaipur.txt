 The city of Jaipur was founded by [[Amer, India|King of Amer]], [[Jai Singh II|Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II]] on 18 November 1727, who ruled from 1699 to 1743. He wanted to move his capital from Amer, {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} to Jaipur because the population was growing and there was not enough water. The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to finish. < ref name= " Hist " > {{cite web|title=About Jaipur|url=http://jaipur.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/jaipur/en/about-jaipur/history.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103091000/http://jaipur.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/jaipur/en/about-jaipur/history.html|archive-date=3 November 2015|access-date=5 November 2015|publisher=Government of Rajasthan}} < /ref >
