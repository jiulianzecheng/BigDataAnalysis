 '''Redhead''' is a person with [[red]] or reddish-tinted hair. Approximately 1 to 2% of the world's population has red hair. 
 
 In Iceland people that have red hair are called Anton Einar or short name for it lúði and came from the Greek gods, Zues and Hades. 
 
 Red hair is made by [[genes]]. The gene for red hair is [[recessive]], meaning to be weaker than other genes, like the brown hair gene, for example. Because of this, in order to have natural red hair a person needs to have red-haired [[ancestor]]s present on both the maternal (mother's) and paternal (father's) side of the family. 
 
 Red hair is said to be most common close to the Northern European coasts and islands of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], like [[British Isles]], and in particular among [[Celts|Celtic people.]] 
 
 In [[Ireland]], the percentage of population with red hair is very high relative to the rest of the world at around 10%, < ref > {{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330260131|title = Stature, head form, and pigmentation of adult male Irish|year = 1940|last1 = Hooton|first1 = Earnest A.|journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume = 26|issue = 1|pages = 229–249}} < /ref >  with 46% carrying the gene. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_93980|title=Genetic test for ginger hair? - BioNews|website=www.bionews.org.uk|date=February 2013 }} < /ref >  Parts of the United Kingdom such as Scotland also have very high percentages with around 6%. < ref name= " telegraph.co.uk " > {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/10264427/Edinburgh-is-surprise-capital-of-redheaded-Britain-and-Ireland.html|title=Edinburgh is surprise capital of redheaded Britain and Ireland|first=Auslan|last=Cramb|date=24 August 2013|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}} < /ref > < ref name= " dailymail.co.uk " > {{cite web|url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2401346/Ginger-genes-Research-reveals-20MILLION-red-hair-gene-carriers-Britain-Ireland.html|title=Secret army of red heads: Research reveals there are 20MILLION red hair gene carriers in the UK|date=24 August 2013|website=Mail Online}} < /ref >  There was a misconception that red hair occurrence in Scotland ran at around 13%, due to this figure appearing in reliable media sources, < ref > {{cite news|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-20237511|title = DNA project aims to count Scots redheads|work = BBC News| date=7 November 2012 }} < /ref >  however this figure was only an estimate and has since been disproved by research.

 Depite all this, the [[US]] has the largest number of redheads living there in the world (up to 18 million compared to 650,000 redheads living in Scotland). 
 
 In some countries, particularly the [[British Isles]], despite the high proportion of redheads there, redheads are sometimes given rude names such as  " carrot-top "  and  " ginga " , and are in some cases heavily ridiculed (made fun of) by their peers. In some extreme cases, people have been harassed (others have behaved threateningly towards them) for having red hair.
