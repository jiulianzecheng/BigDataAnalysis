When something is '''artificial''', or '''man-made''', it has been made by [[human]]s, not [[nature]]. For example, an [[satellite (artificial)|artificial satellite]] is one made by humans, while a [[Satellite (natural)|natural satellite]] is a satellite that was not made by humans. Many artificial things [[wikt:imitate|imitate]] or [[wikt:copy#Verb|copy]] things found in nature. The imitation may use the same basic [[material]]s as those in the natural object; or it may use quite different materials, as in [[Artificial leather]]. These are concepts in defining [[reality]]. < ref name= " Simon " > {{cite book|author=Herbert A.

 The word  " artificial "  comes from the [[Latin]] words ''art'' (meaning  " skill " ) and ''fex'' ( " to make " ). < ref > {{citation|title=An Exploration of Artificiality|author=Klaus Krippendorff|publisher=University of Pennsylvania, Annenberg School for Communication|work=Departmental Papers|year=2007|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1246 & context=asc_papers|format=PDF}} < /ref > 
 
 Artificial does not necessarily mean ''[[wikt:synthetic|synthetic]]'' (that is, created by [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]]). An [[artificial sweetener]] imitates [[Sweet (taste)|sweetness]] using a chemical formula that is not found in nature; it is therefore both artificial and synthetic. 
 
 Some [[Disaster|disasters]] are natural, but some are [[man-made disaster]]s. like the dust-bowl disaster in the [[United States]]. See [[Dust Bowl]].
