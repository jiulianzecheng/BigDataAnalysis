 '''Maniraptors''' ( " hand snatchers " ) is a [[clade]] of [[coelurosauria]]n dinosaurs starting in the [[Jurassic]] period. 
 
 Many [[paleontologist]]s believe [[bird]]s [[evolution|evolved]] from them some 150 or so million years ago. Hence, according to [[phylogenetic]] [[taxonomy]], birds are by definition maniraptors, and the other maniraptors are their closest relatives. It is now known, from the [[Jehol biota]], that many or all of this clade had [[feather]]s. They are often called [[dinobird]]s. 
 
 The most primitive ([[basal]]) member of the group may be ''[[Ornitholestes]]'', and the most advanced ([[Derived (biology)|derived]]) of the non-bird maniraptors is ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and ''[[Deinonychus]]''.
