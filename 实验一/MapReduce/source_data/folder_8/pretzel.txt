 A '''pretzel''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Bretzel'', [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''bradchdal'', [[German language|German]]: ''Breze'' or ''Brezel'') is a baked [[snack]] that originated in [[Germany]]. It is traditionally twisted into a unique [[knot]]-like shape. The pretzel [[dough]] is made from [[wheat]] flour and [[yeast]]. Before baking, it is dipped into  " Natronlauge "  ({{lang-en|sodium [[lye]]}}, [[sodium hydroxide]] [[solution]] (NaOH) or [[sodium carbonate]] solution (Na < sub > 2 < /sub > CO < sub > 3 < /sub > )) and sprinkled with coarse salt. During baking, a [[Maillard reaction]] then gives the pretzel its characteristic brown color and distinctive flavor. In [[Bavaria]], it is obligatory in a [[Wei√üwurst]] breakfast. 
 
 Because they are made mostly of wheat, pretzels can be problematic for people who have wheat allergy, [[coeliac disease]], or wheat intolerances. 
 
 There are different types of pretzels, like [[chocolate]] pretzels. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.pretzelcrisps.com/flavor/milk-chocolate-crunch/ | title=Milk Chocolate Crunch Pretzel Crisps }} < /ref >
