 '''Thalwil''' is a [[Municipalities|municipality]] in the district of [[Horgen (district)|Horgen]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Zurich (canton)|Z端rich]] in [[Switzerland]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Early [[medieval|Middle Ages]] Thalwil was [[Alamanni|Alemannic]] [[farm]]land. 
 
 Thalwil was originally four ''Wachten'', or [[hamlet]]s: 
 * Ludretikon, the oldest hamlet (mentioned in 915), bordering [[R端schlikon]] 
 * Oberdorf (Upper Village), the area around the [[church]] 
 * Unterdorf (Lower Village), the area roughly south of the [[railway station]] 
 * Langnau am Albis, (which separated from Thalwil around 1713) 
 
 In the Middle Ages, most [[income]] was made in farming, [[wine|vineyards]] and a small amount of [[fishing]] on the [[lake]].  
 Thalwil also has the oldest [[wood]] [[company|corporation]] in the [[Canton of Zurich]], the ''Bannegg-Waldung''. It was first mentioned in 1483. 
 
 ==Modern day Thalwil== 
 Today, the [[economy]] of Thalwil is mostly some small and medium-sized [[company|businesses]], and a wide range of [[shop]]s. Most of the shops are located around Gotthardstrasse- the town centre. 
 
 The main source of Thalwil's wealth lies with its 7,000 [[commuting residents|commuters]]. These people live in Thalwil, but work in [[Z端rich City|Zurich city]]. Today, Thalwil has left most of its farming past behind in exchange for a town of commuters, with its public [[transportation]] links, low [[tax]] and good quality of life.
