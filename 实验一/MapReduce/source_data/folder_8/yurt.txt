 A '''yurt''', also known as a '''ger''' in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], is a portable, round tent. It is covered with skins or felt. A yurt is commonly used as a dwelling by nomads in the [[Grassland|grasslands]] of [[Central Asia]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of YURT|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yurt|access-date=2022-03-18|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref >

 Traditional yurts consist of an expanding wooden circular frame carrying a felt cover. The [[felt]] is made from the wool of sheep. The [[wood]] to make the external structure is not to be found on the treeless [[steppes]]. 
 
 A yurt is designed to be dismantled and the parts carried compactly on [[camel]]s or [[yak]]s to be rebuilt on another site. Complete construction takes around 2 hours.
