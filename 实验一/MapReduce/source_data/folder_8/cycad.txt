 '''Cycads''' are [[seed plant]]s whose [[fossil]]s are first found in the early [[Permian]] period. < ref > Willis K.J  &  McElwain J.C. 2002. ''The evolution of plants''. Chapter 5 Major emergence of the seed plants, and specifically p133/4. < /ref > 
 
 They were very common in the [[Mesozoic]] [[era]], the age of the [[dinosaur]]s, and are still living, but are now much less common. Only nine [[genus|genera]] (about 100 species) of cycads are [[extant]] nowadays. In the Lower Jurassic they were part of the forests which became the Jurassic [[coal measure]]s in part of the world. The fronds could be reached and eaten by some of the typical herbivores of the day. 
 
 Cycads are thought to have evolved from order [[Pteridospermatophyta|Pteridospermae]] (seed ferns) of angiosperms, now totally [[extinct]]. 
 
 They are different from most plants because they have large crowns of compound [[Leaf|leaves]] and a stout [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]. They are [[evergreen]], [[dioecious]] plants having large pinnately compound leaves. < ref > Pinnate: feather-like or multi-divided features arising from both sides of a common axis. < /ref >   
 
 They are frequently confused with and mistaken for [[Arecaceae|palms]] or [[fern]]s, but are only distantly related to both, and instead belong to the [[division (biology)|division]] '''Cycadophyta'''. 
 
 Cycads are [[gymnosperms]] (naked seeded). Their [[fertilization|unfertilized]] seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by [[pollination]]. This contrasts with [[angiosperms]], which have enclosed seeds and more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized [[pollinator]]s, usually a specific species of [[beetle]].  
 
 They have been reported to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in association with various [[cyanobacteria]] living in the roots (the  " coralloid "  roots). < ref > {{citation |authors=Rai, A.N.; Soderback, E.; Bergman, B. |year=2000 |title=Tansley Review No. 116. Cyanobacterium-Plant Symbioses |journal=The New Phytologist |volume=147 |issue=3 |pages=449–481 |jstor=2588831 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00720.x|pmid=33862930 }} < /ref >   
 
 These photosynthetic cyanobacteria produce a [[neurotoxin]] called [[BMAA]] that is found in the [[seed]]s of cycads. This is a typical [[defence against herbivory]]. the neurotoxin may enter a food chain if the cycad seeds are eaten, and may cause some [[neurology|neurological]] diseases. < ref name=Holtcamp > {{cite journal | author = Holtcamp, W. | year = 2012 | title = The emerging science of BMAA: do cyanobacteria contribute to neurodegenerative disease? | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 120 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.120-a110 | pmid=22382274 | pmc=3295368 | pages=a110–a116}} < /ref > < ref name= " Cox and Davis " > {{cite journal | authors = Cox, PA, Davis, DA, Mash, DC, Metcalf, JS, Banack, SA. | year = 2015 | title = Dietary exposure to an environmental toxin triggers neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits in the brain | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 283 | issue = 1823 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2015.2397 | pages=20152397 | pmid=26791617 | pmc=4795023}} < /ref >
