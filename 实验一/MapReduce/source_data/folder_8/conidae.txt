 '''Conidae''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of minute to quite large [[sea snail]]s. They are [[Marine biology|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s in the superfamily [[Conoidea]]. Their beautiful shells are highly collectible. < ref > Sullivan B.N. 2009. Collecting cone shells: special handling required. ''The Right Blue''. [http://therightblue.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/collecting-cone-shells-special-handling.html] < /ref > 
 
 The snails within this family are sophisticated [[predatory]] animals. < ref > Piper R. 2007. ''Extraordinary animals: an encyclopedia of curious and unusual animals'', Greenwood Press. < /ref >  The snails have eyes, and are active hunters. < ref > Sullivan B.N. 2009. ''Muck-diving''. The Right Blue. [http://therightblue.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/muck-diving-tale-of-cross-eyed-cone.html] < /ref >  They immobilize prey with a modified [[radula]]r tooth. The tooth delivers [[Poison|venom]] with [[neurotoxin]]s; it is launched out of the snail's mouth in a [[harpoon]]-like action. 
 
 There have been many suggested changes to the classification of cone shells, and the details are still under investigation. The very large genus ''[[Conus]]'' has 600 species, and there are six other subfamilies.
