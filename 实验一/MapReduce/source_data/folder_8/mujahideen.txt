 '''''Mujahideen''''' ({{lang-ar|مجاهدين}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mujāhidīn}}'') is the plural of '''''mujahid''''' ({{lang-ar|مجاهد|links=no}}). Mujahid is the Arabic term for one engaged in ''[[jihad]]'' (literally,  " struggle " ). This term was first used to describe [[guerrilla]]-type militant groups led by the [[Islamist]] Afghan fighters in the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. As of 2021, it is also used to described other jihadist groups in other countries.  
 
 The English term ''[[jihadists]]'' is also related to the mujahideen. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llhGT3RxzpoC & q=%22mujahideen%22+%22jihadists%22|title=Evaluating the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, S. 2930: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, Second Session, July 14, 2010|last=Drugs|first=United States Congress Senate Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and|date=2011|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160883064|location=|pages=297|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fg6AQAAMAAJ & dq=%22mujahideen%22+%22jihadists%22 & pg=RA2-PA45|title=Infantry|last=|first=|date=2007|publisher=U.S. Army Infantry School|isbn=|location=|pages=45|language=en}} < /ref >
