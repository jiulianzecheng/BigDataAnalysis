 A '''prescription''' (â„ž) is a message given by a [[Medical doctor|doctor]] to a [[wikt:patient|patient]] saying what to do. It may say to get special [[medicine]] that is only for people with a prescription. Those drugs are often very strong, and they cannot be bought normally from a [[pharmacy]] as you could with [[over-the-counter drug]]s. Some prescription drugs, for example [[Oxycontin]] or [[Hydrocodone]], are used [[Illegal drugs|illegally]] to become intoxicated. Using prescription drugs illegally may result in [[drug addiction]], illness, and death.  A prescription can also be a way to tell another person how to help the patient, such as for [[physical therapy]]. 
 
 Prescriptions were written on paper.  Now most of them are sent [[electronic]]ally.  This is quicker. It also means there are not so many mistakes. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Wickware|first=Carolyn|title=Electronic prescribing system cuts dispensing errors by almost half in one trust|url=https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/news/electronic-prescribing-system-cuts-dispensing-errors-by-almost-half-in-one-trust|access-date=2023-02-05|website=The Pharmaceutical Journal|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 '''Know your prescription'''  It is important for a patient to learn about the medication that the doctor has prescribed for them. This can be done by asking the pharmacist, reading the patient information leaflet or by searching for the medication on the Internet.
