 ==History== 
 [[File:Cretan Paximadia AB.jpg|thumb|200px|A bag of paximathia from Crete.]] 
 The name ''paximathia'' comes from the Greek word ''paximadion'' (παξιμάδιον), which comes from a 1st-century Greek named [[Paxamus]] who wrote a [[cookbook]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Dalby|1996|pp=164–165:  " Paxamus was a man of wide interests, according to a Byzantine lexicon: 'Paxamus, author. ''Cookery'' in alphabetical order. ''Boeotica'' in 2 books. ''The Twelvefold Art'': this is about sexual postures. ''Dyeing'', 2 [books]. ''Farming'' 2 [books]' (''Suda'', s.v.)...Paxamus is in a sense still remembered: a barley biscuit, first recorded in the second century and well known in Byzantine and modern Greece, is supposed to have taken its name ''paxamâs'', ''paximádion'' from him. " }} < /ref >  The word first appears in a recipe for [[laxative]] biscuits written by the Greek doctor [[Galen]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Dalby|1996|loc=Endnote #48, p. 257:  " The word first occurs in Galen, ''Handy Remedies'' 3 [14.537], a recipe for laxative biscuits... " }} < /ref > 
 
 Paximathia were eaten by Greek farmers, < ref name=Kochilas1993/ >  the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]], and [[priest]]s. < ref > {{harvnb|Dalby|1996|p=196:  " The basic food of the Byzantine army was cereal, in several convenient forms. Of great importance was the barley biscuit that was possibly named after the late Hellenistic cook Paxamus (Chapter 7, p. 165). It was probably the food that the future Emperor Justin II, uncle of Justinian, carried in his knapsack, the food that kept him alive on his long walk from Illyria to Constantinople; it was certainly food for soldiers and for frugal priests as well. " }} < /ref >  Greek farmers would eat paximathia in their fields after softening them by soaking them in [[water]] and [[olive oil]]. < ref name=Kochilas1999/ > < ref name=Kochilas1993/ >  They sometimes ate them with other foods like homemade [[cheese]] and a few [[Olive (fruit)|olives]]. < ref name=Kochilas1993/ >  Paximathia used to be baked outdoors in [[oven]]s around every ten to fifteen days, after which the bread would be sliced into thick [[wedge]]s and put back into the ovens to dry. < ref name=Kochilas1999/ > < ref name=Kochilas1993/ >  They were an important food for the people of [[Crete]]. < ref name=Kremezi/ > 
 
 ==Making and types== 
 Paximathia are made with wheat, chickpea, or barley-flour. < ref name=Kochilas1999/ >  Other ingredients used may include [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[vegetable oil]], [[cinnamon]], [[Clove|cloves]], and orange zest. < ref > {{harvnb|Quintner|2005}}. < /ref >  Today, paximathia are usually baked overnight in ovens that have been turned off, whereby the bread is cooked from the remaining heat. < ref name=Kochilas1993/ >  This method cooks the bread to a dry state without creating brittleness that can cause crumbling. < ref name=Kochilas1993/ >  Paximathia is sometimes broken into pieces and served in salads after being moistened. < ref name=Kochilas1993/ > 
 
 Paximathia are in ''dakos'', which is a Greek salad made on the island of Crete. In [[Crete]], a type of paximathi called a ''koulouri'' is ring-shaped and served dried with olive oil, [[oregano]] and grated [[tomato]]. < ref name=Kochilas1999/ >  ''Eptazymo'' is another type of paximathi made with chickpeas. < ref name=Kochilas1993/ >
