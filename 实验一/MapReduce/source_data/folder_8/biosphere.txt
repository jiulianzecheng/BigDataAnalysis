 The '''biosphere''' includes everything living on [[Earth]]. It is also known as '''ecosphere'''. Currently the biosphere has a [[biomass]] (or amount of living things) at around 1900 [[giga]][[tonnes]] of [[carbon]]. It is not certain exactly how thick the biosphere is, though scientists predict that it is around 12,500 meters. The biosphere extends to the upper areas of [[Atmosphere of Earth|the atmosphere]], including birds and insects. 
 
 In a general sense, biospheres are any closed, [[self-regulating]] [[systems]] containing [[ecosystems]]. This includes artificial biospheres such as [[Biosphere 2]] and [[BIOS-3]], and potentially ones on other planets or moons. < ref name =  " webdictionary.co.uk " > {{cite web| title = Meaning of biosphere| work = WebDictionary.co.uk| publisher = WebDictionary.co.uk| url = http://www.webdictionary.co.uk/definition.php?query=biosphere| accessdate = 2010-11-12}} < /ref > 
 
 == Origin of the term == 
 The word  " biosphere "  was coined by geologist [[:en:Eduard_Suess|Eduard Suess]] in 1875. Which he defined as a place on Earth's surface where life dwells. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Origin of the Alps|last=Suess E.|publisher=|year=1875|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=}} < /ref > 
 
 == Earth's biosphere == 
 The earliest known evidence of life in Earth includes [[:en:Biogenic_substance|biogenic]] [[:en:Graphite|graphite]] dated as far as 3.7 Billion years old. < ref > {{Cite journal|author1=Bell, Elizabeth A.|author2=Boehnike, Patrick|author3=Harrison, T.

 == Extent of biological life == 
 Almost all parts of the planet contains a life of some kind. Recent advances in microbiology concluded that microbes can live deep beneath the Earth's surface.
