 '''Polyester''' is a type of [[man-made]] [[material]]. It is a synthetic [[polymer]]. With 18% [[market share]] of all [[plastic]] materials produced, it is third after [[polyethylene]] (33.5%) and [[polypropylene]] (19.5%). 
 
 == Uses == 
 Polyester can be made into thread , yarn or clothes .

These include shirts, trousers, pants, jackets, hats, bedding and upholstered [[furniture]]. Polyester fiber is used as cushioning and insulating material in pillows, comforters and upholstery padding. It can be used in [[curtain]]s to insulate windows and keep heat indoors. Polyester is used to make insulating [[carpet]]. 
 
 Industrial polyester [[fibers]], yarns and [[rope]]s are used in [[tire]]s, fabrics for their use, and safety belts.

 Polyester is a type of [[polymer]] that has the [[ester]] [[functional group]] in its main chain. There are many different polyesters. The term  " polyester "  as a specific material most often refers to [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET). Polyesters include [[chemical]]s found in nature, such as in plant [[cuticle]]s. Synthetics made by [[step-growth polymerization]] such as [[polycarbonate]] and [[polybutyrate]] are also polyesters. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are [[biodegradable]], but most synthetic polyesters are not. 
 
 The most common polyesters are [[thermoplastic]]s. < ref > {{Citation|last1 = Rosato|first1 = Dominick V.|last2 = Rosato|first2 = Donald V.|title = Plastic product material and process selection handbook|publisher = Elsevier|page= 85|year = 2004|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Lqk5QgGoWFkC|isbn = 9781856174312|last3 = Rosato|first3 = Matthew V.}} < /ref > 
 
 === Synthesis === 
 Most polyesters are made with a polycondensation reaction. See  " [[condensation reaction]]s in polymer chemistry " . 
 The general equation for the reaction of a diol with a diacid is : 
 :(n+1) R(OH) < sub > 2 < /sub >  + n R´(COOH) < sub > 2 < /sub >  → HO[ROOCR´COO] < sub > n < /sub > ROH + 2n pH < sub > 2 < /sub > O 
 
 An [[alcohol]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] react to form a carboxylic ester. 
 To assemble a polymer, the water formed by the reaction must be continually removed by [[azeotrope]] distillation.
