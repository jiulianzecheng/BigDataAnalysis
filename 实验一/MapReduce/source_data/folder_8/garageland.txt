 The Clash responded immediately by writing the song 'Garageland'. < ref > {{cite book |last=Salewicz |first=Chris |title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer |year=2006 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_fV3Oqn6o0C & q=garageland+clash & pg=PA162 |isbn=9780571211784 |oclc=76794852 |page=162 }} < /ref >   The opening verses are:  " ''Back in the garage with my bullshit detector'' / ''[[Carbon monoxide]] makes sure it's effective'' " , followed by the chorus:  " ''We're a garage band'' / ''We come from garageland'' " , and concluding with  " ''Back in the garage'' " . < ref > {{Cite book |last1=Coon |first1=Caroline |title=1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion |url=http://homepage.mac.com/blackmarketclash/Bands/Clash/Clash%20gigography/1976%20DATES.html |accessdate=2011-09-19 |year=1977 |publisher=Hawthorn |location=[[London]] |isbn=0801561299 |oclc=79262599 |archive-date=2007-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026052834/http://homepage.mac.com/blackmarketclash/Bands/Clash/Clash%20gigography/1976%20DATES.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
