 '''Chinchillas''' are either of two species (''[[Chinchilla chinchilla]]'' and ''[[Chinchilla lanigera]]'') of [[rodent]]s. They are most active at dawn and dusk. They are slightly larger and active than [[ground squirrel]]s, and are found in the [[Andes Mountains|Andes mountains]] in [[South America]]. < ref name=EB1911 > {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Chinchilla |volume=6 |page=232}} < /ref >  They live in colonies called  " [[herd]]s "  at high elevations of up to {{convert|4270|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

 ==Chinchilla species== 
 {{main|Chinchilla chinchilla|Chinchilla lanigera}}

 ==Habitat== 
 Chinchillas lived in the coastal regions, hills, and mountains of [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Argentina]] and [[Bolivia]]. In 1914, there was a decrease in population where scientists believed they were close to [[extinction]]. Populations in Chile were thought extinct by 1953, but the animal was found to inhabit an area in the [[Antofagasta Region]] in the late 1900s and early 2000s. 
 
 In their native habitats, chinchillas live in [[burrow]]s or holes in rocks. They can jump up to {{convert|6|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Their predators in the wild include [[birds of prey]], [[skunk]]s, [[felidae|feline]]s, [[snakes]] and [[canidae|canines]]. Chinchillas have many defensive movements including spraying [[urine]] and releasing fur if bitten. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://fantasticchinchillas.com/6.html | title=Is a Chinchilla the pet for me? | publisher=Fantastic Chinchillas | access-date=2008-02-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080112102402/http://fantasticchinchillas.com/6.html| archive-date = January 12, 2008}} < /ref >  In the wild, chinchillas have been observed eating [[plant]] leaves, [[fruit]]s, [[seed]]s, and small [[insect]]s. < ref name= " bm " > {{cite web | url=http://brainmuseum.org/Specimens/rodentia/chinchilla/index.html | title=Chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) | publisher=Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections | access-date=2008-02-01 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Groups=== 
 In nature, chinchillas live in social groups that look like colonies, but are properly called [[herd]]s. Herd sizes can have 14 members up to 100, this is both for social interaction as well as protection from predators. < ref > {{cite web|title=Chinchilla Habitat|url=http://www.chinchillachronicles.com/chinchilla_habitat.html|website=Chinchilla Chronicles|access-date=13 February 2016}} < /ref >  They can breed any time of the year. Their [[gestation]] period is 111 days, longer than most rodents. They can have long pregnancies, which is why chinchillas are born fully furred and with eyes open. Litters are usually small in number, usually two. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.chinchilla-lexikon.de/chinchilla-site-in-english.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204081559/http://www.chinchilla-lexikon.de/chinchilla-site-in-english.htm#The%20Chinchilla | archive-date=2008-02-04 | title=The Chinchilla | publisher=Chinchilla Lexicon | date=2003-05-01 | access-date=2008-02-01 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Conservation== 
 Both species of chinchilla are currently listed as [[endangered species|Endangered]] by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because of large population loss roughly at a 90% global population loss over the last 15 years. < ref name= " iucn " / >  The population decrease has been caused by chinchilla hunting by humans. Until 1996, they were listed as Indeterminate on the IUCN Red List. In 2006, the subspecies was listed as  " [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] "  while the short-tailed subspecies was listed as  " [[Critically Endangered]] " . By 2008, both were listed as  " Critically Endangered " , and in 2016 they were reclassified as  " Endangered "  due to some recovery in some areas. < ref name= " short-tailed " > {{cite iucn |title=Short-tailed chinchilla |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/4651/22191157 |access-date=15 November 2019}} < /ref > < ref name= " long-tailed " > {{cite iucn |title=Long-tailed Chinchilla |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/4652/117975205 |access-date=15 November 2019}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Roles with humans== 
 ===Fur industry=== 
 Chinchilla [[fur trade]] on an international level goes back to the [[16th century]]. Their fur is popular due because of its soft feel, which are mainly used in [[coat]]s. A single, full-length coat made from chinchilla fur may require as many as 150 [[fur|pelts]], as chinchillas are relatively small. < ref > Alderton, David. ''Rodents of the World'', 1996, page 20. {{ISBN|0-8160-3229-7}} < /ref >  Their use for fur led to the extinction of one species, and put serious pressure on the other two. Though it is illegal to hunt wild chinchillas, they are about to be extinct because of continued [[poaching]]. Domesticated chinchillas are still bred for fur. < ref > [http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/trade_chinchillas.php Chinchillas Endangered Species Handbook] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208055016/http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/trade_chinchillas.php |date=2009-12-08 }}.

 ===As pets=== 
 The domestic chinchilla are related to the ''[[Chinchilla lanigera]],'' the long-tailed Chinchilla, and the more common one in the wild after the other species, ''[[Chinchilla chinchilla]]'', or short-tailed Chinchilla, has been hunted nearly to extinction. Domestic chinchillas have thinner bodies, longer tails and larger ears. 
 
 Chinchillas are popular pets, though they need a large amount of exercise and dental care, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bri.pollard/Teeth.htm |title=Teeth |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |access-date=2009-07-30| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080503064106/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/bri.pollard/Teeth.htm| archive-date = May 3, 2008}} < /ref >  because their teeth continually growing throughout their life span. Since they cannot [[sweat]], they need a temperature-controlled environment as they can have [[heat stroke]]s. < ref > [http://www.chin-chillas.com/heat_stroke.html Heat Stroke]. Chin-chillas.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-07. < /ref > 
 
 The animals instinctively clean their fur by taking dust baths, in which they roll around in special dust made of [[pumice]], a few times a week and they do not bathe in water. Their thick fur protects them from getting [[fleas]], and reduces loose dander. < ref > [http://www.petstation.com/chins.htm Chinchillas: The keystone cops of rodents!]. Petstation.com (1995-03-01).

 ===In scientific research=== 
 Chinchillas have been used in research since the 1950s. Since the 1970s, the main interest in chinchillas by researchers is their [[auditory system]]. < ref name= " Suckow " > {{cite book|last1=Suckow|first1=Mark A.|last2=Stevens|first2=Karla A.|last3=Wilson|first3=Ronald P.|title=The Laboratory Rabbit, Guinea Pig, Hamster, and Other Rodents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEs-xsYp6IC & pg=PA949|year=2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123809209|page=949ff}} < /ref >  Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of [[Chagas disease]], [[gastrointestinal diseases]], [[pneumonia]], and [[listeriosis]], as well as of ''[[Yersinia]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' infections. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~jam6/science.html | title=In Scientific Research | publisher=University of Maryland, Baltimore County | access-date=2008-02-01 | archive-date=2013-12-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060648/http://userpages.umbc.edu/~jam6/science.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >
