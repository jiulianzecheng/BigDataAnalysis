 '''Chivalry''' is a word from [[Old French]] in [[medieval]] times when it meant the use of a horse, thus [[cavalry]] and [[knighthood]]. Later, it meant the qualities of [[honour]] and [[love]]. Today, the terms ''chivalry'' and ''chivalrous'' are used to describe courteous behavior, especially that of men towards women.
