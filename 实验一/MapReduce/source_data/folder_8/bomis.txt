 Bomis was popular for hosting entertainment-, sports- and sexual-themed sites. When Nupedia started, [[Larry Sanger]] was hired to be the editor-in-chief for the project. But Nupedia resulted too slow to grow and too expensive to maintain, and Wikipedia was started as a side project to help Nupedia grow. In the end, Wikipedia became more popular than Nupedia; it closed in 2003 and Wikipedia was transferred to the newly created [[Wikimedia Foundation]] in 2003. Bomis closed in 2006.
