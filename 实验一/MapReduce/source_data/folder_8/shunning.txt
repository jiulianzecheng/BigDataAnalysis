'''Shunning''' is the [[social rejection|rejection]] of a person. It is usual in some [[religion|religious groups]] to cut people off if they do not believe the beliefs or follow the rules of the group. It has been used in industrial action ([[Strike action|strikes]]) and as a punishment in certain societies. 
 
 == Religions which use or have used shunning == 
 * The Catholic Church, before the Code of [[Canon Law]] of 1983. The practice of [[inquisition]] is famous. Other religious and quasi-religious groups which use the practice are: 
 * [[Amish]]. < ref > [https://amishamerica.com/why-do-the-amish-practice-shunning/ Why do the Amish practice shunning?] < /ref > 
 * [[Jehova's Witnesses]]. Holden says that many keep affiliation out of fear of being shunned and losing contact with friends and family members. < ref > Holden, Andrew 2002. ''Jehovah's Witnesses: portrait of a contemporary religious movement''. London: Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-26610-9  (p250/270) < /ref > 
 * [[Church of Scientology]]. The Church of Scientology asks its members to quit all communication with Suppressive Persons (those whom the Church deems antagonistic to Scientology). The practice of shunning in Scientology is termed disconnection. In the United States, the Church has tried to argue in court that disconnection is a constitutionally protected religious practice. However, this argument was rejected because the pressure put on individual Scientologists to disconnect means it is not voluntary. < ref > California appellate court, 2nd district, 7th division, Wollersheim v.

 == Tax implications == 
 In many countries, religions get huge financial advantages by being recognised as religions. They are not [[tax]]ed, or have much reduced taxes. In the United States, the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[US Constitution]] prevents the [[US government]] and (through the Bill of Rights) the 50 [[US state|state]] governments from imposing church taxes. In 1947, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled  that  " No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. " < ref > {{cite web | url = https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-01/02-establishment-of-religion.html#tc-59 | title = Establishment of Religion | website = [[Justia]] | access-date = July 3, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180703133306/https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-01/02-establishment-of-religion.html#tc-59 | archive-date = July 3, 2018 | url-status = live }} < /ref >  This explains why organisations such as [[Scientology]] wish to be classified as religions.
