 '''Bullfinches''' are a [[genus]] of [[passerine]] birds in the [[finch]] family ([[Fringillidae]]). They belong to the genus '''''Pyrrhula'''''.  
 
 The genus has a [[palearctic]] distribution. All species occur in Asia with two species exclusively in the [[Himalayas]] and one species, ''P. pyrrhula'', also occurring in Europe. The [[Azores bullfinch]] (''P. murina'') is a critically [[endangered species]] (about 120 pairs remaining), occurring only in the east of the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] in the [[Azores]] [[archipelago]].  
 
 Analysis of the [[mitochondria]]l DNA [[cytochrome|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] indicates that the [[holarctic]] [[pine grosbeak]] (''Pinicola enucleator'') is the sister group to the ancestor of the bullfinches. < ref > Arnaiz-Villena A ''et al.'' 2001.

 The [[evolution]] of the bullfinch species started soon after the pine grosbeak's ancestors diverged from them (at the end of the middle [[Miocene]], about a [[dozen]] million years ago (mya). It is fairly certain is that the bullfinch radiation started in the general area of the [[Himalayas]]. The [[mountain finch]]es also seem to be part of this [[clade]]. < ref > Marten, Jill A.  &  Johnson, Ned K. 1986. Genetic relationships of North American cardueline finches.

 Bullfinches have glossy black wings and tail feathers. They show a white rump. The legs and feet are fleshy brown. Their short, swollen bill is adapted to eat buds, and is black except in ''P. nipalensis'', which has a yellowish bill. The males can be distinguished by their orange or red breast. Some species have a black cap. 
 
 Probably most populations are partially [[Migration|migratory]]. Most migrants move short or medium distances. North European birds move within a wider compass than central European birds. Numbers migrating show marked annual fluctuations; no link with any particular food source has been established. Autumn migration begins late, and is fairly brief, mostly October–November; spring migration February–April. 
 
 The Eurasian bullfinch population in Britain has been in serious decline since the mid-1970s; numbers have fallen by 62 per cent in 35 years. Data suggests that productivity has increased over the last decade, and [[nest]] failure rates at the chick stage (15 days) have fallen from 37% to 21%.
