 '''Bread''' is a type of [[Baking|baked]] [[food]]. It is mainly made from [[dough]], which is made mainly from [[flour]] and [[water]]. Usually, [[sodium chloride|salt]] and [[yeast]] are added. Bread is often baked in an [[oven]]. It can be bought all over the world. 
 
 Bread can be [[toast]]ed or used to make [[sandwich]]es.  [[Pizza]] is a food-based on bread. There are many different kinds of bread.  
 
 The two main types of bread are: 
 # Leavened bread is made by adding yeast or other [[leavening agent]]s to the dough. The yeast produces gas that makes the dough lighter. Leavened bread can be made into larger loaves baked in an oven. This is the main type of bread eaten in [[Europe]], [[United States|America]], and many parts of [[Asia]]. 
 # {{anchor|unleavened}}Unleavened flatbread is baked from a dough of water and flour, with no yeast. It is baked in flat rounds like [[tortilla]] or [[chapati]]. This type of bread cannot be made thick as it would be too dense to eat. Unleavened bread is eaten throughout [[Greece]], [[Africa]], parts of [[Asia]], and as the [[Central America]] such as [[Pitta]] bread or tortilla. Baking can be done on a metal plate or hot stone, or in an oven.

 The color and taste of the bread depending on the kind of flour used and the style of baking. Flour made from the whole grain gives darker bread. Flour made just from the polished wheat grain gives a very white bread. Rye and barley flour give darker types of bread. The type of flour also changes how long the bread can be kept before going bad. Some [[strain]]s of wheat are [[resistant]] to [[fungus]], but may not produce bread as tasty as a weaker strain. 
 
 == Religious breads == 
 [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] have rules about the use of bread in their religions. Unleavened bread ([[matzo]]) is eaten by Jews during the [[Passover]]. The [[Catholic]] celebration of the [[Eucharist]] uses unleavened wafers. 
 
 [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches forbid the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist ([[Old Testament]]) and permit leavened bread only as a symbol of the [[New Testament|New]]. This was one of the three points of contention that brought about the [[East-West Schism|schism]] between [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Western]] churches in 1054. < ref > {{Citation|last = Ware|first = Timothy|author-link = |title = The Orthodox Church|place = London|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1964|page =66|isbn = 0-14-020592-6}} < /ref >
