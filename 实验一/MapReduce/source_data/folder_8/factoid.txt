 '''Factoid''' is stating a fact that is not backed up by evidence.  The factoid may not be trusted because 
 :(a) it is actually false, or 
 :(b) because evidence to support it cannot be checked. 
 Factoids become widely treated as if they were true. < ref > Pratkanis, Anthony R. (2001). ''Age of Propaganda: the Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion,'' p. 104. < /ref >     
 
 In 1973, the term ''factoid'' was created and first used by [[Norman Mailer]]. < ref > Winslow, Donald J. (1995). ''Life-writing: a Glossary of Terms in Biography, Autobiography, and Related Forms,'' p. 24; citing [[Norman Mailer|Mailer, Norman]]. (1973). ''Marilyn: A Biography'', p. 63. < /ref >   
 
 A factoid is  " an item of unreliable information which is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as a fact " . < ref > Simpson, J.A. ''et al.'' (2008). ''The Compact Oxford English Dictionary''. < /ref >   The most important thing is that the factoid is widely believed. < ref > Rollyson, Carl Edmund. (1993). ''Marilyn Monroe: a life of the actress,'' p. 36; excerpt,  " the most mysterious property of a factoid [a fiction that masquerades or functions as a fact] is that it is believed by the people who put together the factoid next to it. " < /ref >    
 
 A factoid refers to something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact. < ref > Pruden, Wesley. [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/pruden071503.asp   " The Fearsome Reality of the Surreal, " ] ''Jewish World Review'' (US). July 15, 2003. < /ref >
