 The '''Ocicat''' is a [[cat breeds|breed]] of [[cat]]. It looks like a [[wild cat]] but has no wild [[DNA]] in its [[gene pool]]. The Ocicat is spotted like a wild cat but is tame and has the behavior of a [[domesticated|domestic]] animal. It got its name because it looks like an [[ocelot]]. The breed started accidentally by mating [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]]s and [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian]]s. Later, [[American Shorthair]]s (silver [[tabby cat]]s) were added to the mix. This gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and patterns. Now, the Ocicat is a popular breed all over the world.

The Ocicat's large, muscled body gives them a look of power and strength. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ocicatinfo.com/Ocicolors2.htm |title=Ocicat Colors |date=12 October 2008 |accessdate=1 March 2009 |publisher=Cat Fanciers' Association |archive-date=3 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403071401/http://www.ocicatinfo.com/Ocicolors2.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Behavior == 
 Most Ocicats are friendly and are not shy.  This makes them good family pets. Most can also get along well with other animals. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.acfacat.com/ocicat_synopsis.htm |title=American Cat Fanciers Association |publisher=Acfacat.com |date=2013-12-31 |accessdate=2014-08-06 |archive-date=2016-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706203353/http://www.acfacat.com/ocicat_synopsis.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Their mood and actions are similar to those of a dog.  Most can be trained to fetch toys, walk on a leash, come when called, and other dog-related tricks. < ref name=mckee2001/ >   Some even like the water. They are playful and like toys very much. So these pets need attention from their owners. 
 
 == History == 
 The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ocicatinfo.com/daly.htm |title=Ocicat Information - The site for the Ocicat! |publisher=Ocicatinfo.com |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2014-08-06 |archive-date=2014-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216143705/http://www.ocicatinfo.com/daly.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  in [[Michigan]], who tried to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. Her kittens looked like Abyssinians. But when they were later mated, there was not only an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese, but a spotted kitten,Tonga. The breeder's daughter, nicknamed Tonga an 'ocicat'. Tonga was sold as a pet, but his parent cats had more spotted kittens. This began the Ocicat breed. < ref name= " mckee2001 " > {{Cite book|last=McKee |first=Bill |title=The Guide to Owning an Ocicat |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoowningoci0000mcke |publisher=TFH Publications |location=Neptune City, New Jersey |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7938-2195-9 |oclc=47037281}} < /ref >  Other breeders then also did the same steps. They mated Siamese cats to Abyssinians, and then those cat [[wikt:descendant|descendents]] to Siameses to get Ocicat kittens. The Ocicat was accepted in The Cat Fanciers' Association and was first shown for championships in 1987. < ref name= " thompson1999 " > {{Cite book|first=Stephanie |last=Thompson |title=The Ocicat |publisher=Stephanie Thompson |location=Buenva Vista, CO |year=1999 |pages=14â€“15}} < /ref >
