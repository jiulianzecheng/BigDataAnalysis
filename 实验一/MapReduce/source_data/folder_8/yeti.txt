 The '''Yeti''' (also called the '''abominable snowman''') is an animal said to live in the [[Himalaya]] mountain range made of ice. People say they have seen it, but none have ever been caught. It is supposed to look like an [[ape]] that walks upright. Some body parts, said to be of a yeti, are kept in a few [[monastery|monasteries]] in the area. There no real evidence that it exists, but there have been reports of footprints in the snow which could have been made by a yeti. 
 
 ==Description== 
 The yeti has been described as having white shaggy fur and a lean [[wikt:muscular|muscular]] body like an ape. This  " creature "  could also live in the [[Asia]]n mountains near the Himalayan snow line. Stories about the Yeti and another similar creature, [[Bigfoot]], suggest that if they are real, they could be the same, or similar [[species]]. The yeti can stand at least 6 â€“ 10 foot tall, not as tall as the Bigfoot. It has also been said the Yeti can weigh at least 200 - 400 pounds. The yeti is shy, which is why it has never been found. In 2010 an unsuccessful exhibition, some hunters found a hairless four legged creature, they said was a Yeti. It was a small hairless cat that lost it's hair from a disease. 
 
 ==Popular culture== 
 The yeti has been shown in couple of movies including [[Monsters, Inc.]] The Yeti has also been a [[WWE]] wrestler name. Toys and games using creatures like yetis have been made including Lego Cards ([[Lego]]).
