 '''Britpop''' is a type of [[alternative rock]] that started in the [[United Kingdom]]. Britpop came out of the British [[Indie (music)|independent music]] scene of the 1990s and affected, or changed, by British [[guitar]] [[pop music]] of the 1960s and 1970s. This kind of music began as a reaction against some trends, or styles, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as [[Grunge music|grunge]] from the [[United States]]. After [[United States|American]] grunge [[band]]s such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] came to Britain, many British bands acted as opposites to the American bands, and wrote about only British topics and concerns. 
 
 Britpop bands did not have one type of sound, but the [[media]] called them first a 'scene', or short-lasting trend. Later, the media called them a national importance. [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] had been called the most important bands. < ref > Blur, Oasis and Pulp were the main subjects of John Dower's 2003 documentary ''Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Britpop'' and a review of ''[[Different Class]]'' recalls the  " holy Britpop triumvirate "  of Oasis, Blur and Pulp; Garry Mulholland; Q magazine, September 2006; p116 < /ref >  Some bands were able to become popular overseas.But Britpop was mostly gone by the end of the decade.
