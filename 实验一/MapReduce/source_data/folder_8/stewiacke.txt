 '''Stewiacke''' is a [[town]] located in southern [[Colchester County, Nova Scotia|Colchester County]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. The town was incorporated on August 30, 1906. 
 
 ==History== 
 Stewiacke was named in the language of the local [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]] [[First Nations]] and is a word meaning  " flowing out in small streams "  and  " winding river "  or  " whimpering or whining as it goes " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mnh/nature/nhns2/500/511.htm|title=Museum, Government of Nova Scotia - 511 Windsor Lowlands|access-date=2009-04-19|publisher=Museum.gov.ns.ca|archive-date=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522030444/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mnh/nature/nhns2/500/511.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  During the [[French and Indian War]], the British built [[Fort Ellis (Nova Scotia)|Fort Ellis]] in the area to protect New England Planters from Mi'kmaq raids.

 In the late 1990s, a tourism attraction named Mastodon Ridge opened near the town's highway exit, based on a local discovery of a [[mastodon]] skeleton. The Mastodon Ridge Complex features a craft store, toy store, a mini golf and [[interpretive centre]] which displays several of the mastodon's bones. 
 
 Stewiacke is home to two bars, a pharmacy, a grocery store, a pizza store, numerous fast food restaurants, two gas stations, a hardware store, an audio-visual production company, an 18-hole golf course and a newly built elementary school that replaced two former local schools. 
 
 Stewiacke is also home to a volunteer fire department that was the first department in North America to use specialized foam as a fire suppression agent. Alongside other achievements involving the use of certain fire apparatus. 
 
 The town is noted as being located halfway between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]] (Actually in Alton, Nova Scotia). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.burnsidenews.com/index.cfm?sid=106007 & sc=397|title=The Burnside News - Burnside entrepreneur to develop Stewiacke industrial park|access-date=2009-04-19|publisher=BurnsideNews.com|archive-date=2009-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416031611/http://www.burnsidenews.com/index.cfm?sid=106007 & sc=397|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   Controversy in the past over this claim stems from the fact that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and therefore the halfway mark lies approximately 16 & nbsp;km North of the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2000JRASC..94...48B/0000048.000.html|title=Midway from the Equator to the North Pole - Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|access-date=2009-04-19|publisher=Harvard.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 The town's most notorious event occurred on Friday April 12, 2001, when a local teenager, at home on a school in-service day, tampered with a railway switch on the [[Canadian National Railway|CN Rail]] [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]-[[Montreal]] mainline, causing [[Via Rail Canada]]'s ''[[Ocean (passenger train)|Ocean]]'' to derail several minutes later when it passed through the centre of the community. < ref name= " cbc1 " > {{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/11/06/via_derail021106.html|title=Youth sentenced to six months for derailing train|access-date=2009-04-19|publisher=CBC.ca | date=2002-11-06}} < /ref >   Several buildings and rail cars were destroyed and many people were injured, including some severely, although no fatalities resulted. < ref name= " cbc1 " / > < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/08/29/stewiacke_020829.html|title=Teen faces victims of N.S. train wreck|access-date=2009-04-19|publisher=CBC.ca | date=2002-08-30}} < /ref > 
 
 The town is located in the [[Stewiacke Valley]] at the confluence of the [[Stewiacke River|Stewiacke]] and [[Shubenacadie River]] and is a service and support centre for local agricultural communities as well as a service exit on [[Nova Scotia Highway 102|Highway 102]].
