In [[Greek mythology]], '''Eudoros''' ({{lang-el|Εὔδωρος}}) was one of the [[Myrmidons]] as well as the second of five commanders who served under [[Achilles]] during the [[Trojan War]]. He was a demigod, son of [[Hermes]] and [[Polymele]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Eudorus {{!}} Facts, Information, and Mythology|url=https://pantheon.org/articles/e/eudorus.html|access-date=2021-11-16|website=pantheon.org}} < /ref > 
 
 According to the [[Iliad]], he commanded ten penteconters and five hundred [[Myrmidons]]. In Book XVI of the Iliad, when [[Patroclus]] readies Achilles's men, Homer talks about him for fourteen lines - more than any of the other commanders in this passage. He is also the second most notable of the five, beaten only by Phoenix.{{fact|date=September 2022}}
