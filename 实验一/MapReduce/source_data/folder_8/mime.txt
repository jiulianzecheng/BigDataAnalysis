 '''Mime''' is a type of acting that does not use [[word]]s or speech. Mime is all about physical movement and exaggerating your expressions. '''Mimes''' (people who practice mime) must use their [[action]]s to send a [[Wikt:message|message]] or tell a story. They are not allowed to speak directly to the audience. 
 
 Probably the most well-known mime was [[Marcel Marceau]]. Mime originates from [[Rome]] and [[Greece]]. Some people also believe that cavemen used mime to communicate as they could not talk.
