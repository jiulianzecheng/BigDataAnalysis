 A '''sepoy''' was an Indian footsoldier (of whatever religion) in the [[East India Company]] army or the [[British Indian Army]]. The term comes from the [[Persian language]]  " Sipahi " . The term ''sipahi'' was also used for cavalry soldiers in the army of the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuks]] and the [[Ottomans]]. 
 
 In the modern [[Indian Army]], [[Pakistan Army]], [[Bangladesh Army]] and [[Nepalese Army]], it is still used for the rank of [[private (rank)|private]] soldier. < ref > John Keegan, ''Armies of the World'', pages 312 and 545. {{ISBN|0-333-17236-1}} < /ref >
