 [[File:Enclave.svg|right|frame|C is A's enclave and B's [[exclave]].]] 
 In general use, an '''enclave''' can be any special area of a bigger area of land, such as a part of a [[city]] that has different [[tax]]es than the rest of the city. 
 
 In [[politics|political]] [[geography]], an '''enclave''' is a piece of land which has a different [[country]] totally around it. If another country has [[sovereignty]] over it, it is also called an ''[[exclave]]'' of that other country.  It is usually landlocked, meaning it is completely encased by the surrounding country 
 
 Exclaves can also exist within a country. This is when some administrative regions have ''holes'' (of other such regions) in them. 
 
 The word ''enclave'' is a relatively new word in the language of [[diplomacy]]: Diplomats are used to speaking [[French language|French]]. The word comes from late [[Latin]] ''inclavatus'', which can be translated as ''shut in, locked up'' (with a key, from Latin ''clavis'', key). The word got in the English language in the year [[1868]]. ''exclave'' (with a similar meaning) followed 3 [[decade]]s later. 
 
 Enclaves may be created for a variety of [[history|historical]], [[political]] or [[geography|geographical]] reasons. Some areas have been left as enclaves simply because a [[river]] changed its course. 
 
 Since living in an enclave can be very inconvenient and many agreements have to be found by both countries over mail addresses, power supply or passage rights, enclaves tend to be eliminated and many cases that existed before have now been removed. Sometimes it is the case, that enclaves are traded for one another. 
 
 In [[England|English]] [[Church]] history, subnational enclaves were known as '''peculiars''' (see also [[Royal Peculiar]]).

 Some enclaves are countries that are not part of any other country, and therefore not [[exclave]]s. Three such countries exist: 
 * The republic of [[San Marino]], enclaved within [[Italy]] 
 * [[Vatican City]], within the city of [[Rome]], in Italy 
 * The Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], inside [[South Africa]]
