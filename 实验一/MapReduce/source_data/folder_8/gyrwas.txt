 '''Gyrwas''' (also called '''Gyrwe''') was the name of an early [[Anglo-Saxon]] people. They lived mainly on the western edge of  the grassy [[wetlands]] called the [[Fens]] in eastern [[England]]. They were divided into two tribal groups; the northern Gyrwas and the southern Gyrwas. This is how they were recorded in the [[Tribal Hidage]].{{efn|Called the ''Norþ gyrwa'' (North Gyrwas) and the ''Suþ gyrwa'' (South Gyrwas) they were each listed in the Tribal Hidage at ''syx hund hyda'' (six hundred hides).}} 
 
 The name Gyrwe means 'fen-dweller'. < ref name=Blair183 > Peter Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain and Early England; 55 B.C.–A.D. 871'' (New York; London: W. W.

The Fens supplied the Gyrwas with fish and [[:en:wikt:gamebirds|gamebirds]] but they lived on the drier lands and islands nearby. < ref name=Blair183/ > 
 
 The Gyrwas had their own leaders as late as the first half of the [[7th century]]. < ref name=Chadwick437 > Hector Munro Chadwick, ''The Early Cultures of North-West Europe'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 437 < /ref >  [[Bede]] records a Tondbert, ''priceps''{{efn|The [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''princeps'' is sometimes translated as '[[prince]]' but in this case the word means [[:wikt:leader|leader]]. The ''Liber Eliensis'' calls him an [[ealdorman]] which is also an interpretation of ''princeps''. < ref name=Fairweather17/ > }} of the South Gyrwas. < ref name=Bede236 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans.

Janet Fairweather (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2004), p. 17 < /ref >  Tondbert died shortly after the wedding and Ethelreda was then given in marriage to [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]]. < ref name=Bede236/ >  [[:en:wikt:underkings|Underkings]] and leaders of tribes like the Gyrwas probably did not claim descent from ancient [[Germanic paganism|Germanic gods]], as many kings of the [[:en:wikt:heptarchy|heptarchy]] did. But they were of high enough status to marry Anglo-Saxon royalty. < ref > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 47 < /ref > 
 
 For a time the territory of the Gyrwas formed a [[:en:wikt:buffer|buffer state]] between the [[Mercia|Mercians]] and the [[East Anglia|East Anglians]]. The Gyrwas were later absorbed into [[Middle Angles|Middle Anglia]]. < ref name=Chadwick437/ >
