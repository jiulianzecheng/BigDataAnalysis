 '''Ketamine''' is a [[dissociative]] [[anesthetic]]. It is a type of drug a doctor might give to put someone to sleep for an operation. Ketamine can  also be used as a [[painkiller]] and a bronchodilator (which makes it easier for air to get into your [[lungs]]). < ref > {{Cite book |last1=Peck |first1=T. E. |last2=Hill |first2=S. A. |last3=Williams |first3=M. |year=2008 |page=[https://archive.org/details/pharmacologyfora00peck_065/page/n123 111] |title=Pharmacology for anaesthesia and intensive care |url=https://archive.org/details/pharmacologyfora00peck_065 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-70463-2|edition=3rd }} < /ref >   
 Sometimes it can lead to a special type of [[hallucination]] which makes you feel detached from yourself and the things around you < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Bergman |first=S. A. |title=Ketamine: review of its pharmacology and its use in pediatric anesthesia |journal=Anesthesia Progress |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=10–20 |year=1999 |pmid=10551055 |pmc=2148883}} < /ref >  which is why some people use it as a recreational drug. As it can have severe side effects, it is usually not available as an over-the-counter drug. 
 
 Ketamine was developed in 1962 as a rapid-acting dissociative anesthetic that was used in surgery. It was approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970. Unfortunately, abuse began along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and spread across the country by the 1980s. The illicit market produced new forms of the drug, available as powder, capsules, crystal rocks, tablets, and injectable solutions. The drug is largely abused intranasally (via sniffing) or orally. 
 
 ==Medical use== 
 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) lists ketamine as an essential medicine, especially as an anesthetic and analgesic. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Uses of Ketamine Powder as anesthetic|url=https://trippydelics.ca/en/psychedelics/24-ketamine-powder.html|access-date=2022-09-18|website=Trippy Way Psychedelics|language=en|archive-date=2022-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220920170746/https://trippydelics.ca/en/psychedelics/24-ketamine-powder.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  With medical supervision, ketamine is a better surgical anesthetic than many others, and it is safer for a wider range of patients. It is also the anesthetic of choice in veterinary surgery. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|title=Ketamine: Medical Uses, Abuse Risks|url=https://treatmentsolutions.com/drugs/ketamine/|access-date=2021-09-04|website=Treatment Solutions}} < /ref >  In medicine ketamine is normally injected into a [[vein]] or [[muscle]]. < ref name= " lankenau " > {{Cite journal|author=Lankenau SE|last2=Sanders B|last3=Bloom JJ|display-authors=etal|date=March 2007|title=First injection of ketamine among young injection drug users (IDUs) in three U.S. cities|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=87|issue=2–3|pages=183–93|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.08.015|pmc=1852477|pmid=16979848}} < /ref > 
 Ketamine is not the first anaesthetic a doctor would think of using in most situations because of the hallucinations it causes. On the other hand, while most anaesthetics suppress your breathing, resulting in the need for a machine to help you breathe, ketamine does not. < ref name= " heshmati " > {{Cite journal|author=Heshmati F|last2=Zeinali MB|last3=Noroozinia H|last4=Abbacivash R|last5=Mahoori A|date=December 2003|title=Use of ketamine in severe status asthmaticus in intensive care unit|journal=Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology|volume=2|issue=4|pages=175–80|doi=|pmid=17301376}} < /ref > 
 This can make it a useful anaesthetic when you don't have any equipment available, for example, in a war zone.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=December 2013}} 
 
 ==Side effects== 
 
 ===Short term=== 
 
 Short term side effects happen in about 40% of people and include: < ref name= " Quibell " > {{Cite journal|author=Quibell R|last2=Prommer EE|last3=Mihalyo M|display-authors=etal|date=March 2011|title= " Ketamine* " |journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|volume=41|issue=3|pages=640–649|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.01.001|pmid=21419322}} < /ref > 
 
 * Dizziness 
 * Double vision 
 * Euphoria 
 * Blurred vision 
 * Finding it hard to express emotions, not being very emotionally reactive 
 * High [[blood pressure]] 
 * [[Tachycardia|Fast heart beat]] 
 * [[Nausea|Feeling sick]] and vomiting 
 * Having trouble understanding or producing speech 
 * Nightmares 
 * Illusions 
 * Hallucinations 
 * Changed body image 
 * Impaired memory and attention 
 *Derealization, or losing touch with reality 
 *Muscle rigidity. 
 
 ===Long term=== 
 
 In the medical setting ketamine is only given a few times so most long term effects mentioned below are found in recreational ketamine users and animal models. < ref name=morgan11 > {{cite journal|title=Ketamine use: a review|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_british-journal-of-addiction_2012-01_107_1/page/27|journal=Addiction|date=1 January 2012|volume=107|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03576.x|pmid=21777321|last1=Morgan|first1=Celia J. A.|last2=Curran|first2=H. Valerie|author3=Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs}} < /ref > 
 
 ====Urinary tract effects==== 
 There are 110 reports of people with problems in their urinary tract due to using ketamine. < ref name=middela > {{cite journal|title=Ketamine-induced vesicopathy: a literature review|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|date=1 January 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=27–30|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02502.x|pmid=21155941|s2cid=25034266|last1=Middela|first1=S.|last2=Pearce|first2=I.}} < /ref > 
 
 Symptoms include: 
 
 * Urgently needing to urinate. 
 * Finding it painful to urinate and having [[blood]] in your [[urine]].  
 * Not being able to hold as much urine in your [[bladder]] 
 
 These urinary tract problems are most common in people who have abused ketamine daily for a long time. < ref name =morgan11 / > 
 
 ====Neurological effects==== 
 
 People who abuse ketamine a lot (more than 4 times a week) have been found to have impaired memory and increased depression when compared to people who don't abuse ketamine. Those who use ketamine less frequently (1-4 times per week)and those who had stopped taking ketamine showed no difference in the aforementioned parameters. This suggests that these problems with memory and mood do not affect infrequent users and might be reversible once ketamine use is stopped. < ref name= " Addiction Users Study " > {{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02761.x |pmid=19919593 |title=Consequences of chronic ketamine self-administration upon neurocognitive function and psychological wellbeing: a 1-year longitudinal study |year=2009 |last1=Morgan |first1=Celia J.

 One study has recently been done using monkeys as a model to see if ketamine is toxic to the brain. < ref name= " Cynomolgus monkey neurotoxiciy " > {{cite journal|title=Chronic ketamine exposure induces permanent impairment of brain functions in adolescent cynomolgus monkeys|journal=Addiction Biology|date=November 2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=185–194|doi=10.1111/adb.12004|pmid=23145560|s2cid=23028521|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/adb.12004/abstract|last1=Sun|first1=Lin|last2=Li|first2=Qi|last3=Li|first3=Qing|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuzhe|last5=Liu|first5=Dexiang|last6=Jiang|first6=Hong|last7=Pan|first7=Fang|last8=Yew|first8=David T.}} < /ref > 
 The study found that injecting the monkeys every day for 6 months with ketamine caused more cells to die in the [[pre-frontal cortex|front]] of their brain and also caused a decrease in activity in the areas of the brain which control movement. 
 
 ==Mechanism of action== 
 Ketamine is a NMDA antagonist in the CNS. By inhibiting NMDA receptors in inhibitiory neurons in the brain, it causes increased CNS activity and sympathomimetic effects. As a result, there is not only an anaesthetic effect, but also activation of the CNS unlike other anaesthetics. This is beneficial in surgical settings because it maintains blood pressure, airway reflexes, bronchioles remain dilated and airways patent. Making this a particularly useful drug in shock and surgery patients because of blood pressure maintained with ketamine use, unlike typical anaesthetics which cause decreased BP and respiratory suppression. 
 
 ==Research== 
 
 ===Treating addiction=== 
 One study by Evgeny Krupitsky has found that using ketamine along with psychotherapy and group therapy was a lot more effective at treating alcohol addiction than the traditional treatment. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.eleusis.us/resource-center/references/acamethod.php|title=The Combination of Psychedelic and Aversive Approaches in Alcoholism Treatment - Eleusis < !-- Bot generated title -- > |publisher=|access-date=2013-08-11|archive-date=2008-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618070239/http://eleusis.us/resource-center/references/acamethod.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 The same scientist found that ketamine might also be useful for treating heroin addiction. Patients who had been treated for their addiction with multiple sessions of ketamine fared much better than those who had only had one session of ketamine with abstinence rates of 50% and 22.2% respectively. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ketamine psychotherapy for heroin addiction:|url=http://www.eleusis.us/resource-center/references/ketamine-psychotherapy-heroin.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101131742/http://www.eleusis.us/resource-center/references/ketamine-psychotherapy-heroin.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-01|access-date=2013-08-11}} < /ref > 
 
 ===As an antidepressant=== 
 Some small studies have been done which found that a single dose of ketamine was able to improve treatment resistant depression after just a few hours with the effects lasting for one week. < ref > [http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/aug2006/nimh-07b.htm NIH.

 ===Complex regional pain syndrome=== 
 CRPS is a disease that causes severe pain and swelling, getting worse over time. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.marksandharrison.com/firm-news-press/|title=Firm News  &  Press Archive|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 Some studies have been done which suggest that ketamine might be useful as a painkiller for CRPS. < ref name= " pubmed16850072 " > {{Cite journal|author=Goldberg ME|last2=Domsky R|last3=Scaringe D|display-authors=etal|date=April 2005|title=Multi-day low dose ketamine infusion for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome|url=http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/linkout_vw.php?issn=1533-3159 & vol=8 & page=175|url-status=dead|journal=Pain Physician|volume=8|issue=2|pages=175–9|doi=10.36076/ppj.2005/8/175|pmid=16850072|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520192354/http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/linkout_vw.php?issn=1533-3159 & vol=8 & page=175|archive-date=2013-05-20|access-date=2013-08-11}} < /ref >
