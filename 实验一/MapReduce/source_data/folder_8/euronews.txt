 ==History== 
 In 1992, following the Persian Gulf War, during which rival cable and satellite international television news channel CNN's position as the preeminent source of 24-hour news programming was cemented, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) proposed a channel to present information from a counterpart European perspective. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/24/business/the-media-business-european-channel-takes-a-stab-at-cnn.html|date=24 February 1992|access-date=12 August 2020|work=The New York Times|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; European Channel Takes a Stab at CNN|first=Alan|last=Riding}} < /ref >  The inaugural Euronews broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Écully, Lyon. In 1996, an additional broadcast studio was set up in London. 
 
 In late 1997, the British news broadcaster ITN purchased a 49% share of Euronews for £5.1 million from Alcatel-Lucent. ITN supplied the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders. 
 
 In 1999, the broadcast switched from solely analogue to mainly digital transmission. The same year, a Portuguese audio track was added. 
 
 In 2001, the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK) acquired a 1.8% stake in SOCEMIE. A Russian-language service was launched later in the year. 
 
 In April 2003, ITN sold its stake in Euronews as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news-gathering rather than channel management. 
 
 On 6 February 2006, Ukrainian public broadcaster Natsionalna Telekompanya Ukraïny (NTU) purchased a one percent interest in SOCEMIE. 
 
 In 2007, Euronews won the European Commission's tender for an Arabic-language news channel, with a service agreement being signed on 6 December. The Arabic service would eventually be launched in July 2008. 
 
 On 27 May 2008, Spanish public broadcaster RTVE decided to leave Euronews, citing legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending as a factor influencing its decision to leave, as well as to promote its international channel TVE Internacional. 
 
 In February 2009, the Turkish public broadcaster TRT became a shareholder in the channel and joined its supervisory board. TRT purchased 15.70% of the channel's shares and became the fourth main partner after France Télévisions (23.93%), RAI (21.54%), and VGTRK (16.94%). Subsequently, Turkish was added as the ninth language service in January 2010. Later that year in October, the channel started broadcasting in Persian, then began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen format in early 2011, and launched a Ukrainian service in August. A Polish service was launched in mid-2011 amid Poland's accession to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, although only some selected evening broadcasts were translated. It was shortly after discontinued in January 2012. 
 
 In February 2015, the channel's executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks, owned by Egyptian telecom magnate Naguib Sawiris, to acquire a 53% controlling stake in the media outlet. The deal raised questions over Euronews's future editorial posture and independence. 
 
 On 13 March 2015, it was announced that Inter Media Group, owned by pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, had taken over the Ukrainian service. In response, the Ukrainian government decided to revoke its broadcasting license for its suspected bias and dropped its funding. Firtash later abandoned the project, resulting in the department shutting down and leaving 17 journalists redundant. The Russian service, which was financed by Moscow, refused to provide jobs to the journalists, in violation of French labour legislation. The management explained that not hiring any Ukrainian journalists was a specific instruction from VGTRK. 
 
 In October 2015, Euronews moved to a new global headquarters complex in La Confluence, Lyon, designed by Paris-based architecture firm Jakob + MacFarlane and covering a floor area of 10,000 m2 (21⁄2 acres). 
 The decision to move was announced prior to the majority takeover by Media Globe Networks. 
 
 In November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News, for a  " strategic partnership " . NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe. After successful negotiations with the European Commission, who feared that the partnership would result in an  " Americanization "  of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30 million. NBC News president Deborah Turness was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, who had led it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both reported directly to NBC News chairman Andrew Lack. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC. 
 
 In May 2017, Euronews went from having one TV channel with 13 audio tracks, to 10 separate TV channels and 12 websites. This is part of a ’''glocal''’ idea. Now, certain language editions can offer their own selections of local and global news. < ref > {{cite news|last=Dobbie|first=Anna|work=M & M Global|access-date=11 August 2020|date=11 May 2017|url=http://www.mandmglobal.com/euronews-reinvents-offering-in-bid-to-become-worlds-first-glocal-news-brand/|title=Euronews reinvents offering in bid to become world's first 'glocal' news brand|archive-date=9 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809084745/http://www.mandmglobal.com/euronews-reinvents-offering-in-bid-to-become-worlds-first-glocal-news-brand/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|work=The Drum|first=Ian|last=Burrell|date=11 May 2017|access-date=12 August 2020|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/05/11/euronews-overhauls-its-broadcasting-strategy-bid-become-the-unrivalled-chronicler|title=Euronews overhauls its broadcasting strategy in bid to become the unrivalled chronicler of Europe}} < /ref >  By doing this, the Arabic and Persian services stopped TV broadcasting, and they are now only on [[social media]] and the Euronews website. The Ukrainian service was closed because the Ukrainian government was not giving it money. < ref > {{cite news|work=Broadband TV News|access-date=12 August 2020|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/05/22/euronews-closes-ukrainian-service/|title=Euronews closes Ukrainian service|first=Chris|last=Dziadul|date=22 May 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2018, the English Euronews channel started its first news shows with live presenters. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.newscaststudio.com/2018/05/23/euronews-launches-good-morning-europe/|work=NewscastStudio|author=Michael P.

 On 20 April 2020, it was reported that NBCUniversal had sold its stake in Euronews to Media Globe Networks, eventually having an overall majority share of 88%. NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast had recently acquired pan-European satellite service Sky Group, and was prioritizing a collaboration between NBC News and Sky News on a new international news channel. The proposed service was scrapped in August during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, with the project no longer considered commercially viable. 
 
 In December 2021, reports surfaced that British-based BBC would buy an 88% controlling stake in Euronews.
