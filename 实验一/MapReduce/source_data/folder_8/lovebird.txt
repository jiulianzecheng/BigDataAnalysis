 A '''lovebird''' ('''''Agapornis''''') is a type of [[parrot]]. There are nine [[species]]. They are a social and affectionate small [[parrot]]. Seven species are native to [[Africa]], and the [[Grey-headed lovebird]] is native to [[Madagascar]].  
 
 Their common name comes from the parrots' strong, [[Monogamy|monogamous]] pair bonding and the long time the pairs spend sitting together. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grass and seeds. [[Black-winged lovebird]]s also eat [[insect]]s and [[fig]]s. [[Black-collared lovebird]]s have a special dietary requirement for native [[Fig|figs]]: this makes them more difficult to keep in captivity.
