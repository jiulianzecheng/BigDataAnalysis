 ==Biography== 
 At the end of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], Atropates was governor (''[[satrap]]'') of the Achaemenid province of [[Medes|Media]]. In the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (October [[331 BCE]]) between [[Darius III|Darius]] and Alexander, Atropates was in charge of the Achaemenid troops of [[Medes|Media]]. 
 
 When [[Darius III|Darius]] lost he went to the Median capital of [[Ecbatana]]. Atropates helped him. Darius tried to get a new army but could not.  He left Ecbatana in June [[330 BCE]]. After Darius' death a month later at the hands of [[Bessus]], < ref name= " Lendering "  / >  Atropates surrendered to Alexander. Alexander first chose Oxydates as satrap of [[Medes|Media]].  In 328-327 BCE Alexander did not trust in Oxydates' loyalty.  Atropates was made satrap again. In 325-324, Atropates gave Baryaxes (a rebel of the area) to Alexander. Alexander thought highly of Atropates. 
 
 Alexander died on June 10, [[323 BCE]]. Atropates' new son-in-law [[Perdiccas]] was named regent of Alexander's half-brother [[Philip III of Macedon|Philip III]]. After the  " [[Partition of Babylon]] "  in [[323 BCE]], [[Medes|Media]] was divided into two parts. The greater portion in the south-east was governed by [[Peithon]], a general of [[Perdiccas]]. The smaller portion in the north west was given to Atropates. At some point, Atropates made his part of Media an independent kingdom. His son-in-law [[Perdiccas]] was murdered by [[Peithon]] in the summer of [[320 BCE]]. 
 
 ==Legacy== 
 The dynasty Atropates made would rule the kingdom for several centuries. They became vassals of the [[Seleucids]], then as vassals of the [[Arsacids]]. 
 
 The area of Atropates' kingdom was known to the Greeks as  " [[Atropatene|Media Atropatene]] "  after Atropates.  Then as simply  " [[Atropatene]] " . The [[Arsacids]] called it 'Aturpatakan' in [[Parthian language|Parthian]], as did also the [[Sassanids]]. Eventually [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] 'Aturpatakan' became 'Azerbaijan'.  This is where the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] and the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian province of Azerbaijan]] get their name. < ref name= " dePlanhol " > {{citation|last=de Planhol|first=X.|chapter=Azerbaijan I: Geography|title=Encyclopædia Iranica|volume=3|year=1989|issue=1 |location=London|publisher=Routledge  &  Kegan Paul|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-i}} < /ref >
