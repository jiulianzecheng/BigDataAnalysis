'''Lonsdaleite''' is also known as hexagonal diamond because of its crystal structure, It is a [[allotrope]] of [[carbon]] with a Hexagonal lattice as compared to the cubical lattice of regular diamonds. 
 
 It is naturally found in meteorite debris of meteors that carried graphite and crashed onto earth, the great heat and pressure upon impact made the graphite turn into Lonsdaleite.
