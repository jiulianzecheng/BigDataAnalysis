 '''Diatoms''' are tiny [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[alga]]e. They are a common type of [[phytoplankton]]. Most are [[unicellular|single cells]], but some form chains or simple colonies.  
 
 Diatom cells have a unique cell wall made of [[silica]] (SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ). These walls (called  " frustules " ) take many forms, some quite beautiful and ornate. They usually have two asymmetrical sides with a split between them (hence  " diatom " ). 
 
 They are one of two great groups of single-celled organisms in the sea. The other is the [[Coccolith|coccoliths]]. Since diatoms are made of silica, and coccoliths are made of [[calcium carbonate]], they do not grow in the same places in the sea. This was first discovered by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]] in his voyage on ''HMS Rattlesnake'', 1846{{ndash}}1850. Diatoms are also found in some soils and in some waterways on land. 
 
 Living diatoms make about 20 to 50 percent of the [[oxygen]] produced on the planet each year. < ref > {{cite web| url = https://www.livescience.com/46250-teasing-apart-the-diatom-genome.html| title = The air you're breathing?

 Diatom [[chloroplast]]s were probably derived from those of [[red algae]]. The [[fossil]] record of diatoms starts in [[strata]] of the Lower [[Jurassic]], ~185 million years ago. [[Molecular clock]] [[evidence]] suggests an earlier date for their origin. < ref > Kooistra W.H.C.F. and Medlin L.K. 1996. Evolution of the diatoms (Bacillariophyta): IV.

 Diatoms have some practical uses. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring [[environment]]al conditions, past and present. They are commonly used in studies of water quality. They are also of interest to [[nanotechnology]].
