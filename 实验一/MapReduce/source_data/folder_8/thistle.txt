 '''Thistle''' is a group of [[flowering plant]]s which have sharp prickles on around the flower and are in the [[Asteraceae]] family. The prickles often all over the plant – on the stem and flat parts of leaves. This protects the plant against [[herbivorous]] animals, stopping them from eating the plant. 
 
 The term thistle is sometimes taken to mean exactly those plants in the group [[Cynareae]] (synonym: Cardueae), < ref > {{cite web | title = Cardueae ( " thistles " ) | work = BioImages: The Virtual Field-Guide (UK) | url = http://www.bioimages.org.uk/HTML/T1086.HTM | accessdate = 2007-11-30 | archive-date = 2007-10-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009051141/http://www.bioimages.org.uk/HTML/T1086.HTM | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  especially the genera ''[[Carduus]]'', ''[[Cirsium]]'', and ''[[Onopordum]]''. < ref name= " mw " > {{cite web | work = Merriam-Webster's online dictionary | title = thistle | url = http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary & va=thistle | accessdate = 2007-11-30}} < /ref >   However, plants outside this group are sometimes called thistles, and if this is done thistles would form a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group. 
 
 Thistle is the floral [[emblem]] of [[Scotland]].

 ==Heraldry== 
 [[File:Thistle Royal Badge of Scotland.svg|thumb|150px|right|Scottish thistle as a [[Heraldic badge]].]] 
 The thistle has been the national emblem of [[Scotland]] since the reign of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] (1249–1286) and was used on [[silver coin]]s issued by [[James III of Scotland|James III]] in 1470. It is the symbol of the [[Order of the Thistle]], a high [[chivalric order]] of [[Scotland]]. It is found in many [[Scottish symbols]] and as the name of several [[football in Scotland|Scottish football]] clubs. The thistle, crowned with the Scottish crown, is the symbol of seven of the eight Scottish Police Forces (the exception being the [[Northern Constabulary]]). The thistle is also the emblem of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] features the thistle in its crest. 
 
 ===Origin as a symbol of Scotland=== 
 According to a [[legend]], an invading [[Norsemen|Norse]] army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the [[Battle of Largs]], which marked the beginning of the departure of [[King]] [[Haakon IV]] (Haakon the Elder) of [[Norway]] who, having control of the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Hebrides]], had harried the coast of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] for some years. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/thistle/thistle.html |title=Scots History Online |access-date=2011-10-18 |archive-date=2011-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102164523/http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/thistle/thistle.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours Cotton Thistle ''[[Onopordum acanthium]]'', perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times; the Spear Thistle ''[[Cirsium vulgare]]'', an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. < ref > [http://www.twocrows.co.uk/kaleidescopes/text-pages/thistle-text.html Flowers of Scotland: Thistle] < /ref > < ref > [http://www.ormiston.com/ormiston/tartan/thistle.htm Why is the THISTLE a Scottish national symbol?] < /ref >  Other species, including Dwarf Thistle ''[[Cirsium acaule]]'', Musk Thistle ''[[Carduus nutans]]'', and Melancholy Thistle ''[[Cirsium heterophyllum]]'' have also been suggested. < ref > [http://www.visitscotland.com/guide/scotland-factfile/scottish-icons/the-thistle Scotland Fact File: The Thistle] < /ref > 
 
 ==Medical uses== 
 [[Maud Grieve]] recorded that [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and medieval writers had thought it could return hair to bald heads and that in the [[early modern period]] it had been believed to be a remedy for headaches, plague, canker, sores, vertigo, and jaundice. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/t/thistl11.html|title=A Modern Herbal|author=Maud Grieve|accessdate=2011-06-03}} < /ref >
