 A '''lyrebird''' is a ground-dwelling [[Australia]]n [[bird]]. < ref > They are called lyrebirds because, when up, their tail feathers form the shape of a [[lyre]], a [[Greece|Greek]] musical instrument. 
 < /ref >   There are two [[species]] in the [[genus]] '''''Menura'''''. They live in forests, especially [[rainforests]], of eastern [[Australia]], and they were introduced to [[Tasmania]] in the 19th century. They are found in two [[National Forest]] areas of [[Victoria]], < ref > Dandenong Ranges N.P. and Kingslake N.P. < /ref >  [[New South Wales]] and southeast [[Queensland]]. 
 
 == Mating system == 
 They are most notable for their superb ability to [[mimicry|mimic]] natural and artificial sounds from their environment. Since they live on the ground in fairly dense undergrowth, sound is used by the males to attract attention. When a female arrives, the visual display comes into action. It is a typical  " female choice "  mating system, where males defend a mating territory, and sing and display to get a mate. < ref name=Lill > Lill, Alan 2004. Family Menuridae (Lyrebirds).

 === Sound mimicry === 
 The lyrebird's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including other birds. It takes young birds about a year to perfect their mimicked [[repertoire]]. The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics, and will sing on occasion but the females do so with less skill than the males. < ref name=Lill/ >  A lyrebird classic is their imitation of human sounds in the forest such as car alarms, camera shutters and forest logging with chain-saws. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Hearing_%28sense%29#p004hgk8 |title=Attenborough, David ''The life of birds'' |access-date=2013-11-24 |archive-date=2013-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122181959/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Hearing_%28sense%29#p004hgk8 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > National Film and Sound Archive: [http://nfsa.gov.au/collection/sound/sounds-australia/complete-list/ Sounds of Australia] < /ref > 
 
 === Breeding ===

 The breeding cycle of the lyrebirds is long, and lyrebirds are long-lived birds. They can live up to thirty years. They also start breeding later in life than other [[passerine]] birds. Female [[Superb Lyrebird]]s start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight. Males defend territories from other males.These territories may contain the breeding places of up to eight females. In a male's territory, he makes or uses display platforms. < ref name = Lill/ > 
 
 The females each build an untidy nest, usually low to the ground in a moist gully, where each lays a single [[egg (biology)|egg]]. She is the sole parent who [[Avian incubation|incubates]] the egg over 50 days until it hatches, and she is also the sole carer of the lyrebird chick.
