 '''Poundland''' is a British [[chain store]] founded in 1990. When it started it sold most things at the single price of £1, including [[Clearance|clearance items]] and [[Brand|branded goods]]. The first pilot store opened in December 1990 following numerous rejections by landlords who were worried about a single-price store.  About 7 million customers shopped in Poundland every week in 2016.  They were mostly poorer  women. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Poundland profits as thrifty shoppers look after pennies|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/poundland-profits-as-thrifty-shoppers-look-after-pennies-1.1594928|access-date=2023-08-20|website=The Irish Times|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 They carried on using the slogan:  " Yes, Everything's £1! " , after they started selling items for more than £1 from the mid-2010s onwards. The [[Advertising Standards Authority]] received complaints that the slogan was  misleading and ordered them to stop. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Ed|date=2015-03-04|title=Poundland are in trouble for selling things that cost more than a pound|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/usvsth3m/poundland-trouble-selling-things-cost-5270303|access-date=2023-08-20|website=mirror|language=en}} < /ref >
