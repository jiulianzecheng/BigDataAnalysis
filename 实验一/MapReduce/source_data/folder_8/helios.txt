 '''Helios''' ({{lang-grc|Ἥλιος}}, ''Hēlios''; Ἠέλιος in [[Homeric Greek]]) is the god of the [[Sun]] in [[Greek mythology]]. He is often thought to be the [[personification]] of the Sun itself. He is the [[son]] of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Hyperion (titan)|Hyperion]] and [[Theia]]. He is the brother of [[Selene]], goddess of the Moon, and [[Eos]], goddess of the dawn. During the [[Hellenistic period]], particularly the 3rd Century BCE, he became more and more identified with [[Apollo]], the god of light, music and prophecy. Helios' equivalent in [[Roman mythology]] was [[Sol]].
