'''Bioleaching''' is getting [[metals]] from their [[ore]]s by using living [[organism]]s. This is much cleaner than the traditional method using [[cyanide]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/5 |title=Flotation technique cleaner than heap leaching |access-date=2012-01-25 |archive-date=2017-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127134612/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/5 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Bioleaching is one of several methods used to recover [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[cobalt]].  
 
 Bioleaching uses certain types of [[bacteria]] to produce a solution called a  " leachate " . By leaving these bacteria with a low-grade metal ore, they can produce leachates which have a compound of that metal. Because this is in a solution it can be used in [[electrolysis]] to make the pure metal. This only produces small amounts each time, and is repeated to make it economically viable.
