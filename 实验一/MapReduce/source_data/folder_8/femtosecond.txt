A '''femtosecond''' is one billionth of one millionth, or one quadrillionth of a [[second]]. It can be written as '''10 < sup > -15 < /sup >  second'''. Even shorter than this is an [[attosecond]]. 
 
 * 200 femtoseconds  -  the fastest [[chemical reaction]]s 
 * 300 femtoseconds  -  how long it takes for the atoms of an [[iodine]] [[molecule]] to vibrate
