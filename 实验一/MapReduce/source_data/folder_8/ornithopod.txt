 '''Ornithopoda''' is a clade of ornithischian dinosaurs, called '''ornithopods''', that started out as small, bipedal running grazers and grew in size and numbers until they became one of the most successful groups of herbivores in the Cretaceous world, dominating the North American land. 
 
 == Overview == 
 
 Their major evolutionary advantage was the progressive development of a chewing apparatus that became the most sophisticated ever developed by a non-avian dinosaur, rivaling that of modern mammals such as the domestic cow. 
 
 They reached their apex of diversity and ecological dominance in the hadrosaurids, before they were wiped out by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event along with all other non-avian dinosaurs. 
 
 Members are known from all seven continents, though they are generally rare in the Southern Hemisphere.

 They reached their apex in the [[hadrosaur|duck-bill]]s, before they were wiped out by the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]] with all other non-[[aves|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s. Members are known from all seven [[continent]]s, although the [[Antarctic]] remains are unnamed, and they are generally rare in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. They are the sister group to the horned dinosaurs ([[Ceratopsia]]) and the hard-headed dinosaurs ([[Pachycephalosauria]]). 
 
 ==Description== 
 Ornithopoda means  " bird feet " , from the [[Greek language|Greek]]. It refers to their three-[[toe]]d feet (though many early forms had four toes). They had no armour, a horny [[beak]], and various other features. Some ornithopods and [[cerapoda|cerapods]] had thin [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] plates along the outside of the ribs. In some cases, these plates mineralized and so were fossilized. The function of these plates is unknown. < ref name= " BG08 " > {{cite journal |last=Butler |first=Richard J. |author2=Galton, Peter M. |year=2008 |title=The 'dermal armour' of the ornithopod dinosaur ''Hypsilophodon'' from the Wealden (Early Cretaceous: Barremian) of the Isle of Wight: a reappraisal |journal=Cretaceous Research |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=636–642 |doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2008.02.002}} < /ref > < ref name= " CPN07 " > {{cite journal |last=Calvo |first=J.O. |author2=Porfiri, J.D. |author3= Novas, F.E.  |year=2007 |title=Discovery of a new ornithopod dinosaur from the Portezuelo Formation (Upper Cretaceous), Neuquén, Patagonia, Argentina. |journal=Arquivos do Museu Nacional |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=471–483 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Life-style and adaptations == 
 The ornithopods became one of the most successful groups of herbivores in the [[Cretaceous]] world, and dominated the landscape. They started out as small, [[bipedal]] running [[browser]]s, and grew in size and numbers. ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'' from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] of the [[Isle of Wight]], [[England]], is a typical example. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Weishampel D.B. and Heinrich R.E. | year = 1992| title =  Systematics of Hypsilophodontidae and basal Iguanodontia (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) |journal=Historical Biology| volume = 6| pages = 159–184 | doi = 10.1080/10292389209380426 | issue = 3 }} < /ref >  As they grew in size, they could move on four legs but still kept the habit of standing up on their hind legs when needed to reach food or perhaps to defend themselves or to run. 
 
 Their success is a perhaps surprising, as they had little obvious [[Defence against predators|defence]] against [[theropod]] [[carnivore]]s. They could run, and had the usual defences of a [[herd]] animal. < ref name= " Brett " > Brett-Surman M.K. 1997. ''The complete dinosaur''. (ed Farlow J.O  &  Brett-Surman M.K.)

They were very robust (heavy and strong), and armed with a dagger-like thumb. 
 [[File:Largestornithopods scale.png|thumb|left|Sizes of the largest ornithopods]] 
 
 The early ornithopods were only about 1 & nbsp;metre (3 & nbsp;feet) long, but probably very fast. They had a stiff tail, like the [[theropoda|theropods]], to help them balance as they ran on their hind legs. Later ornithopods became more adapted to grazing on all fours; their [[vertebral column|spine]]s curved, and came to resemble the spines of modern ground-feeders like the [[bison]]. As they became more adapted to eating while bent over, they became semi-[[quadruped]]al; still running on two legs, and comfortable reaching up into trees; but spending most of their time walking or grazing while on all fours. 
 
 Later ornithopods became larger, but never reached the huge size of the long-necked, long-tailed [[sauropod]]s which they largely replaced. The largest, like ''[[Shantungosaurus]]'', were as heavy as medium sized sauropods, but never grew much beyond 15 & nbsp;metres (50 & nbsp;feet).
