 '''Xanthophylls''' are types of [[yellow]] [[pigment]]s that can be seen in natural objects. They are found in the [[leaves]] of most green [[plants]]. They are difficult to see in a healthy leaf, because [[chlorophyll]] pigments make the leaf green. Unlike chlorophyll, however, xanthophylls do not need [[light]] for production. Therefore, leaves will only show the yellow pigments if the leaf does not get enough light ([[etiolation]]). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/xanthophylls.html|publisher=UCLA College of Life Sciences|title=General Botany: Leaf Color: Xanthophylls|access-date=2016-01-16|archive-date=2016-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190141/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/xanthophylls.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The name comes from the Greek words for  " yellow "  (''xanthos'', {{lang|el|ξανθός}}), < ref name=LSJ1 > {{LSJ|canqo/s|ξανθός|ref}} < /ref >  and  " leaf "  (''phyllon'', {{lang|el|φύλλον}}). < ref name=LSJ2 > {{LSJ|fu/llon|φύλλον|ref}} < /ref >
