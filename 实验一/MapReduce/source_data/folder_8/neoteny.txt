'''Neoteny''' is a type of [[heterochrony]]. It is a change in the timing of development in an animal. It is where bodily development is slowed, but sexual development goes on at the same rate. < ref > Abercrombie et al. 1992. (8th edition) ''Dictionary of Biology''. Penguin, London, p390. < /ref >  At the extreme, this results in a sexually mature juvenile or [[larva]]l form. A classic example of that is the [[Axolotl]] salamander. 
 
 It has often been suggested that the [[Homo sapiens|human species]] is an example of neoteny. There are features of adult humans that are more like those of juvenile [[Ape|apes]] than adult apes. < ref > ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution'', p90. eds Jones S; Martin R;  &  Pilbeam D. 1992. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-46786-1 < /ref >   
 
 These are some of the neotenous [[Trait (biology)|traits]] in humans:  
 #Flattened face, < ref name= " Montagu " > Montagu A. 1989. ''Growing young''. Bergin  &  Garvey: CT. < /ref >  broadened face, < ref name= " Ontogeny " > Gould S.J. 1977. ''Ontogeny and phylogeny''. Cambridge: Belknap Press. < /ref >  large brain, < ref name= " Montagu "  / >   
 #Hairless body, < ref name= " Montagu "  / >  hairless face, < ref name= " Jean " > Jean-Baptiste de Panafieu P. 2007. ''Evolution''. Seven Stories Press. < /ref >  small nose, < ref name= " Jean "  / >   
 #Reduction of brow ridge, < ref name= " Montagu "  / >  small teeth, < ref name= " Montagu "  / >  small upper jaw (maxilla), < ref name= " Montagu "  / >  small lower jaw (mandible), < ref name= " Montagu "  / >   
 #Thinness of skull bones, < ref name= " Ontogeny "  / >  limbs proportionately short compared to torso length, < ref name= " Ontogeny "  / >  longer leg than arm length, < ref > Maynard Smith J. 1958. ''The theory of evolution''. Cambridge University Press. < /ref >   
 #Larger eyes, < ref > {{cite web|url=https://zidbits.com/2011/06/why-do-men-find-women-with-larger-eyes-attractive/|title=Why do men find women with larger eyes attractive?|first=|last=Zidbits|website=Zidbits - Learn something new everyday!|access-date=2019-02-14|archive-date=2019-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402072228/https://zidbits.com/2011/06/why-do-men-find-women-with-larger-eyes-attractive/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 In some texts these differences may be called [[paedomorphosis]], meaning  " like a child " . The term  " K-selection "  is sometimes used to describe this evolutionary process. The process is all part of a situation where the species benefits from the longer-lasting of juvenile features into adult life. 
 
 If we continue the list into [[physiology]] and [[behaviour]], we find: 
 #Longer period of brain growth 
 #Longer period of learning 
 #Culture passed on through generations 
 #Mating deferred to older ages than apes 
 #Longer life 
 #Origin of articulate speech 
 #Larger social groups 
 
 This second list shows how the first list becomes the basis for the larger groups of modern man and their better transmission of experiences to later generations.
