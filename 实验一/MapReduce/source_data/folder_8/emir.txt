 '''Emir''' ({{lang-ar|أمير}}; female: '''{{lang|ar|أميرة}}'''; '''emira'''; ([[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]]: '''{{lang|fa|{{lang|ur|امیر}}}}''')  " commander "  or  " general " , also  " prince " ; also transliterated as '''amir''', '''aamir''' or '''ameer''') is a high [[Nobility|title of nobility]] or office. It is used throughout the [[Arab world]] and historically in some [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] states and Afghanistan. Emirs are usually considered high-ranking [[sheikh|sheiks]], but in monarchical states the term is also used for princes; then  " [[emirate]] "  means more or less the same as [[principality]] in this context. 
 Emir is used also as a name in [[Turkey]] like Emir Niego and Emir Sevinc.   
 ''Emir'' is the most common spelling in English and many other languages (for example, [[United Arab Emirates]]). The spelling ''amir'', that is closer to the original Arabic, is more common for its compounds (e.g., admiral) and in individual names.
