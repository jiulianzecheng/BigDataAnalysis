 '''Cobra''' is a name of a snake. In English it is the common name for various [[venomous snake]]s. Most of those species are in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Elapidae]], and most of them can spread their neck ribs to form a flattened, widened hood. 
 
 The name  " cobra "  is short for ''cobra de capelo'' or ''cobra-de-capelo'', which is Portuguese for  " snake with hood " , or  " hood-snake " . < ref name= " COED " > Oxford. 1991. ''The Compact Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-19-861258-3}}. < /ref > 
 
 Cobras usually live in tropical and desert regions of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. When feeling threatened, cobras can tilt back and flatten their heads into their warning posture. The rest of the time their heads are [[symmetrical]] and they look much like any other snakes. 
 
 '''Cobra''' may refer to: 
 * The [[genus]] '''''[[Naja]]''''', the typical or  " true "  cobras (they raise the front part of the body and flatten their neck in a [[Aposematism|warning signal]] when alarmed). They are a group of [[Elapidae|elapids]] found in Africa and Asia. They include over 270 species, including ''Naja nivea'', the [[Cape cobra]], a medium-sized, highly venomous cobra which lives in [[biomes]] across southern Africa; [[Cleopatra]]'s  " asp "  (the [[Egyptian cobra]], ''Naja haje''); and the Asiatic [[Indian cobra|spectacled cobra]] ''Naja naja''; and the [[monocled cobra]], ''[[Naja kaouthia]]''. 
 * [[Spitting cobra]]s, a subset of ''Naja'' species which squirt [[venom]] from their [[fang]]s in self-defence. 
 
 Most so-called, and all  " true " , species of cobras belong to the family Elapidae
