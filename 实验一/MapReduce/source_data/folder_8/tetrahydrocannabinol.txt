THC is a very [[Lipid|fatty]] chemical and doesn't interact with water very well. THC is thought to be used by the plant for protection from [[Insecticide|bugs]], [[light]], and other harm from its [[environment]]. The THC chemical structure was discovered in 1964 by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and Dr. Y. Gaoni at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://cannabinoids.huji.ac.il/people/raphael-mechoulam|title=Raphael Mechoulam Ph.D.|website=cannabinoids.huji.ac.il|language=en|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref >

 == Pharmacological Effects == 
 [[File:Bodily effects of cannabis.svg|thumb|How cannabis works in the body]] 
 Cannabis works by sticking to special [[Receptor (cell biology)|receptors]] in the [[brain]] and body, which is known as the endocannabinoid system or ECS. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Battista|first1=Natalia|last2=Di Tommaso|first2=Monia|last3=Bari|first3=Monica|last4=Maccarrone|first4=Mauro|date=2012-03-14|title=The endocannabinoid system: an overview|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=6|page=9|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00009|issn=1662-5153|pmc=3303140|pmid=22457644|doi-access=free}} < /ref >  There are 2 kinds of [[Cannabinoid receptor|receptors]], CB < sub > 1 < /sub >  and CB < sub > 2 < /sub > . Over time, a person will need more THC to feel the same effects as before. This is known as tolerance. A person may also experience [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], which can be uncomfortable and is a result of stopping THC use quickly after using it for some time. People usually do not get [[Drug addiction|addicted]] to using THC. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://teens.drugabuse.gov/blog/post/tolerance-dependence-addiction-whats-difference|title=Tolerance, Dependence, Addiction: What's the Difference?|website=NIDA for Teens|date=12 January 2017|language=en|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref > 
 
 == THC in the body == 
 THC is very [[fat]]ty (fat soluble) and binds to [[Adipose tissue|fat cells]] in our body and causes it to leave the body [[Metabolism|slowly]], even if the effects of the drug or high has already ended. The amount still in the body depends on how often THC is used. The minimum time for a person to pass a drug test would be about 1 week. It is not possible for [[human]]s or [[animal]]s to realistically [[Death|die]] from taking too much THC or marijuana and no person has ever died from it. 
 
 == Legality == 
 Many places in the world do not see THC or cannabis as [[Law|legal]] and can have very harsh [[Sentence (law)|penalties]] from having, [[Farming|producing]], or using it. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/41607|title=Legality of Cannabis by Country|last=ChartsBin|website=ChartsBin|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref >  Some countries allow it for use only in medical treatment while others allow it for recreational use by adults, usually older than 18 or 21 years old. Children may be permitted to use it if they're very sick. 
 
 In [[North America]], [[Canada]] < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health/campaigns/cannabis.html|title=Cannabis in Canada|last=Canada|first=Health|date=2018-02-26|website=aem|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref >  and [[Mexico]] < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://marketrealist.com/2020/01/mexico-will-attempt-legalize-marijuana-2020/|title=Mexico Will Attempt to Legalize Marijuana in 2020|date=2020-01-24|website=Market Realist|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref >  have taken action to allow marijuana use in some way. In the [[United States]], the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] sees marijuana as [[Illegal drugs|illegal]] and very addictive and cannot be used as a medicine. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/marijuana|title=Marijuana|website=www.dea.gov|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref >  Individual states with in the [[U.S.A.]] allows people to use marijuana to help with sickness or recreationally. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state|title=Map of Marijuana Legality by State|last=Solutions|first=DISA Global|date=2019-04-01|website=DISA Global Solutions|language=en|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/marijuana.html|title=Marijuana|website=www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref > 
 
 == Drug Testing == 
 [[Employer]]s or people who work in a [[government]] agency, like the [[police]] or [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], may [[test]] someone to see if they used any drugs recently. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.fbijobs.gov/working-at-FBI/eligibility|title=Eligibility {{!}} FBIJOBS|website=www.fbijobs.gov|access-date=2020-06-24}} < /ref >  This is called a [[Cannabis drug testing|drug test]]. Police may do this if they think you have used marijuana before or while you are [[Driving under the influence|driving]] a [[car]]. THC lasts a long time in the body and can be found in body fluids, like [[urine]] or [[saliva]], or [[hair]] and [[sweat]]. Since it lasts so long in the body, it can be a problem being sure if someone is high.
