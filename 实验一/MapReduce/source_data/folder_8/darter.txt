 The '''darters''', '''anhingas''', or '''snakebirds''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of aquatic birds which resemble [[pelican]]s. They mainly occur in the [[tropics]].  
 
 There are four living [[species]]. Three of the species are common, the fourth is rarer, and listed as [[Near-threatened species|near-threatened]] by the [[IUCN]].  
 
 The term ''snakebird'' is used for any of these species: They have a long thin [[Neck (body part)|neck]]. When they swim, only the head and neck are visible. This looks like a [[snake]]. ''Darter'' is a term that refers to they way these birds catch fish: They [[Impalement|impale]] the fish with their [[beak]]. The American darter is sometimes called ''anhinga''. Sometimes it is called '''water turkey''', even though it is unrelated to the [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]].
