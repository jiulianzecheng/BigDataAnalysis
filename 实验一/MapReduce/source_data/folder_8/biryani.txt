 The cooking method of Biryani came from [[Iran]]. It was brought to the [[Indian subcontinent]] by [[Iran]]ian travelers and merchants. In [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], the recipe of biryani developed to its current form. Local variants of this dish are popular not only in [[South Asia]] but also in [[Bangladesh]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Arabia]], and within various South Asian communities in Western countries.
