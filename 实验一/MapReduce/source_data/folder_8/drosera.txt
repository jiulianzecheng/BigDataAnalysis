 '''''Drosera''''', sometimes called '''Sundews''', are [[carnivorous plant]]s. They use a thick [[glue]]y goo called ''mucilage'' to trap and [[digestion|digest]] their [[prey]].The mucilage is attached to special hairs called [[trichome]]s. They are one of the most common [[carnivorous plant]]s. They have at least 188 [[species]]. < ref > McPherson S.R. 2008. ''Glistening carnivores''.

 == Description == 
 Its scientific name is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δρόσος:  " drosos "  =  " dew, dewdrops " . Its English name is ''sundew'', from [[Latin]] ''ros solis'', meaning  " dew of the sun " . Both names describe the sweet-smelling, sticky [[mucilage]] (goo) that comes down the ends of [[Tentacle|tentacles]] on each flower [[stem|stalk]]. < ref name=Slack/ >  This mucilage rolls down the plant, attracting [[sugar]]-loving insects day and night. < ref name=Slack/ >  The mucilage has [[enzyme]]s which [[digestion|digests]] them so that the plants can get the [[nitrogen]] it needs from it. Like all [[plant]]s, the sundew makes its own food, and just uses insects for nitrogen and other [[nutrient]]s. These tiny flowering plants are about {{convert|5|in|mm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} tall, < ref name=Slack/ >  about as tall as an adult's [[hand]], though some climbing sundews can be much taller. One species of sundew, the ''Drosera erythrogyne'', grew up to {{convert|30|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.cephalotus.net/article.aspx?cid=12 & y=2001 & m=10 & d=22 |title=World's Largest ''Drosera'' |last=Mann |first=Phil |website=Carnivorous Plants of Western Australia |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075055/http://www.cephalotus.net/article.aspx?cid=12 & y=2001 & m=10 & d=22 |archive-date=29 September 2011 |access-date=27 January 2010 }} < /ref >  Sundew roots are not very strong. They are usually simply for taking in [[water]] and keeping the sundew firmly planted to the ground. 
 
 == What they eat == 
 [[File:Drosera anglica ne2.jpg|thumb|left|Sundews eating [[Damselfly|Damselflies]].]] 
 A [[fly]], [[butterfly]], or other [[nectar]]-loving [[insect]] will find the sweet smell of the mucilage that oozes from the plant. Landing on the colorful tip, the insect will immediately be stuck. < ref name=Slack/ >  The plant has cells that make more mucilage in the place where the insect is. The gooey mucilage will completely [[wikt:surround|surround]] the insect. Then, the sundew plant [[wikt:wrap|wraps]] its outside tentacles around the insect, [[wikt:absorb|absorbing]] its nutrients. It curls its tentacles around the insect quite quickly: in some species this takes only a few seconds. Some species, like ''Drosera glanduligera'' can curl its tentacles towards its prey in less than a second. < ref > Hartmeyer I.  &  S. 2005. ''Drosera glanduligera'': Der Sonnentau mit  " Schnapp-Tentakeln " , DAS TAUBLATT (GFP): 34-38 < /ref >  Many sundews can bend parts of themselves so that the prey will be as sticky as possible. One species, ''Drosera capensis'', actually wraps its leaf around the prey in 30 minutes, as seen in the picture on the right. The prey usually [[wikt:die|dies]] in about 15 minutes. < ref > {{cite book| author=Charles Darwin| title=Insectivorous Plants| publisher=| location=| year=1875| url=http://isis.library.adelaide.edu.au/pg/etext04/insec10.txt| access-date=2010-01-27| archive-date=2005-07-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720054723/http://isis.library.adelaide.edu.au/pg/etext04/insec10.txt| url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The sundew will then eat the entire insect except the outside exoskeleton. When the plant has finished eating, it opens up its tentacles and drops the exoskeleton to the ground. < ref name=Slack/ > 
 
 == Other uses == 
 Sundews have also been used in [[herb]]al [[medicine]] for a long time. Today they are still used to stop [[cough]]s, [[asthma]], and [[lung]] [[wikt:infection|infections]]. 
 
 Because they are carnivorous (eat living things), and because of the [[beauty]] of the dew-like mucilage on their tentacles, sundews are also popular as [[wikt:ornament|ornamental plants]]. However, they can be quite hard to grow: they need lots of [[water]] (their [[soil]] usually has to keep on being very wet), and this water has to be pure (without [[mineral]]s inside it), because this can stop them from growing or even kill them. 
 
 Parts of sundews were also eaten by [[Australian Aborigine]]s. < ref > Barthlott ''et al.'', ''Karnivoren'', p. 100 < /ref >
