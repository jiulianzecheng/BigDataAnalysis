 The '''Folketing''' ({{lang-da|Folketinget}}) is the [[nation]]al [[parliament]] of [[Denmark]]. The name means  " People's thing "  (a ''thing'' in this case is a [[government|governing assembly]]). It is the highest [[Legislature|legislative body]] in the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] and decides most of the [[law]]s for [[Denmark]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. The Folketing meets in [[Christiansborg Palace]], in the Danish [[Capital (city)|capital]], [[Copenhagen]]. 179 members sit in the Folketing (175 from Denmark, 2 from Greenland and 2 from the Faroe Islands) and are [[democracy|democratically]] [[election|elected]]. 
 
 Greenland and the Faroe Islands also have their own, less powerful, parliaments and are allowed to make some laws on their own. 
 
 The Folketing is where many [[political parties]] in Denmark meet to discuss important issues affecting Danish people, and to pass laws they agree on. The Folketing is also where the [[Denmark#Government and politics|Government of Denmark]] is formed, when several parties who are in agreement decide to join together and form a [[coalition]] [[government]] (the parties forming a government must have over half of the total members of the Folketing; a majority). The [[voting system]] used in Denmark is [[proportion]]al, meaning the [[distribution]] of seats reflects the distribution of votes. This means that many parties and different [[politics|political views]] are represented, including some [[Extremism|extreme views]]. 
 
 The leader of the Folketing is the ''Speaker'' who sits at the front. The members sit in front of the speaker in the shape of a [[semicircle]]. 
 
 From 1849 to 1953, the Folketing was one of the two houses in a parliament. It was known as the  " Rigsdag " . The other house was known as the  " Landsting " . The members of the Folketing included [[farmer]]s, [[trade]]rs and [[merchant]]s. The Landsting was made up of the rich members of [[society]]. It included the [[nobility]]. These members were chosen by the [[King of Denmark|King]] to become members. In 1953 the Landsting was gotten rid of. This left the Folketing as the only house of parliament. The Rigsdag became the Folketing.
