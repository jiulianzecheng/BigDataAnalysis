 == Behaviour changes == 
 After the larvae of ''Glyptapanteles'' emerge, the caterpillar takes up position near the cocoons of the pupae, arches its back, and ceases to move or feed. It will occasionally spin silk over the pupae. However, when disturbed, it begins to thrash violently. This behavior is to strike at and repel possible predators of the pupae, so improving the survival odds of the wasp pupae. Only about one in twenty non-parasitized caterpillars responded in this fashion. In 60% of cases, the parasitized caterpillars successfully warded off these potential predators. No longer eating, the affected caterpillar eventually dies. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/06/parasitic_wasp_turns_caterpillars_into_headbanging_bodyguard.php?|title=Parasitic wasp turns caterpillars into head-banging bodyguards|last=Yong|first=Ed|date=2008|publisher=Not Exactly Rocket Science|accessdate=2008-07-04|archive-date=2008-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606235637/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/06/parasitic_wasp_turns_caterpillars_into_headbanging_bodyguard.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 ===Mechanism=== 
 In the course of Grosman's research, it was discovered that not all larval ''Glyptapanteles'' emerge from their caterpillar host. One or two remain behind and active. Probably these larvae manipulate the host. It is a kind of [[altruism]], since these larvae miss their own chance of pupating in order to protect the brood. < ref name= " UvA Press Office " > {{cite news|url=http://www.science.uva.nl/news/news.cfm/52F68A38-1321-B0BE-A4BAC4DA2626953B|title=Parasitoid turns host into bodyguard|date= 2008|publisher=Universiteit von Amsterdam Faculty of Science News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211101252/http://www.science.uva.nl/news/news.cfm/52F68A38-1321-B0BE-A4BAC4DA2626953B|accessdate=2008-07-04|archive-date=2012-02-11}} < /ref >
