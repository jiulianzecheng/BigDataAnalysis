 The '''pineapple''' is a [[fruit]]. It is native to [[South America]], [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. The word  " pineapple "  came from European explorers, who thought the fruit looked similar to a [[Conifer cone|pine cone]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/pineapple|title=Pineapple|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press|date=2015|accessdate=2015-08-19|archive-date=2015-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921130014/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/pineapple|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The pineapple is a [[tropical]] plant and it must not be kept under 10 degrees. It takes a long time for the pineapple to grow. It mainly depends on the location and the growing conditions it gets. If the [[temperature]] is warm, the pineapple will grow faster. On average, it takes about two to three [[years]] to grow. < ref > [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080514210738AA9aw1P  " How Long Does it Take to Grow a Full Sized Pineapple? " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428023113/https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080514210738AA9aw1P |date=2021-04-28 }}, answers.yahoo. < /ref >  If the fruit travels by boat, the fruit must be picked before ripening, since the trip takes a long time. Sometimes, pineapple has to travel by boat to be accessible to all. It is different for air travel. The pineapple can be picked when it is grown, since travel time is short. In most countries, pineapples are called ''ananas''.

 == Symbolism == 
 
 Early Europeans commonly called any kind of fruit an  " apple " . The [[Spain|Spanish]] thought pineapples looked like pine cones. Pineapples have nothing to do with pine cones and apples, but because of the similar shape between the pineapple and the pine cone, most people change it into [[symbolism]]. Both have been used for symbolizing [[fertility]]. The pineapple symbolized [[friend]]ship and hospitality to the Caribs. These people usually hung pineapples outside their [[wikt:hut|huts]] to show their welcome. < ref > Nectar and Ambrosia: An Encyclopedia of Food in World Mythology, Tamra Andrews ABC-CLIO:Santa Barbara CA 2000 (p. 177,179) < /ref >
