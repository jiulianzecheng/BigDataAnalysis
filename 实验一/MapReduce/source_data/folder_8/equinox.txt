 An '''equinox''' is when the [[sun]] passes directly over the [[equator]]. There are two equinoxes each [[year]].  Equinox can also mean either of the two days when this happens. On these days, the [[wikt:night|nights]] are equal in [[length]] at latitudes L° North and L° South. The word ''equinox'' comes from two [[Latin language|Latin]] words meaning  " equal "  and  " night " .  
 
 Around the day of the equinox, the length of the day is a little over twelve hours and the length of the night is a little under twelve hours. They are not exactly equal because the sun is not a point in the sky and because the sunlight bends as it comes to earth. The exact day and time when this happens depend on how far away from the [[equator]] it is being measured. They occur on or around [[March 21]] and [[September 21]]. Solstices fall around June 21st and December 21st at odd intervals. 
 
 The equinoxes are the beginning of [[spring]], and [[autumn]] (or ''fall'' in the [[United States|US]]). 
 
 The time of daylight is quite easy to measure. This was done in many cultures where [[festival]]s were celebrated at the equinoxes.
