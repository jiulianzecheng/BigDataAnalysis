 The first four of these reactions have been known for a long time, since [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. Finding them is attributed to [[Celsus]]. The last one was added by [[Rudolf Virchow]] in [[1858]]. 
 
 There are two types of inflammation: acute and chronic. Acute inflammations are more intense but short-lived, while chronic inflammations are less intense but long-lived. Examples of acute inflammation include skin disorders (e.g., [[psoriasis]], dandruff) and [[arthritis]], while chronic inflammation can be responsible for diseases such as [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], [[type 2 diabetes]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Adoption of [[healthy diet]], [[physical exercise]] and rest are some of the ways to reduce Inflammations. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Inflammation|url=https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation|access-date=2021-09-21|website=WebMD|language=en}} < /ref >
