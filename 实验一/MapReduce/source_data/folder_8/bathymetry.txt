 '''Bathymetry''' is the study of the [[underwater]] [[terrain]] of [[lake]]s or [[ocean floor]]s. It is the same as [[topography]], except that it looks at the underwater topography. It is a field of [[oceanography]]. The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|βαθύς}} (''bathus''), meaning  " deep " , < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbaqu%2Fs βαθύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus < /ref >  and {{lang|el|μέτρον}} (''metron''), meaning  " measure " . < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Ftron μέτρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus < /ref >  Bathymetric (or [[Hydrography|hydrographic]]) charts are often made to support the [[safety]] of underwater [[navigation]] and [[exploration]]. Most of these underwater [[topographic map]]s use [[contour line]]s (called ''depth contours'' or ''isobaths'') to show the terrain of the [[sea floor]], and how deep it is. They usually also give surface navigational information. 
 
 Originally, bathymetry involved the measurement of ocean [[depth]] through [[depth sounding|sounding]]. Early techniques used heavy [[rope]] or cable lowered over a ship's side. This method measures the depth of the water at a single location each time. It was not a very accurate method. The data used to make bathymetric maps today usually comes from an echosounder ([[sonar]]). This device is attached to the bottom or the side of a boat. < ref name='Olsen' > {{citation
