 ==Production== 
 Dentures can be made of different materials, such as acrylic, nylon or metal. Depending on the teeth they replace there are different designs. 
 ==How they work== 
 Properly fitted dentures help with speech, eating. They may also boost self-confidence. They can also help to prevent the face from sagging over time and may offer protection to the remaining teeth. 
 
 == Types == 
 There are many types of false teeth available. They include partial dentures and full dentures. 
 
 All need fitting so that they match your teeth’s shape, size, and color. The fitting can be done by a specialist called a prosthodontist or by a general dentist, many of whom also fit dentures.
