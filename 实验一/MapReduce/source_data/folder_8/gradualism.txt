'''Gradualism''' is a [[process]] of change by gradual, slow stages. In [[politics]], it is the opposite of [[revolution]]s and rapid change.  " Gradualism is... sometimes associated with [[social democracy]]. " < ref > Scruton, Roger 1982. ''A dictionary of political thought''. Macmillan < /ref > 
 
 In [[geology]], it is in tune with [[uniformitarianism]] and against [[catastrophism]]. In [[evolution|biology]] it is in tune with [[Darwinian]] ideas of slowly changing [[species]] as opposed to large rapid changes 
 
 ==Politics and society==  
 Gradualism is one of the defining features of political [[liberalism]] and [[reformism]]. It is against abrupt strokes such as [[revolution]]s or [[rebellion|uprisings]]. Instead, change ought to be brought about in small [[wikt:discrete|discrete]] steps. 
 
 [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]., was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating [[racial segregation]]. The government wanted to try to integrate [[African-American]]s and [[European Americans|European-Americans]] slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

 Charles Lindblom was an influential professor and author who believed in muddling through ( " incrementalism " ) as the right way to go. He pointed out the connexions between the political system, the market-place and democratic freedom. < ref > Charles Lindblom 1959. The science of 'muddling through'.

 ==Geology and biology== 
 In the natural sciences, gradualism is a [[theory]] that profound change is the product of slow but continuous processes. It is often contrasted with [[catastrophism]]. Gradualism was proposed in 1795 by [[James Hutton]] to explain [[geology]], and was later was the basis for [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology''. [[William Whewell]] called the idea '[[uniformitarianism]]'. It formed the basis of early [[evolution]]ary theory. 
 
 [[Charles Darwin]] was influenced by Lyell's ''Principles of Geology''. Everything we see from the past is explained by processes we can see going on today. The present is key to the past. So Darwin thought evolutionary must occur gradually, not in jumps ('saltations'), since we do not see big changes going on today. Extreme and rapid changes in an organism would be most likely to be fatal. It is almost universally agreed that complex organs such as the eye must have [[Evolution of the eye|evolved]] by many small steps rather than by one or two [[mutation]]s. < ref > 'Gradualism' in Bullock, Alan ''et al'' 1988.

 " Phyletic gradualism "  is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and Niles Eldredge to contrast with their model of punctuated equilibrium. They proposed that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary [[stability]] or stasis, punctuated by rare instances of [[species splitting|branching evolution]]. < ref name=punc1972 > Eldredge, Niles and S.J. Gould 1972. [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism.] In T.J.M. Schopf (ed) ''Models in paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper, 82-115 < /ref >  Their idea is less accepted today.
