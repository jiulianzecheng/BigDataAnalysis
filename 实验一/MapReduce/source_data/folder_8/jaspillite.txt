 '''Jaspillite''', or ''jaspilite'', is a chemical rock formed similar to [[chert]]. It is usually [[iron]] rich. It also has the name ''jasper [[taconite]]''.  
 
 Jaspillite is typically a layered mixture of [[hematite]] and [[quartz]]. It is common in the [[banded iron formation]] rocks of [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean|Archaean]] age in the Canadian shield of [[North America]]. 
 
 Jaspillite is also a [[sedimentary rock]].in certain [[lead]]-[[zinc]] [[ore]] deposits. 
 
 It is used as a gemstone. < ref > Gemstones of North America - Volume 1, John Sinkankas - 1959 p.345 < /ref >
