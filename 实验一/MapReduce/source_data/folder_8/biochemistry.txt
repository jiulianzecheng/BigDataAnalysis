'''Biochemistry''' is the study of [[chemical reaction]]s in living beings, and of biological molecules in general. It is important to [[cell biology]] and [[physiology]]. The study of biochemistry involves [[enzyme]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[sugar]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[lipid]]s. In the body, most of the molecules are [[polymer]]s built of long chains of smaller molecules. Biochemistry studies the chemical transformations which produce these small building-block molecules, and which produce energy from food. A person who studies biochemistry is called a biochemist. 
 ==Macromolecules== 
 The biologic polymers can have between tens of thousands to tens of millions of atoms or more. These polymers are composed of many small molecules, each of which has no more than fifty atoms. These small molecules are made almost exclusively from [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]]. They also contain [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], and a few other atoms, which are critical to the biological functioning of these polymers. 
 
 There are four types of [[macromolecule]]s. 
 
 ===Nucleic Acids===

 [[Nucleic acid]]s are long-chain [[molecules]] which are of two kinds: [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Their building blocks are called [[nucleotide]]s. 
 
 [[DNA]] is found in every cell. It contains the information needed to make all of the nucleic acids and all of the [[protein]]s. It is found joined up in a ''double helix''. It is the substance of [[heredity]], and holds the information which life passes from generation to generation. 
 
 [[RNA]] acts to make the information from DNA work inside the [[cell]]s of the body. To make a particular protein the information in the DNA is transferred to an RNA molecule. Another RNA molecule uses this as a set of instructions for making the protein. The RNA which makes protein is called a [[ribosome]] and it acts as a [[ribozyme]] vastly increasing the speed with which the individual [[amino acid]]s connect together to form the protein. 
 
 ===Proteins===

 [[Proteins]] are polymers of [[amino acid]]s. There are twenty different common types of [[amino acid]]. 
 
 Broadly speaking, proteins have two kinds of functions. The first is structural: they make up many of the key structures in cells and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. [[Muscle]], [[hair]], and [[skin]] are all mainly made of protein. The second is functional: as [[enzyme]]s they greatly speed up the chemical reactions in a living cell. All cellular life consists of a thousand, or more, chemical reactions, called [[metabolism]], which transform the molecules eaten into energy, or into other molecules the cell needs to survive. The function of proteins is to speed up these reactions, often by over a million times faster. In addition, they cause chemical reactions to occur which would not be without the action of the protein. 
 
 ===Carbohydrates=== 
 [[Carbohydrates]] include [[sugar]]s and [[starch]]es. 
 
 Sugars are the simplest carbohydrates. The [[monosaccharide]]s are  " single sugars " , such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. The disaccharides are two monosaccharides joined. Table [[sucrose|sugar (cane sugar)]] is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. The [[polysaccharide]]s are made from many monosaccharids joined. The vast majority of polysaccharides are polymers of glucose, and are of two types: [[starch]] and [[cellulose]]. Starch is the white stuff of [[grain]], [[potatoes]], [[apples]], and [[bread]], and is a readily available source of energy for the body. [[Cellulose]] is the structural material that holds up all plants. Half of the material that makes wood is cellulose. 
 
 Carbohydrates have a number of functions in the body, but the most important is to act as a ready source of energy for the cell's [[metabolism]]. By breaking the [[chemical bond]]s in carbohydrates, energy is released and can be used by the body. 
 
 ===Lipids=== 
 [[Lipid]]s are [[fat]]s, and [[wax]]es. Saturated lipids contain single [[chemical bond|bonds]], and are found in [[butter]] and [[lard]]. Unsaturated lipids have one or more double bonds and are often found in oils. The [[human body]] stores lipids as an energy source. When the body needs a large amount of energy, lipid molecules are broken down to release that energy.
