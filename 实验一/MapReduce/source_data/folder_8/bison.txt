 '''Bisons''' are large, [[even-toed ungulate]]s.  They are [[bovine]]s, and are similar to [[cow]]s. They are often called buffalo, but are not closely related to the [[African buffalo]] or [[water buffalo]].   
 
 Bison live in the northern part of the world. The American bison lives in [[North America]] where they once wandered around the [[prairie]]s in huge [[herd]]s. The wisent lives in [[Europe]]. Bison can also live in rugged areas.

 == European == 
 European bison ([[wisent]]) tend to live in lightly wooded to fully wooded areas and areas with increased [[shrubs]] and [[shrub|bush]]es, though they can also live on [[Grassland|grasslands]] and plains. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 They are classified in the subfamily [[Bovinae]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Bovidae]]. 
 * Genus ''Bison'' 
 ** [[American bison]] (''Bison bison'') 
 ** [[Wisent]] or [[European bison]] (''Bison bonasus'') 
 
 == Life == 
 They live to be about 20 years old and are born without their  " hump "  or horns, which both males and females have. After shedding their lightly colored hair, and with their horns, they are grown at 2 to 3 years of age, but males keep growing slowly until seven years. Adult bulls are very dominant in mating season. Adult bison usually have one or two baby bison.
