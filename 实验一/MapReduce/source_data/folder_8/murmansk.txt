 == History == 
 
 The first Murmansk settlement was founded in 1915. It was founded during [[World War I]] so Russia's [[Triple Entente|allies]] could send supplies to a port that wasn't blocked by ice as [[Arkhangelsk|Archangelsk]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] were. < ref name= " ATSBook24 " > ''Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast'', p. & nbsp;24 < /ref >  The location soon had a naval base and port. The settlement became an official city in 1916, and was named '''Romanov-on-Murman''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Рома́нов-на-Му́рмане, Romanov-na-Murmane). The city was given it's current name on 16 April 1917. < ref name= " ATSBook60 " > ''Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast'', pp. & nbsp;60–63 < /ref > 
 
 From 1918 to 1920, during the [[Russian Civil War]], the city was occupied by the [[White movement|White army]] and the [[Triple Entente]]. 
 
 During [[World War II]], the city was an important link to the Western world for the [[Soviet Union]]. They traded supplies during the war.

The Soviets defeated the invaders, but Murmansk suffered a lot of destruction. < ref > [http://www.b-port.com/info/smi/vm/?issue=538 & article=10256 Газета «Вечерний Мурманск» Выпуск № 93 от 28 мая 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620125619/http://www.b-port.com/info/smi/vm/?issue=538 & article=10256 |date=2016-06-20 }} {{in lang|ru}} < /ref >
