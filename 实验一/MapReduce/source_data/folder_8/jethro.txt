[[Jethro]] is a person in the [[Book of Exodus]] who is also called Reuel. He lived in [[Midian]] and was a [[Priest]] there. Since he had no sons, he sent his daughters to get [[water]] for his [[sheep]]. But [[male]] [[Shepherd|shepherds]] stopped them by the [[Well]] so [[Moses]] came and helped the girls by making the men go away. When Jethro’s daughters came back to him, Jethro told them to bring Moses home to him and they did. Jethro hired Moses to be his [[shepherd]] and Moses married Jethro’s daughter [[Zipporah|Tzippora]] and had two sons [[Gershom]] and Eliezer. When [[Hashem]] appeared to Moses and told him to lead the [[Hebrews]] out of [[Egypt]], Jethro told Moses “go to [[Peace]]”. Jethro later met Moses again in the desert and told him not to be the only [[Judge]] but to appoint other judges since Moses couldn’t do everything on his own. Moses listened to Jethro’s advice.
