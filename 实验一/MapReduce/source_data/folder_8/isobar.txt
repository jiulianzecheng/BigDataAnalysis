 In [[meteorology]], an '''isobar''' is a line on a [[map]] that connects areas with the same [[atmospheric pressure]]. [[Wind]] is generally [[perpendicular]] to isobars. When looking at the difference in pressure, it is also possible to estimate wind direction and speed. The first person to use isobars was [[Alexander Buchan]] (1829-1907).
