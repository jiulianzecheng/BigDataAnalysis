 The Vikings were [[Scandinavia|Scandinavi]][[Scandinavia|an]] people from Northern [[Europe]] who were known as great seamen and [[warrior]] < nowiki/ > s. From the 8th to the 11th centuries they travelled to Europe in their [[longship|long ship]]s, attacking and then settling in areas that are now [[British Isles|modern Great Britain]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]]. < ref > Colin Hynson, ''How People Lived in Viking Times'' (New York: Rosen Group Publishing, Inc., 2009), p. 6 < /ref > 
 == Background == 
 The people of the far [[north]], later called Vikings, were first noticed by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] around the year 100 [[BC]].{{efn|The Romans of the time believed the Baltic sea was a part of the ocean and lands north of the Baltic were [[island]]s. < ref > James Oliver Thomson, ''History of Ancient Geography'' (New York: Bilbo  &  Tannen, 1965), p. 241 < /ref >  Early writers mentioned an island called [[Thule]]. < ref > Barry Cunliffe, The Extraordinary Voyage of Pytheas the Greek: The Man Who Discovered Britain'' (New York: Walker  &  Company, 2002), p. 126 < /ref >  It lay beyond the known world of the time but it is thought now to be [[Norway]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/thule#m_en_gb0862120 |title=Thule |author= |website= |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=8 December 2015 |archive-date=9 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009110943/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Thule#m_en_gb0862120 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They did not come into contact with Germanic tribes north of the [[Danube]] until the [[1st century]] [[AD]]. About 98 AD, [[Tacitus]] wrote ''Germania'' which was an account of the German peoples. < ref > Graeme Davis, ''Thor: The Viking God of Thunder'' (Long Island City, NY: Osprey Publishing, 2013), p. 60 < /ref > .}} < ref name=Chartrand10.11 > René Chartrand; et al., ''The Vikings: Voyagers of Discovery and Plunder'' (Oxford: Osprey, 2006), pp. 10–11 < /ref >  This is when the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutons]] moved into [[south]]ern [[Gaul]]. < ref name=Chartrand10.11/ >  The Romans believed these [[war]]-like tribes came from [[Jutland]]. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater [[threat]] located further north. < ref name=Chartrand10.11/ >  The Roman historians [[Jordanes]] described the [[wikt:destructive|destructive]] [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]] as having come from [[Gotland]]. < ref name=Chartrand10.11/ >  The northern menace survived the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. 
 
 The [[Franks#Frankish_Empire|Frankish Empire]] that came after them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat. < ref name=Chartrand10.11/ >  As the later [[Carolingian Empire]] expanded into northern [[Germany]] they came into contact with the [[Danish people]]. This is when the Vikings first entered into [[writing|written]] [[history]]. < ref name=Chartrand10.11/ >  The first recorded raid in the [[west]] was at [[Lindisfarne]] in 793. < ref > Bonnie G Smith; Richard Von Glahn; Kris E Lane; et al, ''Crossroads and Cultures'', Volume B: 500-1750 (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2012), p. 298 < /ref >  Why the Vikings suddenly began raiding is not completely clear. But a popular [[theory]] is the [[population]]s had grown to the point there was not enough [[food]] to feed everyone. < ref name=Claster138.0 > Jill N.

They turned to [[looting]], then returning home. These hit-and-run raids were made possible because the Vikings were master boat builders and they created flat bottomed boats ideal for journeys up [[river]] < nowiki/ > s, where many monastic sites lay, ready for plundering.  < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings|year=1997|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00sawy|last=Sawyer|first=P.H.

 Three different groups of Vikings can be identified. They took three different, sometimes [[wikt:overlap|overlap]]ping, routes. < ref name=Claster138.0/ > 
 * '''[[Danes]]''' raided England, Gaul, and followed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[Europe]] south into the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to Italy. < ref name=Claster138.0/ > 
 * '''[[Sweden|Swedes]]''' went eastward into the [[Baltic Sea]]. They followed the [[Volga river|Volga]] and [[Dnieper River]]s south as far as the [[Black Sea]]. One group, called the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], founded the settlement of [[Kiev]]. They called it Russland (later known as [[Russia]]). < ref name=Claster138.0/ > 
 *'''[[Norway|Norwegians]]''' raided England but preferred Ireland and [[Scotland]]. They also traveled to [[Greenland]] and about the year 1,000 [[AD]] landed at a place they called Vinland ([[North America]]). < ref name=Claster138.0/ >   
   
 === Vikings in Europe === 
  [[File:Viking helmet.jpg|thumb|left|100px|{{Center|A [[helmet]] that the Vikings wore}}]] 
 Europeans were scared of the Vikings because of their strong [[weapon]]s, swift [[attack]]s, and cruel fighting tactics. They were known for their bad treatment of [[Woman|women]], [[child]]ren and [[monk]]s in the places where they fought. When the Vikings came to England, the English kings paid them to leave the [[country]], but the Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway. These payments were called [[Danegeld]]. From the [[9th century]] to [[1066]], when the French [[Duke of Normandy]], who became [[King William I]] of England, [[conquer]]ed it, Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England. 
 
 Because of their [[longship]]s, which could float in 4 feet (1.3m) of water, the Vikings were able to make their way up [[river]]s and land deep inside a country. For example they sailed up the [[River Shannon]] in Ireland and built a [[harbour]] 60 miles (100 & nbsp;km) from the [[coast]]. 
 
 There was a difference in who led Viking raids. In the 9th century, Viking Age raids were led by men who may have been [[exile]]s in their own countries. < ref name=Sawyer145 > P.H. Sawyer, ''Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe AD 700–1100'' (London; New York: Methuen, 1982), p. 145 < /ref >  The later Viking raids in the late [[10th century]] and early [[11th century]] and were led by [[King]]s. < ref name=Sawyer145/ >  Some of the early leaders tried to become kings with the riches they plundered from Europe and Russia. Some were successful but most were not. < ref name=Sawyer145/ > 
 
 === In Russia and the Mediterranean === 
 {{see also2|[[Kievan Rus']] and [[Varangians]]}} 
 The Vikings were called Rus' by the peoples [[east]] of the [[Baltic Sea]]. < ref name=Sprague37 > Martina Sprague, ''Sweden: An Illustrated History'' (New York: Hippocrene Books, 2005), p. 37 < /ref >   The Vikings who settled in [[Kiev]] formed the first Russian state. < ref name=Sprague37/ >  The Vikings (Rus') who served the [[Byzantine]] [[Emperor]]s were called [[Varangians]]. They became the personal [[bodyguard]]s to the Emperor and were called the [[Varangian Guard]]. < ref > William L. Urban, ''Medieval Mercenaries: The Business of War'' (London: Greenhill Books, 2006), pp. 23–24 < /ref > 
 
 == Exploration ==  
 The Vikings traveled through Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, southern Europe, northern [[Africa]] and south-western [[Asia]]. Some Vikings sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]] and may have explored places in [[North America]]. The ruins of a Viking settlement have been found at [[L'Anse-aux-Meadows]], [[Newfoundland]]. < ref > F. Donald Logan, ''The Vikings in History'' (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 2006), pp. 82–84 < /ref > < ref name= " ROM " > {{cite web|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|title=Vikings in Canada|url=https://www.rom.on.ca/en/blog/vikings-in-canada|author=Craig Cippola|date=October 18, 2017|accessdate=January 4, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Archaeologists]] used [[radiocarbon dating]] to find out how old the settlement was. Their tests gave them a range of dates from about AD 700 to about AD 1000. < ref > F. Donald Logan, ''The Vikings in History'' (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 2006), p. 86 < /ref > 
 
 == Language == 
 Some English words, and many place names, came from the Scandinavian and Viking language ([[Norse]]). For example, the words ''skirt'' and ''shirt'' came from the word ''skyrta'', meaning a tunic. As English changed, the semantics altered to give us the separate words 'skirt' and 'shirt' we know today. ''Skin'' came from the Norse word ''skinn'' (which meant to strip the meat off something). Some place-names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.viking.no/e/england/danelaw/epl-danelaw.htm |title=Place-names in The Danelaw |first= |last=|work=viking.no |year=2004  < !--[last update]-- >  |accessdate=26 June 2011}} < /ref >  For example, in [[Yorkshire]] places ending with ''thwaite'' meant a ''clearing'' < ref > {{cite web|url=http://thinkexist.com/dictionary/meaning/thwaite/|title=Thwaite Meaning and Definition|first=|last=|work=thinkexist.com|year=2011  < !--[last update]-- > |accessdate=26 June 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  and ''dale'' meant a ''valley''. The word ''thorpe'' meant ''new village'', such as [[Scunthorpe]]. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/conquest/after_viking/legacy_vikings_02.shtml |title=BBC - History - Legacy of the Vikings |first= |last= |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2011  < !--[last update]-- >  |accessdate=26 June 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 == Religion == 
 {{see also2|[[List of Norse gods and goddesses]]}} 
 [[File:Odin, der Göttervater.jpg|thumb|right|200px|{{Center|Odin (also called Woden) the god of [[war]] and death. The day [[Wednesday]] is named for him}}]] 
 The [[Anglo-Saxon]]s called the Vikings [[pagan]]s. They worshiped a great many gods. Viking gods belonged to two groups of gods in Norse [[mythology]]. They either belonged to the [[Aesir]] or the [[Vanir]]. < ref > Yves Bonnefoy, ''American, African, and Old European Mythologies'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), p. 237 < /ref >  The Aesir were gods of war. Aesir means  " gods " . They were the rulers of [[Asgard]]. < ref name=L & G > {{cite web |url=http://www.legendsandchronicles.com/ancient-civilizations/the-vikings/viking-gods/ |title=Viking Gods |author= |website= |publisher=Legends and Chronicles |accessdate=23 June 2015 |archive-date=25 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625140525/http://www.legendsandchronicles.com/ancient-civilizations/the-vikings/viking-gods/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  [[Odin]] was the leader of the Aesir.

The Vanir can also [[Prediction|predict]] the [[future]]. There was a war between the Aesir and the Vanir. When it ended the god [[Njord]] and his children [[Freya]] and [[Freyr]] came to live in Asgard. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.viking-mythology.com/vanir.php |title=Vanir in Norse Mythology |author= |website= |publisher=Viking-Mythology.com|accessdate=23 June 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 The pagan Vikings were exposed to [[Christianity]] from the beginning of the [[Viking Age]]. < ref name=WilliamsBBC > {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/religion_01.shtml |title=Viking Religion |author=Gareth Williams |date=17 Feb 2011 |website= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 June 2015}} < /ref >  They were surrounded by Christian countries. < ref name=Schofield26 > Tracey Ann Schofield, ''Vikings'' (Carthage, IL: Teaching  &  Learning Co, 2002), p. 26 < /ref >  Early Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] were either en[[slave]]d or put to death. < ref name=Schofield26/ >  The Vikings came into contact with Christianity when they raided other areas around them. < ref name=WilliamsBBC/ >  Viking raids produced many Christian slaves who were brought back to Scandinavia. They called Christians  " Cross-men "  because of the [[cross]] in their worship. < ref name=VNet > {{cite web |url=http://www.viking.no/e/life/echristianity.htm |title=The Vikings meet Christianity |author= |website= |publisher=The Viking Network |accessdate=23 June 2015}} < /ref >  In response many Vikings adopted [[Thor]]s hammer as their religious symbol. When Vikings settled in Christian areas they [[Religious conversion|converted]] to Christianity. < ref name=WilliamsBBC/ >  There are still [[Headstone]]s in England with both a [[cross]] and a hammer. Perhaps they thought it was better to be safe than sorry. < ref name=WilliamsBBC/ >  That, or the more gods the better. As some Vikings turned from raiding to trading they found a nominal (in name only) profession of Christianity to be helpful. < ref > Raymond Ian Page, '''Chronicles of the Vikings: Records, Memorials, and Myths'' (Toronto; Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 1995), p. 222 < /ref >  Scandinavia, their [[homeland]], was slower to change to the Christian religion. But by the mid-[[11th century]] most of Norway and Denmark had converted. < ref name=WilliamsBBC/ >  Sweden was converted by the mid-[[12th century]]. < ref name=WilliamsBBC/ >  Overall Scandinavia and the peoples of the [[Baltic Sea]] were the last to accept Christianity. < ref > Robert L. Montgomery, ''The Lopsided Spread of Christianity: Toward an Understanding of the Diffusion of Religions'' (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002), p. 37 < /ref >   
 
 The Viking's religion affected Christianity as well. The pagan celebration of [[Yuletide]] became [[Christmas]] along with the custom of the [[Christmas tree]]. < ref name=VNet/ >  [[Priest]]s blessing the fields took the place of pagan [[fertility rite]]s of [[spring]] held to make sure there was a good [[harvest]]. < ref name=VNet/ >  Norse kept their  " farm gods "  well after Christianity just to make sure they were protected. [[Santa Claus]] owes much of his legend to the Norse god Odin. With his snow-white beard he traveled the mid[[winter]] sky on his eight-footed [[horse|steed]] [[Sleipnir]] visiting his people with gifts. He became [[Father Christmas]]. Blended with the Christian [[Saint Nicholas]] he (they) became Santa Claus.  < ref name=VNet/ > 
 
 ==In fiction and theater== 
 
 In the late 19th century (the 1800s), [[Richard Wagner]] and other artists in the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]] made [[opera]]s and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture.  They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans.  They came up with the idea of Vikings wearing fur clothes and helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns.  Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not.  Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera ''Ring des Nibelungen'' so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings. < ref name= " Vox " > {{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/4/29/11526568/vikings-horned-helmets|title=Vikings never wore horned helmets.
