 A '''furlong''' is a [[unit of measurement|unit]] for measuring [[distance]]. It is part of the [[imperial units|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|US customary]] systems. It is equal to {{convert|660|ft|3|disp=or|abbr=off}}. There are eight furlongs in a [[mile]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The unit was first used in the ninth century at the latest. The word  " furlong "  comes from [[Old English]] words ''furh'' ( " furrow " ) and ''lang'' ( " long " ). Originally it was the length of the [[wiktionary:furrow|furrow]] in one [[acre]] of a ploughed field. An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one [[chain (unit)|chain]] wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an ''acre's length''. Around the year 1300, England standardized the furlong as 40 [[rod (unit)|rods]] or 660 feet. 
 
 The length of the furlong was standardized between [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] , [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]] in the International Pound and Yard Agreement. 
 
 The furlong was abolished for official use in the UK in 1985. It is still occasionally seen on [[traffic sign|road signs]] in Myanmar. 
 
 Distances for [[horse racing]] in the UK, Ireland, and Canada are still given in miles and furlongs. The unit is not used otherwise. It is considered to be an ''archaic'' unit. 
 
 The [[proverb]] ''one furlong per fortnight'' means to express something in as obscure and little-used units as possible. (A fortnight is two weeks, or fourteen days). The proverb itself means speed, and is the same as 0.000166309524 m/s or 0.17 mm/s.
