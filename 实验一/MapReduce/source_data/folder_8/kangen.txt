 ==Events of the ''Kangen'' era== 
 * '''1244''' (''Kangen 2, 4th month''): [[Kujō Yoritsugu]] had his coming-of-age ceremonies at age 6.  In the same month, Yoritsune asked Emperor Go-Saga for permission to make Yoritsugu the new shogun. < ref name= " titsingh247 " > Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ & pg=PA247   pp. 247]. < /ref > 
 * '''11 Septembe 1245''' (''Kangen 3, 7th month''):  Yoshitsune shaved his head and became a Buddhist priest. < ref name= " titsingh247 " / > 
 * '''1246''' (''Kangen 4, 7th month''): Yoritsune's son, now Shogun Yoritsugu (who is only 7 years old) marries the sister of [[Hōjō Tsunetoki]]. < ref name= " titsingh247 " / > 
 * '''1246''' (''Kangen 4''): In the 4th year of Go-Saga's reign, the emperor abdicated; and the succession (''senso'') was received by his 4-year-old son.  Soon after, Emperor Go-Fukakusa's role as emperor is confirmed by [[wikt:ceremony|ceremonies]] (''sokui''). < ref > Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ & pg=PA247   pp. 247-248;]  Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].
