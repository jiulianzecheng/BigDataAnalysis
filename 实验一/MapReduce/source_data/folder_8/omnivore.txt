 An '''omnivore''' is an animal whose [[species]] gets its [[energy]] and [[nutrient]]s from a [[diet]] made up of foods that include [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Omnivore|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/omnivore/?ar_a=4 & ar_r=3|work=National Geographic Education|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=10 July 2016|archive-date=9 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109125548/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/omnivore/?ar_a=4 & ar_r=3|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Many omnivores change their eating habits during their life cycle. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/171414/|title=Omnivore|website=www.eoearth.org|accessdate=2016-04-03}} < /ref >  They are sometimes called  " life-history omnivores " , because they are only omnivores if their whole life is considered. 
 
 Some [[species]], such as grazing [[waterfowl]] like [[geese]], are known to eat mainly animals at one stage of their lives, but plants at another. < ref name= " MacleanRoberts " > Maclean, Gordon Lindsay (1993). ''Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa''. Publisher: New Holland. {{ISBN|978-0620175838}}. < /ref >  Also, many insects, such as the beatle family [[Meloidae]], < ref > Skaife S.H. 1953. ''African insect life''. Longmans, Green, London. < /ref >  eat animal tissue when they are [[larva]]e, but eat plant matter after they mature. 
 
 ==Animal types== 
 All of these animals are omnivores, but have different feeding [[behavior]]s and [[wikt:favorite|favorite]] foods. Being omnivores gives these animals more food security in stressful times. It also makes it easier for them to live in less consistent [[environment]]s; (those that change along with the [[season]], for example). < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/04/20/150817741/for-most-of-human-history-being-an-omnivore-was-no-dilemma|title=For most of human history, being an omnivore was no dilemma |website=NPR.org|date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=2016-04-03|last1=Shute |first1=Nancy }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Human]]s, many [[pig]]s, many [[bear]]s, some [[primate]]s, some [[rodent]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[Rallidae|rails]], [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]]s, most [[seagull]]s, and other animals are omnivores.
