 {{Greek alphabet|letter=sampi}} 
 '''Sampi''' or '''Disigma''' is a mysterious Greek symbol. Its meaning is still debated today. Some believe it to be a replacement of 'san'. Before that, it was a letter that was used in the [[Greek alphabet]] in a few Greek cities in the 5th century BC. At that time, it looked like [[File:Greek Sampi Ionian.svg|x16px]] or [[File:Greek Sampi Pamphylian.svg|x16px]]. It was probably pronounced like  " ts "  or  " tch "  in the dialect of those cities. Over time, it was changed from [[File:Greek Sampi Ionian.svg|x16px|Í²]] to [[File:Greek uncial Sampi.svg|x16px]] or [[File:Greek uncial Sampi 02.svg|x16px]] and at last to [[File:Sampi.svg|x16px]]. Eventually, the letter came out of use, while it was still used to denote  " 900 "  in the system of [[Greek numerals]].
