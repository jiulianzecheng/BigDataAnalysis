 == Musical style == 
 Booba was influenced by the American hip-hop stage of the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s--Mobb Deep, [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], and [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]]. The dark melodies accompanied with raw texts, typical of the rap from New York, are present on every album of his. He is often criticized for making the apology of easy money and murder. Booba advocates a reduction in the taxes and claims himself in support of individual freedom. < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20080322035109/http://www.lehiphop.com/interviews/itw62-booba_par_pamsiste.html Interview at]. lehiphop.com < /ref >  Racism is a recurring topic of his songs (see for example  " Couleur ébène " ,  " Pitbull " ,  " Ma Couleur " ), although he sometimes deliberately advocates communitarian positions. < ref > [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xju7j_hhqc-en#.UOA4wayyHMo HHQC Entrevue Avec Booba (Partie 3)].
