'''Surge''' was a [[soft drink]] manufactured (made) by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. The product was made mostly in the [[United States]] beginning in early 1997. The soda was marketed as a substitute to [[Mountain Dew]]. It was created because Coca-Cola wanted to take customers from [[Pepsi]]. The brand was very popular at first, but that didn't last. 
 
 Surge stopped being made in 2003. Surge was re-released by Coca-Cola as an Amazon exclusive in packs of 12 16oz cans because of the success of the  " Surge Movement "  campaign on September 15, 2014. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/surge-returns-back-by-popular-demand-brand-now-available-exclusively-on-amazoncom|accessdate=2014-09-15|title=SURGE Returns: Back by Popular Demand, Brand Now Available Exclusively on Amazon.com|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|archive-date=2014-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915143130/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/surge-returns-back-by-popular-demand-brand-now-available-exclusively-on-amazoncom|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
