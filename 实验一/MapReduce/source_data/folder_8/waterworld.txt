 ==Plot== 
 
 Some time in the [[future]], after [[global warming]], the [[north pole|polar]] [[ice]]caps have melted. The [[Earth]] is almost entirely covered with [[water]]. The humans that are still alive have forgotten the past. Most people believe the world was created in a [[flood]]. It is [[blasphemy]] to believe anything else. There is, however, a belief of many peoples that dry land exists. 
 
 The peoples can be [[classification|classified]] into four groups: 
 * ''Drifters'': People who sail alone in small boats. They collecting things and trade with one each other as well as with atolls; 
 * ''Atoll Dwellers'': People who live in large floating [[building|constructs]] called ''atolls''. 
 * ''Smokers'': [[Pirate]]s who live on old [[oil]] [[ship|tankers]]. They are called smokers because of the [[smoke]] they make by using oil-powered [[wikt:equipment|equipment]]. 
 * ''Slavers'' were mentioned by the drifter the Mariner meets early in the movie but not shown. 
 
 The main [[fictional character|character]] in the movie is a [[drifter]] (Kevin Costner). For most of the movie, he has no name. People call him  " the Mariner. "  He is a [[Mutation|genetic mutant]], with [[Syndactyly|webbed feet]] and [[gills]]. He also appears to have very good reflexes. 
 
 The Atollers offer a trade with the Mariner: if he will stay with them long enough to get one of their women [[pregnant]] they will give him all the supplies he needs. The Mariner does not accept their offer. He does not like being around many people. The Atoll's leaders are mad about this. They have him [[arrest]]ed. During the fight to capture him, they learn that he is a mutant. They fear him and plan to  " recycle "  ([[execution|execute]]) him in the Atoll's old dump for domestic waste. 
 
 As they get ready to  " recycle "  the Mariner, the Smokers attack. Their leader is the Deacon. He is the  " captain "  of an old [[oil tanker]], the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' ( " the 'Deez " ). They are looking for a young girl named Enola. She has a map to Dryland [[tattoo]]ed on her back. One of their [[spy|spies]] told them that she was there. Enola lives with her [[guardian]], Helen, a woman in her twenties or thirties. Helen and Enola plan to escape with Gregor (the Atoll's [[astrologer]]/[[engineer]]) in search of Dryland. Like the Mariner, they do not fit in with the other people. 
 
 Gregor's escape [[balloon]] is [[accident]]ally let loose too early (with him on it). This leaves Helen and Enola on the Atoll as the Smokers attack it. They free the Mariner after he says he will take them with him. They all escape on his ship. 
 
 Helen learns that the Mariner knows where Dryland is and wants to see it. The Mariner puts her in a [[diving bell]] made out of [[plastic]] and swims down to a sunken [[city]] (actually the city of [[Denver]]) to show her. While they are looking at the sunken city, the Smokers find the Mariner's vessel and take control of it. Enola hides on the ship. When the Mariner and Helen return to the surface, the Smokers capture them. The Deacon wants the Mariner and Helen to tell him where Enola is, but they will not help him find her. The Deacon pretends to [[kill]] the Mariner and Helen by firing a [[gun]] into the [[sky]]. This scares Enola out of hiding and she is captured by the Smokers. The Deacon has his crew burn the Mariner's [[vessel]] and shoot at them, but they escape by diving deeper underwater than the [[bullet]]s can reach. Since the Mariner can breathe underwater, he  " breathes "  for both of them using a [[kiss]]. 
 
 Gregor soon appears in his [[fly]]ing [[machine]]. He tells them that it was  " good thinking "  to burn the boat. Gregor then takes them to where a new Atoll is being built. The Mariner tells everyone that he is going to rescue Enola. No one else will help him. 
 
 The Mariner goes after the ''Exxon Valdez'' on a stolen [[jetski]]. The Deacon and his crew are [[celebration|celebrating]] finding  " the map to Dryland " . Unfortunately, neither the Deacon nor his crew has any idea how to ''read'' the map. Based on the shape of the area of Dryland, the Deacon believes that the area must be [[Japan]]. The crew begins to row the large ship with huge [[oar]]s, in the style of a [[Viking]] [[longship]]. 
 
 The Mariner walks out onto the empty [[deck]] of the ship and threatens to throw a [[fire|flare]] down into the oil holds unless the Deacon returns Enola. The Deacon does not believe Enola's warning that the Mariner never [[bluff]]s. He refuses and tells the Mariner that he would be [[insanity|crazy]] to blow up the ship. The Mariner drops the flare into the oil hold. The flare causes the oil catch on fire. This destroys the 'Deez in a large [[explosion]]. 
 
 The Mariner frees Enola and escapes the ship which sinks. They float at sea for a while and then have one last [[battle]] with the Deacon (who survived the blast) before being rescued by Gregor. Gregor understands the map and leads them in the direction of what does, in fact, turn out to be Dryland: [[Mount Everest]]. Gregor, Enola, Helen and the others start to rebuild [[civilization]] on the [[island]]. The Mariner builds a boat and sails away, back to his old life.
