 '''Zircon''' is a [[silicate]] [[mineral]]. It is found in many different places in almost all kinds of rock. The chemical it is made up of is called  ''zirconium silicate'':  ZrSiO < sub > 4 < /sub > . Clear zircon may look like [[diamond]] and has been used as a cheaper replacement for diamond.  It is not the same as cubic zirconia, which is man-made zirconium dioxide.  In the [[United States]], zircon is considered to be the birth stone for the month of December.

 Zircons from the [[Jack Hills]] in the Narryer [[Gneiss]] Terrane, [[Yilgarn Craton]], [[Western Australia]], have yielded U–Pb ([[Uranium-lead dating|uranium–lead]] [[radioactive dating]]) ages up to 4.404 billion years. < ref name= " Wilde " > {{cite journal|author=Wilde S.A., Valley J.W., Peck W.H. and Graham C.M.|year=2001|title=Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago|journal=Nature|volume=409|issue=6817|pages=175–178|url=http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/Wilde2001Nature.pdf|doi=10.1038/35051550|pmid=11196637|s2cid=4319774}} < /ref >  This is judged to be the age of [[crystal]]lization, making them the oldest minerals so far dated on Earth. In addition, the [[oxygen]] [[isotope|isotopic]] compositions of some of these zircons indicate that more than 4.4 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the Earth. < ref name= " Wilde "  / > < ref > {{cite journal|author=Mojzsis, S.J., Harrison, T.M., Pidgeon, R.T.|year=2001|title= Oxygen-isotope evidence from ancient zircons for liquid water at the Earth's surface 4300 Myr ago|journal=Nature|volume=409|issue=6817|pages=178–181|doi=10.1038/35051557|pmid=11196638|s2cid=2819082}} < /ref >  This interpretation is supported by additional trace element data, < ref > {{cite journal|author=Ushikubo, T., Kita, N.T., Cavosie, A.J., Wilde, S.A.
