 '''Aberdeenshire''' ({{lang-gd|Siorrachd Obar Dheathain}}) is the name of both a [[county]] and of one of the 32 [[unitary authority|unitary]] [[Council area (Scotland)|council areas]] in [[Scotland]].  The two are not the same area. 
 
 == County == 
 [[File:Aberdeenshire Brit Isles Sect 2.svg|right|thumb|180px|County of Aberdeenshire]] 
 Aberdeenshire stretches from the east coast of Scotland up into the mountains.  It is between [[Kincardineshire]] and [[Angus]] (south) and [[Banffshire]] (west).  [[Aberdeen]] is the county town. 
 
 Aberdeenshire is mainly countryside and mountain, except in Aberdeen.  Aberdeen is one of Britain's richest towns because it serves the North Sea oil rigs. 
 
 [[Fraserburgh]] is a large fishing port. 
 
 == Council area == 
 [[File:View NE from summit of B976 - geograph.org.uk - 443153.jpg|thumb|left|Aberdeenshire]] 
 The Aberdeenshire council area takes in the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire and half of Banffshire.  It does not include [[Aberdeen City]] though, which is a Council Area in its own right. However, Aberdeenshire Council does have its headquarters at Woodhill House, in [[Aberdeen]]; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outside its area's border. 
 
 Aberdeenshire borders [[Angus]] and [[Perth and Kinross]] to the south, and [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] and [[Moray]] to the west.
