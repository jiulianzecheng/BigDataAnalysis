 A '''duel''' is a fight of the two people who have similar deadly [[weapon]]s and have agreed to a set of [[rule]]s before the fight takes place. The fight is usually about a matter of [[honor]]. The goal of a duel is not usually to kill the opponent but to restore the honor of the man who declared the duel. Duels are not official laws, they are carried out by individuals. 
 
 Duels were practiced from the [[15th century|15th]] to [[20th century]] in Western societies. [[Burr–Hamilton duel|For example]], in 1804 in the United States the politicians [[Aaron Burr]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] had a duel. Since the American Civil War, all U.S. states have criminalized dueling, with punishments for dueling ranging from not being allowed to run for public office to the death penalty. Dueling was outlawed because groups against dueling formed and were successful. < ref > pp. 372 – 374, Volume 8, ''Funk  &  Wagnalls New Encyclopedia.'' 1983.

 ==Rules== 
 Duels could be fought with [[sword]]s or [[pistol]]s. 
 
 The person who felt offended or dishonored had to  " [[wikt:challenge|challenge]] "  his opponent to a duel. This was usually done by throwing his [[glove]] down in front of the opponent or by hitting him in the face with a glove. Each person had to then find a person to be his  " second " . The job of the seconds was to choose a place to duel and to decide whether or not the weapons were equal. 
 
 The person who declared the duel got to choose when the duel would be finished. Common endings to duels were: 
 *until one person was injured, even if the [[injury]] was minor 
 *until one person could no longer fight because he was too hurt 
 *until one person was [[death|killed]] or injured so badly that he would soon die 
 *duels with pistols could be ended after the first shot, even if no one was hit. Most pistol duels did not go longer than 3 shots
