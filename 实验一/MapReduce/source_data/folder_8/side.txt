[[File:Geometrie carre.png|thumb|A [[square (geometry)|square]] with four sides]] 
 In [[geometry]], a '''side''' is a straight [[line]] that is part of a [[shape]]. A shape made of straight lines is called a [[polygon]]. The number of sides on a polygon can be written as  < math > n < /math > . 
 
 A '''side''' can also mean the face of a [[3D]] shape. A 3D shape made of flat faces is called a [[polyhedron]]. The number of faces on a polyhedron can be written as  < math > F < /math > . < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Side|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Side.html|access-date=2020-09-25|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of Side|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/side.html|access-date=2020-09-25|website=www.mathsisfun.com}} < /ref > 
 
 As an example, the [[square (geometry)|square]] on the right has four sides. The sides in this [[picture]] are made with [[black]] [[straight]] [[line]]s. The four sides are: 
 # the black straight line from A to B 
 # the black straight line from B to C 
 # the black straight line from C to D 
 # the black straight line from D to A 
 
 ==Other uses== 
 *A side may also mean a part of something. For example, on a [[human]] [[body]], the ''right side'' means the parts of the body that make up the right [[wikt:half|half]] of the body.   
 *[[Inside]] and [[outside]] are terms use to show where something is. If something is inside, it is in something. For example, the sentence  " The [[cookie]]s are inside of the [[container]]. "  means that the cookies are in the container. The area within the canister is the inside of the canister. The outside is the area not in the canister. Outside is the opposite of inside.
