 '''Methylphenidate''' is a [[drug]] which is similar to [[amphetamine]]. Its name is often shortened to '''MPH''' but is better known by the brand name of '''Ritalin''' or '''Concerta'''. MPH stimulates the [[central nervous system]]. It does this by increasing [[dopamine]] transmission in the [[brain]]. < ref name= " pmid10440465 " > {{cite journal |author=Markowitz JS, Logan BK, Diamond F, Patrick KS |title=Detection of the novel metabolite ethylphenidate after methylphenidate overdose with alcohol coingestion |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=362â€“6 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10440465 |doi=10.1097/00004714-199908000-00013 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00004714-199908000-00013 |access-date=2009-04-14 |archive-date=2017-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611224155/http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0271-0749 & volume=19 & issue=4 & spage=362 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The drug is commonly used to treat [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[narcolepsy]]. It is sometimes used together with other drugs to treat [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. In most countries, its use needs to be [[prescription|prescribed]] by a [[Medical doctor|doctor]]. 
 
 The most common [[side-effect]]s of taking the drug are [[nervousness]] and [[insomnia|sleeping problems]]. About one in ten patients see these problems. Other side-effects include changes of [[blood pressure]], [[headache]], and [[weight loss]]. Some cases of  [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[psychosis]] have been reported, amongst others. 
 
 Sometimes, the drug has been prescribed to children without proper ADHD diagnosis to increase their academic performance.  This use has been criticised by the [[media]]. Using methylphenidate in children may be problematic, because it has been linked with slower growth. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.care.com/c/stories/6641/yes-or-no-does-adhd-stimulant-medication-su/|title=Yes or No?: Does ADHD Stimulant Medication Suppress Growth?|first=Care com|last=Inc|website=Care.com}} < /ref >  The media often use the name '''Ritalin''' for all drugs containing methylphenidate, and even for other stimulants used to treat ADHD. Ritalin is one drug containing methylphenidate, which is often used in such cases. 
 
 This drug can also cause euphoria when it is abused for recreational purposes. Abusing Methylphenidate may lead to psychological addiction and to severe side effects- including, but not limited to: psychosis, cardiac arrest, and death.
