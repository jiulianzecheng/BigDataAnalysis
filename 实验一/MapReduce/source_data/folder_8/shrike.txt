 '''Shrikes''' are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Laniidae'''. The family has 31 species in three [[genus|genera]]. The family name, ''[[Lanius]]'', is [[wikt:derive|derived]] from the [[Latin]] word for  " [[butcher]] " . Some shrikes were also known as  " butcher birds "  because of their feeding habits. This is because shrike sometimes sticks its prey on a thorn, as on a meat hook. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/542035/shrike |title=shrike (bird) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |first=  |encyclopedia=britannica.com |year=2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}} < /ref >  This makes it easier for them to feed on it.
