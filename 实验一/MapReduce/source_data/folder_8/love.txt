 '''Love''' is a mix of feelings and actions that shows a deep liking for someone or something. Love involves caring for another. Romantic love can lead to things such as [[dating]], [[marriage]] and [[sex]], but a person can also feel for [[friends]], such as platonic love, or [[family]]. 
 There are also [[chemical reaction]]s within the brain that can be triggered by the different types of love. 
 
 == Forms of love == 
 There are many kinds of love. There can be [[pride|self-love]], love towards a friend (such as [[platonic love]]), love in romance, towards [[family]], toward [[God|God(s)]], or towards an object or idea.  
 Often love can be confused with other feelings. Being [[sexual attraction|sexually]] or [[Human body|physically]] attracted is the feeling of [[lust]]. Lust and love may be thought of as different. Normal [[friendship]] is a form of love that can be distracted by lust and misunderstanding.

 == First love == 
 People [[wikt:describe|describe]] the person that they first loved romantically as their  " first love. "  For example, in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Romeo is Juliet's very first love. At that time, she was only 13. In [[Maria Edgeworth]]'s book ''[[Belinda (book)|Belinda]]'', Mr. Vincent says,  " First loves are silly things. " 
 
 == Chemical basis == 
 The [[Biology|biological]] [[model]] of lust is different from love because it is more like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]]. < ref name= " Lewis " > {{cite book |last= Lewis |first= Thomas |author2= Amini F.  &  Lannon R. |title= A general theory of love |url= https://archive.org/details/generaltheoryof00lewi |publisher= Random House |year= 2000 |isbn=0-375-70922-3}} < /ref >  Helen Fisher, an expert in the topic of romantic love, divides it into three stages: [[lust]], attraction, and attachment. Lust makes people like each other, attraction encourages people to focus on [[mate|mating]], and attachment helps people tolerate the spouse (or the child). 
 
 [[Lust]] is the [[wikt:passion|passionate]] [[sexual]] [[wikt:desire|desire]] that promotes mating. This usually lasts only a few weeks or months. [[Attraction]] is more for one person specially. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] say that as people fall in love, the brain releases chemicals, including [[dopamine]]. These chemicals make people less hungry and sleepy, and also adds an intense feeling of excitement. Research shows that this stage normally lasts from one and a half to three years. < ref name= " human " > {{cite book

 Since these lust and attraction stages are both described as [[temporary]], a third stage might describe long-term love. Attachment can be used to describe the [[bonding]] [[period]] that helps keep partners together for many years. Attachment occurs in the longer [[term]]. 
 
 ==Love and health== 
 Love has consequences for [[health]] and well-being. Joyful activities such as love activate areas in the [[brain]] responsible for [[emotion]], attention, 
 motivation and [[memory]], and it may further lead to reduction of [[cortisol]], which reduces [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]. < ref > Esch, Tobias;  &  Stefano, George B. (2005).
