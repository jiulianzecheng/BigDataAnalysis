 == Types of albums == 
 There are two main types of albums, studio albums and live albums. Studio albums are recorded at a [[recording studio]]. Live albums are normally recorded while the musicians are performing for an [[audience]]. Live albums are usually recorded at [[concert]]s.  
 
 Other types of albums include: 
 * '''Compilation album''': Compilation albums are usually made of songs that first came from many different albums. These songs can all be from the same musicians (often called  " Greatest Hits "  albums) or they can each be from different musicians. 
 * '''Debut album''': the first album from a musician or musical group. 
 * '''Solo album''' - A solo album is an album by a single musician. This often happens when a [[singer]] or musician who is a part of a [[band]] creates an album without the rest of the band. It may also happen when the person leaves the band and starts [[performance|performing]] alone. For example, most of [[Beyonc√©]]'s albums after she stopped performing with [[Destiny's Child]] are solo albums.   
 * '''Tribute album''': Tribute albums or  " cover albums "  are albums where a second group or musician plays songs which were first played by another, often more famous, group or musician.  The second group is usually called a  " Tribute band "  when most or all of the music they play is from another [[band]].  For example, a [[Slipknot]] tribute band would mostly play songs that were written and played by the band Slipknot. 
 *'''Live album''': Live albums are made from songs that are performed live, such as during tour. 
 
 == Tracks==  < !-- Linked to from [[Track (music)]] -- > 
 Albums are normally separated into ''Tracks''. Each track is a part of the album which has one song in it. The term is often used to mean a specific song on the album by number. For example, the  " fourth track "  or  " track four "  from an album is the fourth song on the album when it is played from the beginning.
