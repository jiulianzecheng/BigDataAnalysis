 ==History== 
 The word Binda is thought to be from the [[Gandangara]] [[indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for deep water. 
 
 The first Europeans in the Binda area were the explorers [[James Meehan]] and [[John Oxley]] in 1820. People began living in the area in the 1840s. [[Police]] were based at Binda in 1840 to protect local farmers from [[bushranger]]s. < ref name=smh/ >  The town was begun in 1851. Blocks of land in the town were made ready for sale in 1852. It was the first town in the area to have a [[school]], [[post office]], [[police station]] and a [[courthouse]]. < ref name = ult > {{cite web|url= http://www.upperlachlantourism.com/binda.htm|title= Binda, New South Wales|access-date= 2008-08-13|work= Upper Lachlan Tourism|archive-date= 2008-12-01|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201095700/http://www.upperlachlantourism.com/binda.htm|url-status= dead}} < /ref >  At Funny Hill, a sheep farm, a [[racing]] track for horses was made and the Binda Picnic Races began in 1848. < ref name=smh/ >
