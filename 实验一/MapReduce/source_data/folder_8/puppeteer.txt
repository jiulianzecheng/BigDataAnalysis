 A '''puppeteer''' is a person who makes an inanimate object that might be shaped like a [[human]], [[animal]], [[legendary creature]], or another object to create the illusion that the [[puppet]] is  " alive " . The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs.
