'''Pachyderm''' (meaning 'thick skin', from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang-grc|παχύς|pachys|thick|label=none}}, and {{lang-grc|δέρμα|derma|skin|label=none}}) is an old term for 
 [[elephants]], [[rhinoceros]]es and [[hippopotamuses]]. 
 
 [[Genetics]] has now shown that rhinos, hippos, and elephants are not closely related to each other. Rhinos are closely related to [[tapirs]], but both rhinos and tapirs are much more closely related to horses than to hippos or elephants.  
 
 ==Family== 
 The closest relatives of hippos are [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s. Hippos and whales are more closely related to [[cow]]s, [[pig]]s, [[deer]], [[antelope]]s, and [[giraffe]]s than other pachyderms.  
 
 The closest relatives of elephants seem to be [[manatee]]s, [[dugong]]s, and [[hyrax]]es, which are all only distantly related to other pachyderms. 
 
 Instead of being descended from a common ancestor, today's science shows that these animals just made similar [[adaptation]]s independently through [[convergent evolution]]. 
 
 Elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses are classified as separate [[clade]]s altogether. Rhinos, hippos, pigs, peccaries, horses, [[zebra]]s, [[donkey]]s and tapirs are classified in clade [[Laurasiatheria]], < ref > Zhou, Xuming ''et al'' 2011.
