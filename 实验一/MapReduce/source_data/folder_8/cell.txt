 In [[biology]], the '''cell''' is the basic structure of [[organism]]s. All cells are made by the [[cell division|division]] of other cells. 
 
 The [[environment]] outside the cell is separated from the [[cytoplasm]] inside the cell by the [[cell membrane]]. Inside some cells, parts of the cell stay separate from other parts. These separate parts are called [[organelle]]s (like small [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]). They each do different things in the cell. Examples are the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (where [[DNA]] is), and [[mitochondria]] (where [[chemical energy]] is converted). < ref > Alberts B. ''et al.'' 2002.

 == Kinds of cells == 
 Cell can be divided into different types depending on the structure of the nucleus and the physiological function.  In 1957 cells were divided into two types based on the structure of nucleus.  These were the [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cell and the eukaryotic cell.  Prokaryotes, such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], are simple cells that have no [[cell nucleus]].  They do have [[bacterial microcompartment]]s. 
 
 Eukaryotes are complex cells with many organelles and other structures in the cell. They are larger than prokaryote cells: they can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. Eukaryotes store their [[genetic]] information ([[DNA]]) on [[chromosome]]s in the [[cell nucleus]]. [[Organism]]s (living things) which are made up of multiple cells are eukaryotes. 
 
 Most cells are small, the largest just being seen by the human eye (egg cell). They need to be small in order to work as they should. < ref > Al-Khalili, Jim  2022.

 == Kinds of prokaryotic organisms == 
 The only kinds of prokaryotic organisms are [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. < ref > Murat, Dorothee; Byrne, Meghan; Komeili, Arash 2010. Cell Biology of Prokaryotic Organelles. ''Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology''. '''2''' (10): a000422. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20739411/] < /ref >  Prokaryotic organisms evolved before eukaryotic organisms, so at one point the world consisted of nothing but prokaryotic organisms. There are also [[virus]]es, which are biological organisms. They ''always'' reproduce inside the cells of other organisms. They cause some important [[disease]]s. Viruses are made of [[RNA]], or DNA, and [[protein]], and they reproduce themselves inside the cells of bacteria or eukaryotes. 
 
 == Regions of prokaryotic cell == 
 The prokaryotic cell has three regions namely the cell envelope, cytoplasmic region and [[Flagellum|flagella]] or [[Pilus|pili]]. 
 
 * '''Cell envelope:''' This consists of the plasma membrane covered by a cell wall. Some bacteria have a third layer called a capsule. Prokaryotes such as [[Mycoplasma]] and [[Thermoplasma]] only have a cell membrane layer. The envelope gives protection to the cell and separates the inside of the cell from its environment. 
 * '''Cytoplasmic region:''' This region is found inside the cell and contains the genome (DNA), ribosomes and other cell inclusions. Since prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, the genetic material is free in the cytoplasm. 
 * '''Flagella/Pili:''' These structures are not present in all prokaryotes. The flagella and pili extends from the surface of the cell, and they help in movement and communication between cells < ref > https://web.archive.org/web/20210307231908/https://web.archive.org/web/20130507094245/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/genetics_cell.html < /ref > 
 
 == Kinds of eukaryotic organisms == 
 === Unicellular === 
 [[File:Paramecium.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[Paramecium]]'', a single-celled organism]] 
 [[File:Simple diagram of animal cell (en).svg|alt=Diagram of animal cell|thumb|250px|A simple diagram of an animal cell]] 
 [[File:Simple diagram of plant cell (en).svg|alt=Plant cell diagram|thumb|250px|A simple diagram of a plant cell]] 
 [[Unicellular organism]]s are made up of one cell. Examples of unicellular organisms are: 
 * [[Amoeba]] 
 * [[Paramecium]] 
 
 Unicellular organisms need to: 
 * eat 
 * respire (most use [[oxygen]] to make [[sugar]] into [[energy]]) 
 
 All unicellular organisms must: 
 * get rid of waste (discard) 
 * reproduce (make more of itself) 
 * grow 
 
 Some may: 
 * move 
 * sense their [[environment]] 
 * get their energy from the sun (e.g., [[cyanobacteria]]) 
 * [[fermentation|ferment]] (e.g., yeasts) 
 * use [[anaerobic respiration]] (e.g. ''[[Clostridium]] botulinum'') 
 
 === Multicellular === 
 [[Multicellular organism]]s are made from many cells. They are [[complex]] organisms. This can be a small number of cells, or millions or trillions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The cells of a multicellular organism are not all the same. They have different shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. The cells are specialised, this means they do only some kinds of work. By themselves, they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live. They need other cells to do other work. They live together, but cannot live alone. 
 
 == Cell history == 
 Cells were discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] (1635–1703). He used a compound [[microscope]] with two [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] to look at the structure of [[Cork (material)|cork]], and to look at leaves and some [[insect]]s. He did this from about 1660, and reported it in his book ''Micrographica'' in 1665. He named cells after the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''cella'', meaning room. He did this because he thought cells looked like small rooms. 
 
 Many other [[naturalist]]s and [[philosopher]]s tried out the new instrument. The structure of [[plant]]s was investigated by [[Nehemiah Grew]] (1641–1712) and [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694). Grew's major work was ''The anatomy of plants'' (1682). < ref name= " Harris " > Harris H. 1999. ''The birth of the cell''. Yale University Press, New Haven. < /ref >  It is not clear who first saw animal cells, Malpighi, [[Jan Swammerdam]] (1637–1680) or [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723). < ref name= " Harris " / > < sup > p17 < /sup > 
 
 Leeuwenhoek's discoveries and drawings of 'little animalcules' opened up a whole new world for naturalists. [[Protozoa]], and [[microorganism]]s generally were discovered, and the discoveries about them are still going on today. [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]]'s book ''Die Infusionsthierchen'' summarised what was known in 1838. Lorenz Oken (1779–1851) in 1805 wrote that infusoria (microscopic forms) were the basis of all life.  
 
 The idea that cells were the basis of the larger forms of life came in the 18th century. Finding out who did the work has taken some time: 
 : " The work of the [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Jan Purkyně]] (1787–1869) and his student and collaborator [[Gabriel Valentin]] (1810–1883) was unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority in the cell theory " . < ref name=Harris/ > < sup > Chapter 9 < /sup >  [[Johannes Müller]] (1801–1858) also made great contributions.  " It was, however, his student [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882) and [[Matthias Schleiden]] (1804–1881) who got the credit for the ''[[cell theory]]'', despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and their credits to previous workers were  " a travesty " . < ref name= " Harris " / > < sup > p97 < /sup >   
 
 The cell theory includes these important ideas:  < ref > Gall J.G.  &  McIntosh J.R. (eds) 2001. ''Landmark papers in cell biology''. Bethesda MD and Cold Spring Harbor NY: The American Society for Cell Biology and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. < /ref > 
 # All living things are made of cells. 
 # The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in all organisms. 
 # Every cell comes from another cell that lived before it. 
 # The nucleus is the core element of the cell. 
 
 == Cell reproduction == 
 The body cells of [[metazoa]]ns divide by simple [[mitosis|mitotic]] [[cell division]]. [[Sexual reproduction]] is ancestral in eukaryotes, and in metazoa it is carried out by specialised sex cells. They are produced by a process called [[meiosis]].  
 
 Prokaryotic cells reproduce using [[binary fission]], where the cell simply splits in half. For both mitosis and binary fission the cell must replicate (copy) all its genetic information ([[DNA]]) so that each new cell will have a copy.
