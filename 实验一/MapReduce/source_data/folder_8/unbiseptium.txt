'''Unbiseptium''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|uː|n|b|aɪ|ˈ|s|ɛ|p|t|i|əm}}, also called '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[americium]]''',{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} is the hypothetical chemical element with atomic number '''127''' and symbol '''Ubs'''. It comes immediately after [[unbihexium]], element 126, which is expected to be the most stable element on an [[island of stability]]. < ref name= " emsley " / > 
   
 ==Naming== 
 
 {{further|Systematic element name}} 
   
 The name unbiseptium is a systematic element name, used as a placeholder until its discovery is confirmed. [[Transuranium element]]s beyond [[californium]] are always created artificially, and the element usually ends up being named for a scientist or a laboratory that does work in atomic physics.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} 
   
 ==Synthesis of unbiseptium== 
 
 Unbiseptium has had one failed attempt at [[Synthetic element|synthesis]] in 1978 at the Darmstadt UNILAC accelerator by bombarding a natural [[tantalum]] target with [[xenon]] ions. < ref name= " emsley " > {{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|url=https://archive.org/details/naturesbuildingb0000emsl_b1k4|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/naturesbuildingb0000emsl_b1k4/page/593 593]}} < /ref >
