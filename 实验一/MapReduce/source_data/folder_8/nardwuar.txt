 '''John Ruskin''' (born July 5, 1968), better known as '''Nardwuar the Human Serviette''' or simply '''Nardwuar''', is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[interview]]er and musician. He is the [[lead singer]] and [[keyboardist]] for the [[garage rock]] band [[The Evaporators]]. He is best known for his quirky appearance and style of interview. He does a lot of [[research]] on people he interviews. In his interviews, mostly with [[rapper]]s and other musicians, he will bring up something about the interviewee that is not very well known to the public to confuse, scare or impress them. For example, during an interview with [[Pharrell Williams]] from [[N.E.R.D]], Nardwuar pulled out a [[vinyl record]] featuring the very first recorded track by Williams, causing him to pause and say,  " This is one of the most impressive interviews I've ever experienced in my life. Seriously. "  Later in the same interview, Williams said,  " Your research is second-to-none. Second-to-none.
