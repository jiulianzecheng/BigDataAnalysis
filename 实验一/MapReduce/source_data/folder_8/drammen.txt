 '''Drammen''' is a [[cities of Norway|city]] and [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in the [[counties of Norway|county]] of [[Viken]], [[Norway]]. It has a population of 101 000 people.  
 
 Drammen was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). The rural municipality of [[Skoger]] was merged with Drammen January 1, 1964. (And then transferred from the county of [[Vestfold]] to the county of [[Buskerud]].) 
 
 Drammen is one of the larger cities in Norway, and is about 47 [[kilometre|km]] from the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Norway, [[Oslo]]. The city centre is at the end of a valley, on  both sides of the river [[Drammenselva]], and where the river meets the [[Drammensfjord]]. Drammen is also the main city for car and fruit import in Norway. 
 
 == The name == 
 The [[Old Norse language|Norse]] form of the name was ''Drafn'', and this was originally the name of the inner part of [[Drammensfjord]]. The [[fjord]] is, however, probably named after the river [[Dramselva]] (Norse ''Dröfn'').
