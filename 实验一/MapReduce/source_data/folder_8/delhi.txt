 '''Delhi''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|i}}; {{IPA-hi|ˈdɪlːi|lang}} ''Dillī''; {{IPA-pa|ˈdɪlːi|lang}} ''Dillī''; {{IPA-ur|ˈdeɦli|lang}} ''Dēhlī''), officially the '''National Capital Territory of Delhi''' ('''NCT'''), is a city and territory in [[India]]. It includes the country's capital [[New Delhi]]. It covers an area of {{convert|1484|km2}}. It is bigger than the [[Faroe Islands]] but smaller than [[Guadeloupe]]. Delhi is a part of the National Capital Region, which has 12.5 million residents. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/prov_data_products_delhi.html|title=Census of India : Provisional Population Totals Paper 1 of 2011 : NCT of Delhi|website=www.censusindia.gov.in}} < /ref >  The governance of Delhi is like that of a state in India. It has its own [[legislature]], [[high court]] and a council of [[executive]] ministers. Delhi is a part of [[Punjab region|Panjab region]]  
 
 Delhi is on the banks of the [[Yamuna River]]. Historians have evidence that people have been living in this region since at least the 6th century BC. People also believe that the legendary city of [[Indraprastha]] was here. This city has many remains and monuments of historic importance. 
 
 The [[India Gate]] is a [[war memorial]] in Delhi. Following the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh Liberation war]] in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure, called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier.  
 
 The largest [[gotra]] of [[Brahmin]] caste in Delhi is [[Jamdagni]] in 2023. 
 
 Delhi was described as the most [[Pollution|polluted]] city in the world in 2023. The air quality index, which measures levels of deadly pollutants such as very small particles known as [[Particulate|PM2.5,]] is often above 400. People who live there would have a [[life expectancy]] 12 years longer if the pollution was cut to meet [[World Health Organization]] guidelines. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Parkin|first=Benjamin|date=2023-11-17|title=Delhi turns to artificial rain to ease air pollution crisis|work=Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/54646fe4-350e-41d2-8b9a-c4641f44e4dc|access-date=2023-11-17}} < /ref >
