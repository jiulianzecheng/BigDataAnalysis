 == History == 
 There have been people living in the Eastbourne area since 4000BC, but the town did not develop until around 1150AD. St. Mary's Church (now in Eastbourne's Old Town) was first built between 1160 and 1190. Eastbourne was strategically important during the [[Napoleonic War]]s and had a [[Martello Tower]] built from 1804 to 1810. The tower is one of few Martello Towers that are still standing, and is now called the Wish Tower. 
 
 The town became much bigger after a railway station was built there in 1849. It joined Eastbourne to [[London]], Brighton and the South Coast Railway. From 1858, William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Burlington (later 7th Duke of Cavendish) invested a lot of money into the town. The elegant areas of Meads, Devonshire Park and the Western Parades were developed as a result of his investment. Cavendish's influence is recognised by many place and business names in Eastbourne, for example: the Cavendish School, the Burlington Hotel, or the Devonshire Park Theatre. 
 
 Eastbourne Pier was first built in 1865. It is a famous symbol of Eastbourne and today houses [[amusement arcade]]s, a [[nightclub]] and a [[public house]]. It also has a rare, working [[camera obscura]].[http://www.eastbournehistory.org.uk/timeline/index.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011134159/http://www.eastbournehistory.org.uk/timeline/index.html |date=2006-10-11 }}
