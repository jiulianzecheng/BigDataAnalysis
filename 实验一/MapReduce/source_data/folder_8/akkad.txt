 '''Akkad'''  or the '''Akkadian Empire''' ([[Sumer]]ian: ''Agade'', [[Bible]]: ''Accad'') was the oldest empire in history.  It was located in [[Mesopotamia]]. The Akkadian empire reached its peak during the rule of [[Sargon of Akkad]] in the 24th and 22nd centuries BCE, and it eventually collapsed in 2154 BCE. The [[ruins]] have not been found, but it is believed to be on the River [[Euphrates]]. The empire comes after a long relationship with [[Sumer]], and before the ethnic Akkadian empires of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]].  
 
 According to the Sumerian king list, Akkad (Agade) was built by [[Sargon of Akkad]], 23th century BC, and is often called the first empire in history. < ref > Liverani, Mario 1993. ''Akkad: the first world empire''. < /ref >  Even so, it is known from older [[cuneiform]] writings that the city was already there before Sargon, in the time of the kings of [[Uruk]]. According to the [[Bible]] ([[Genesis]] 10:10), it was one of the cities started by [[Nimrod]]. Also, in the earliest records, when Mesopotamian kings started calling themselves  " lord of the four quarters "  around Sumer, these were listed as: Martu, Shubar, [[Elam]], and Uri-ki.  
 
 As the [[capital city]] of the Akkadian Empire beginning with Sargon, the city ruled from around 2300 to 2215 BC, when it was destroyed by the [[Gutians]] who invaded from the mountains.  
 
 == Sargon == 
 Sargon conquered many of the surrounding regions. He created an empire which reached as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Anatolia]], and extended his rule to [[Elam]], and as far south as [[Oman]]. He ruled over this area for 56 years. Trade extended from the [[silver]] mines of Anatolia to the [[lapis lazuli]] mines in [[Afghanistan]], the [[cedar]]s of [[Lebanon]] and the [[copper]] of Oman. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production. 
 
 Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Subartu]])  were also subjugated and rebellions in Sumer were put down. [[Contract]] tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and against Sarlak, king of [[Gutium]]. 
 
 == Akkadian language == 
 The [[Akkadian language]] was one of the [[Semitic languages]], and at the time of the Akkadian Empire it was made official in both Mesopotamia and Elam. Akkadian remained the main diplomatic language of Mesopotamia for centuries. 
 
 During the [[3rd millennium BC]], an intimate cultural [[symbiosis]] developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]]. < ref name='Deutscher' > {{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: the evolution of sentential complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199532223|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}} < /ref >  [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of [[Mesopotamia]] somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), < ref name= " woods " > Woods C. 2006 “Bilingualism, scribal learning, and the death of Sumerian”.

 == Collapse of the Empire == 
 The fall of the empire established by Sargon seems to have been as sudden as its rise, and little is known about the Gutian period. From the fall of Akkad ca. 2083 BC until the Sumerian renaissance ca. 2050 BC, there is much that is still dark. It has recently been suggested that the regional decline at the end of the Akkadian period (and also in the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian Old Kingdom) was associated with rapidly increasing aridity, and failing rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Richard A.
