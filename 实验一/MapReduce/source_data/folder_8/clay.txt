 '''Clay''' is a fine-grained [[silicate mineral]] made when rocks break down. Wet clay is soft and can be shaped to make [[pottery]], [[brick]]s and other things. When it is shaped and then fired in a [[kiln]] to make it hard, it becomes pottery. 
 
 Clay often contains some water because the water molecules stick to the tiny grains. There may also be some [[Organic matter|organic]] materials in the clay. 
 
 There are 35 recognized clay [[mineral]] species on Earth, they make muds stick together ('cohesive'), or able to flow ('plastic'). The [[thixotropy]] of clay sometimes causes [[landslide]]s. 
 
 [[Quartz]], [[feldspar]]s, [[iron oxide]]s, and [[carbonate]]s can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral. < ref name= " Potter " > {{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=P.E.|last2=Maynard |first2=J.B.|last3=Depetris |first3=P.J.|title=Mud and mudstones: introduction and overview|url=https://archive.org/details/mudmudstonesintr0000pott |edition= |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |location= Wurzberg, Germany |isbn=3540221573}} < /ref >  The formation of clay is well understood.  It can come from [[soil]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[glaciation]].  Ancient mudrocks are another source, because they weather and disintegrate easily. < ref name= " Potter "  / > 
 
 Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in [[mudrock]]s. A clay particle is about 1/1000th the width of a sand grain. This means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity, thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement. < ref name= " Stow " > Stow D.A.V. 2005.
