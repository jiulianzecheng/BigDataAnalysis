 '''Prahlada''' ({{Lang-sa|प्रह्लाद|translit=Prahlāda}}), In [[Hinduism]], was a prince who was very devoted to [[Vishnu]]. His father, [[Hiranyakashipu]], was a powerful [[Asura|demon]] who wanted his son to worship him instead. But Prahlada refused, and he continued to worship Vishnu. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|last=www.wisdomlib.org|date=2013-05-29|title=Prahlada, Prahlāda, Prāhlāda: 24 definitions|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/prahlada|access-date=2022-09-10|website=www.wisdomlib.org|language=en}} < /ref > 
 Hiranyakashipu tried to kill Prahlada many times, but Vishnu always protected him. Finally, Vishnu appeared in his [[Narasimha]] [[avatar]], a half-man, half-lion form, and killed Hiranyakashipu. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
