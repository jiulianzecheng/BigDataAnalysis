 The '''Nematomorpha''' ('''horsehair worms''') are a [[phylum]] of [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[cycloneuralia]]n [[animal]]s. They look similar to [[nematode]] worms and live in similar [[environment]]s, which is why their names are similar. They are sometimes called '''Gordiacea'''. < ref > The name stems from the legendary [[Gordian knot]], because nematomorphs often tie themselves in knots. Piper, Ross 2007. ''Extraordinary animals: an encyclopedia of curious and unusual animals'', Greenwood Press. < /ref > 
 
 They range in size from {{convert|50|to|100|cm|in}} long and in extreme cases may be up to 2 meters long. They are {{convert|1|to|3|mm}} in [[diameter]]. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, streams, puddles, and [[cistern]]s.  
 
 About 326 species are known and an estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 species worldwide. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Global diversity of hairworms (Nematomorpha: Gordiaceae) in freshwater|author=Poinar Jr., G|journal=Hydrobiologia|volume=595|issue=1|year=2008|pages=79–83|doi=10.1007/s10750-007-9112-3|s2cid=37985613}} < /ref >

 ==Life cycle== 
 The adult worms are free living and, in North America, are usually found only in the summer months in or near shallow water. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Seasonal occurrence, morphology, and observations on the life history of ''Gordius difficilis'' (Nematomorpha: Gordioidea) from Southeastern Wisconsin, United States|author=Bolek M.G. and Coggins J.R. |journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=88|year=2002|issue=2 |pages=287–294|doi=10.1645/0022-3395(2002)088[0287:SOMAOO]2.0.CO;2 |pmid=12053999 |s2cid=18267925 }} < /ref > 
 
 The [[larva]]e are [[parasite|parasitic]] on [[arthropods]]: [[beetle]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[grasshoppers]] and [[crickets]]. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Biology of the phylum Nematomorpha|author=Hanelt B; Thomas F and Schmidt-Rhaesa A.|journal=Advances in Parasitology|volume=59|year=2005|pages=244–305|doi=10.1016/S0065-308X(05)59004-3|pmid=16182867|isbn=9780120317592}} < /ref >  These are their final hosts, but since they do not live in water, the nematomorph life cycle has an extra stage.  
 
 A day or two after they come out of their hosts, the adult worms mate in the water, and then around mid-August or Mid-October, they lay their eggs in the water. It takes about a month for the [[larvae]] to develop inside the egg. Once the larvae hatch, they somehow get into [[gastropod]]s (like snails and slugs), [[insect]]s, or [[earthworm]]s, which live in moist [[habitat]]s. There they build a [[cyst]], and grow. The animal they grow inside is called an interim (temporary) host, because a final host is still needed. 
 
 Next, developing nematomorph worms can be found in their final hosts (beetles, etc.). It is not clear how they get there, but probably the final host eats the interim host with the larvae inside them. After they appear in the final host, the nematomorphs begin to eat it from the inside. 
 
 The nematomorph may control the host, leading it towards water and even causing it to jump into the water. < ref > http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C14FA3E550C758CDDA00894DD404482{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Then it breaks out of the beetle in or near the water and finds a knot of other worms. There it can mate.
