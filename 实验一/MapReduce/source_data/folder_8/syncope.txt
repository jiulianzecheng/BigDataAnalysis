 '''Syncope''' is the [[medicine|medical]] term for '''fainting''' or '''blacking out'''. It is a sudden loss of [[consciousness]], usually for a short time. It is mostly because there is not enough [[oxygen]] in the [[brain]]. It can be for other reasons.  
 
 Fainting is quite common. It usually happens in two age ranges: the teenage years, and during older age. The chance of a person fainting at least once in a lifetime is about 40 to 50 percent. Syncope causes 1 to 3 percent of all attendances to emergency departments and 1 to 6 percent of all hospital admissions. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Ruwald M.H. ''et al'' 2012.
