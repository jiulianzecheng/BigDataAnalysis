The terms '''commoners''', '''common people''' or the '''masses''' refers to ordinary people who are members of neither the [[nobility]] nor the [[Clergy|priesthood]]. In a system of [[social class]]es, they are those without title or rank. Since the [[20th century]], the term ''common people'' has been used in its place. It refers to typical members of society in contrast to those who are highly privileged (in either wealth or influence). 
 
 ==History== 
 In Europe, a concept of common people started in the [[classical antiquity]] of [[ancient Rome]] around the 6th century BC. The Roman social division was into [[patrician]]s (nobles) and [[plebeian]]s (commoners). The division may have been instituted by King Servius Tullius as an alternative to the previous three noble [[tribe]] < nowiki/ > s or clans, whose divisions had caused conflict. < ref name =  " class " > {{Cite book

 The [[ancient Greeks]] generally had no concept of [[Social class|class]] and their leading social divisions were simply non-Greeks, free-Greeks and slaves. < ref > Plato, ''The Republic'', Part I, book IV < /ref >  With the growth of [[Christianity]] in the [[4th century]] [[AD]], a new world view arose in [[Europe]]an thinking about social division, which continued until at least early modern times. < ref name= " class "  / > 
 
 [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] stated that social division was a result of the [[Fall of Man]]. < ref name= " class "  / >  The three leading divisions were considered to be the priesthood ([[clergy]]), the nobility, and the common people. That would sometimes be expressed as  " those who prayed " ,  " those who fought "  and  " those who worked " . The [[Latin]] terms for the three classes (''oratores'', ''bellatores'' and ''laboratores'') are often found even in modern textbooks, and have been used in sources since the 9th century. < ref > {{cite web|url= http://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/westciv/medsoc/03.shtml|title= The Three Orders|publisher= [[Boise State University]]|access-date= 2013-01-31|archive-date= 2014-04-07|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140407061047/http://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/westciv/medsoc/03.shtml|url-status= dead}} < /ref >
