 ''This article is about the structural behavior.  For other meanings see [[Bending (disambiguation)]].'' 
 
 In [[engineering]] and [[mechanics]], '''bending''' (also known as '''flexure''') characterizes the behavior of a structural [[wikt:element|element]] subjected to a lateral [[load]] (i.e. at right angles to its length).   
 
 A structural element subjected to bending is known as a [[Beam (structure)|beam]]. Stiffness is its ability to resist bending. 
 
 A [[closet]] rod sagging under the weight of clothes is an example of a beam experiencing bending.
