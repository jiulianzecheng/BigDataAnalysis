 An '''insectivore''' is an [[animal]] or [[insect]] that eats mostly [[Insect|insects]] for [[food]]. An [[anteater]] is an animal that eats [[ant]]s. [[Insectivorous plant|Insectivorous plants]] also eat [[Insect|insects]]. The [[Venus flytrap]] is one of them. 
 
 To eat insects for food is not very easy because insects are small. Large insect-eating animals must eat many of them. Anteaters eat hundreds of ants every day. 
 
 Some [[omnivore]]s like [[human]]s and [[bear]]s also eat [[Insect|insects]] for food. There was once a taxonomic group of mammals called Insectivora. Most of its animals are now called [[Eulipotyphla]].
