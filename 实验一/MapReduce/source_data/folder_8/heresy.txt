 '''Heresy''' is a word used by different [[religion|religious]] groups, used to describe someone who has [[idea]]s that are different from what the religion or law teaches. Such a person is known as '''heretic'''.  
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]] it was not uncommon to accuse someone of heresy. If the accusations could be proven, the culprit would go through a [[ritual]]. Since [[torture]] could be used, the accusations were often proven. The ritual was done to save the [[soul]] of the convicted criminal.  It involved being burnt while tied to a post. 
 
 Still in the 21st century Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|apostatize]] are often treated very harshly and frequently killed. 
 
 [[Jesus Christ]] himself was regarded as a [[blasphemy|heretic]] by the [[Jewish]] leaders at the time- see [[Gospel of Matthew]] 26:57-67 
 
 The Roman Catholic Church in early times had great trouble with heretical christological doctrines, such as [[Monophysitism]] and [[Arianism]]. The Church sees several heresies in [[Protestantism]]: 
 *Protestants claim only [[scripture]] (the [[Bible]]) is relevant for the faith (''sola scriptura''); the Catholic Church says traditions are also important. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 82-83}} < /ref >   
 *Protestants say that belief is enough to be saved (''sola fide''). Catholics say that good deeds are necessary as well. 
 *Protestants say that [[Universal priesthood (doctrine)|anyone can be a priest]]; the only requirement is that the person is [[baptism|baptised]]. In the Catholic and Orthodox churches, priests are ordained. This means that some people are not priests, even though they have been baptised. 
 *According to Protestants, there is no [[Transubstantiation]] during [[mass (liturgy)]].  
 *The [[Canon Missae|Roman Missal]] contains heresies, according to Protestants 
 
 As a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] was created in the Roman Catholic Church which protects the Church against heresies. It is the last instance to decide what constitutes a heresy, and how to deal with it.
