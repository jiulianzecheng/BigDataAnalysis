'''[[Negombo]]''' ({{lang-ta|நீர்கொழும்பு}}, {{lang-si|මීගමුව}})is a city north of [[Colombo]] on the west coast of [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Bandranaike International Airport]] is here. Near the waterfront, the remains of a 17th-century Dutch fort now contains a prison. Negombo Lagoon, lined with fishermen's huts, feeds into the Dutch-era [[Hamilton Canal]]. The canal leads south to Colombo. The [[neoclassical]] St Mary's church, completed in the 1920s, has a ceiling decorated with vivid religious paintings.
