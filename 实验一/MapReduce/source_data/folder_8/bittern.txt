 '''Bitterns''' are waterbirds, living mostly in freshwater sites. They are a type of [[heron]], wading birds in the family Ardeidae. They are shorter-necked, and more secretive than other herons.  Most of them have good [[camouflage]] amongst the [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] where they make their nests. 
 
 Bitterns form a [[monophyletic]] subfamily of the herons, the Botaurinae. 
 
 Bitterns usually frequent reedbeds and similar [[marsh]]y areas, and feed on [[amphibia]]ns, [[reptile]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[fish]]. Unlike the similar [[stork]]s, [[ibis]]es, and [[spoonbill]]s, herons and bitterns fly with their necks retracted, not outstretched. 
 
 They were called ''hæferblæte'' in [[Old English language|Old English]]; the word  " bittern "  came to [[English language|English]] from Old French. < ref > ''butor'', itself from Gallo-roman ''butitaurus'', a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of [[Latin]] ''būtiō'' and ''taurus''. {{cite encyclopedia | editor = Joseph P.

 Bitterns are in three [[genera]]. The genus ''[[Ixobrychus]]'' contains mainly small species. The genus ''[[Botaurus]]'' has the larger bitterns. There is a single species in a third genus, ''[[Zebrilus]]''. The distribution of bitterns is pretty much worldwide. < ref > Hancock J.A. 1999.
