 [[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the land owned by Babylon when Hammurabi became king c. 1792 BC (red), and when he died c. 1750 BC (orange)]] 
 Hammurabi became king of Babylon in around 1792 BC, when his father Sin-Muballit abdicated. < ref > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p= 1}} < /ref >  Babylon was one of many small independent cities in ancient Mesopotamia. < ref > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1–2}} < /ref >  These cities often fought each other for control of land. Babylon was already one of the more powerful cities when Hammurabi became king. Earlier kings of Babylon had taken over the nearby [[city-state]]s of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar. < ref name= " VM3 " > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}} < /ref >   
 
 Hammurabi did not fight any important wars in the early part of his [[reign]]. He instead improved the buildings of Babylon. He built taller city walls to make the city more difficult to attack, and expanded the temples. < ref > {{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=43}} < /ref >  In around 1771 BC, the kingdom of [[Elam]] attacked Mesopotamia from the east. < ref > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=15–16}} < /ref >  Elam invaded Eshnunna, a city-state to the north-east of Babylon, and destroyed its cities. < ref > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=17}} < /ref >  It also tried to start a war between Babylon and Larsa, a city in southern Mesopotamia. However, Hammurabi instead made an [[alliance]] with Larsa against Elam. < ref name= " VM18 " > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=18}} < /ref >  Hammurabi defeated Elam, but felt that Larsa had not given him enough help. He therefore attacked Larsa. Babylon had entirely conquered southern Mesopotamia by c. 1763 BC. < ref name= " VM31 " > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=31}} < /ref > 
 
 Hammurabi's allies in northern Mesopotamia had sent their armies to the south to help Babylon. This caused unrest in the northern area. < ref name= " VM31 " / >   Hammurabi therefore returned north, stopping the unrest, and defeating Eshnunna. < ref > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=40–41}} < /ref >  He then attacked and conquered the remaining cities in northern Mesopotamia, including Babylon's former ally Mari. It is possible that Mari surrendered to Babylon without any fighting happening. < ref > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=54–55}} < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp= 64–65}} < /ref >  After this, Hammurabi was in control of most of Mesopotamia. Only [[Aleppo]] and [[Qatna]], two western cities in modern [[Syria]] remained independent. < ref name= " Ar45 " > {{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=45}} < /ref >  When Hammurabi died in c. 1750 BC, his son [[Samsu-iluna]] became king. < ref > {{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=42}} < /ref >
