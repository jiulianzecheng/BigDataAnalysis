 '''Joggins''', [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], is famous for its [[fossils]] dating to the [[Pennsylvanian]] 'Coal Age' of Earth history. < ref > Falcon-Lang H.J. ''et al.'' 2010.

''Geology Today'' '''26''' (3): 108-114. < /ref >  On July 7, 2008 a 15 & nbsp;km length of the coast comprising the Joggins Fossil Cliffs was officially inscribed on the World Heritage List. < ref name= " UNESCO portal " > {{Cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D43039%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |title=UNESCO portal |access-date=2020-09-15 |archive-date=2010-01-05 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mYMVYuEy?url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=43039 |url-status=bot: unknown }} < /ref >

 ==Joggins Fossil Cliffs== 
 The dramatic coastal exposure of the Coal Age rocks, known as the '''Joggins Fossil Cliffs''', are continually hewn and freshly exposed by the actions of the tides in the Cumberland Basin. Geologists were first attracted to this [[wikt:locality|locality]] in the late 1820s. < ref name= " pennsylvanian " > Falcon-Lang H.J. 2006. A history of research at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs, the world’s finest Pennsylvanian section. ''Proceedings of the Geologists’ Association'' '''117'''(3): 377-392 < /ref >  A little later, the first student party studied Joggins in 1835 < ref > Falcon-Lang H.J. 2009. The 1835 Williams College expedition to Atlantic Canada: The first geological fieldtrip by a North American college. ''Atlantic Geology'' '''45''':95–109 < /ref > 
 
 However, the true fame of Joggins dates from the visits in 1842 and 1852 by [[Charles Lyell]], the founder of modern geology and author of ''[[Principles of Geology]]''. In his ''Elements of Geology'' (1871), Lyell called the Joggins exposure of Coal Age rocks and fossils  " the finest example in the world " . < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://jogginsfossilcliffs.net/ |title=Joggins Fossil Cliffs website |access-date=2011-09-27 |archive-date=2010-01-05 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mYMVXLGU?url=http://jogginsfossilcliffs.net/ |url-status=bot: unknown }} < /ref >  The fossil record at Joggins figures in Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', and played a role in the 1860 Oxford evolution debate between [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Samuel Wilberforce|Bishop Wilberforce]]. 
 : " Mssrs. Lyell and Dawson found carboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than 68 different levels... "  Charles Darwin 1859. ''On the Origin of Species'', p296. 
 
 Much of the early work to document the fossil record at Joggins was by Nova Scotian geologist [[John William Dawson|William Dawson]] (1820–1899), who had a close personal and working relationship with his friend and [[wikt:mentor|mentor]] Charles Lyell. Much of Dawson's collection is in the Redpath Museum of [[McGill University]].

 In 1852 Lyell and Dawson made a celebrated discovery of [[tetrapod]] fossils entombed within an upright tree at Coal Mine Point. Subsequent investigations by Dawson led to the discovery of one of the most important fossils in the history of science, [[Hylonomus|''Hylonomus lyelli'']], which remains the earliest known reptile in the history of life, but not the earliest known [[amniote]]. In 2002, ''Hylonomus lyelli'' was named the provincial fossil of Nova Scotia. 
 
 [[Trackway]]s are preserved at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs. The tree-like [[lycopod]] ''[[Sigillaria]]'' is preserved ''[[List of Latin phrases (I)|in situ]]''. 
 
 == Recent work == 
 There has been a surge in interest in Joggins over the past 20 years. < ref name= " pennsylvanian "  / >  A thesis by Mike Rygel significantly advanced understanding of the site's history, [[stratigraphy]], [[sedimentology]] and [[biota]] after the century of neglect which followed Dawson's death in 1899. < ref name= " pennsylvanian "  / > 
 
 === Important fossil === 
 A vital early tetrapod fossil has been found here, the earliest [[synapsid]], ''[[Protoclepsydrops]]'', which is actually earlier than ''[[Hylonomus]]''. < ref name=B & D/ > 
 
 ==World Heritage Site== 
 In 2007, a 15 & nbsp;km length of the coast comprising the Joggins Fossil Cliffs was nominated by Canada to [[UNESCO]] as a natural [[World Heritage Site]]. It was officially inscribed on the World Heritage List in on July 7, 2008. < ref name= " UNESCO portal " / >
