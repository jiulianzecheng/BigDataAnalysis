 The '''Mollicutes''' are a class of [[bacteria]] with no bacterial [[cell wall]]. < ref > The word  " Mollicutes "  is derived from the Latin ''mollis'' (meaning  " soft "  or  " pliable " ), and ''cutis'' (meaning  " skin " ). < /ref > < ref > ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''.  Mollicutes.  [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/388373/Mollicutes] < /ref >  ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' is the best-known [[genus]]. 
 
 They are very small, only about 0.2–0.3 μm in size, and have a very small [[genome]]. Most move about by [[gliding]] across host cells, but ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' are [[helix|helical]] and move by twisting.  
 
 Mollicutes are [[parasites]] of various animals and plants, living on or in the host's cells. Many cause diseases in humans. ''Mycoplasma'' and ''[[Ureaplasma]]'' stick to cells in the [[lungs]] or sex tubes like the [[urethra]].  ''[[Phytoplasma]]'' and ''Spiroplasma'' are plant [[pathogens]] with [[insect]] [[vectors]]. Bugs such as [[leaf-hoppers]] ([[Homoptera]]) are the vectors. They deliver the parasites when they stick their mouth-parts into a plant to suck its [[sap]].
