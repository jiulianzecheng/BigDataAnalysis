 '''Arteriosclerosis''' is a diseased condition of the [[arteries]]. The artery walls are thickened, hardened and lose stretchiness, called elasticity. 
 
 There are three main types: < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=%2Fppdocs%2Fus%2Fcommon%2Fdorlands%2Fdorland%2Fone%2F000008408.htm |title=''Dorlands Medical Dictionary'' |access-date=2009-07-31 |archive-date=2009-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731103315/http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=%2Fppdocs%2Fus%2Fcommon%2Fdorlands%2Fdorland%2Fone%2F000008408.htm |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 *'''Atherosclerosis''' is the most common type. It is the narrowing of arteries from a buildup of [[plaque]], usually made up of [[cholesterol]], fatty substances, cellular waste products, [[calcium]] and fibrin, inside the arteries. This affects large and medium-sized arteries; however, its positioning varies person to person. < ref > {{Cite web|title = Atherosclerosis: MedlinePlus|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/atherosclerosis.html|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2015-06-19}} < /ref >   
 *'''MÃ¶nckeberg Arteriosclerosis'''. This is when the middle layer of the artery stiffens. This is because of [[calcium]] deposits.  
 *'''Arteriolosclerosis'''. This affects the body's smaller arteries. < ref > " Arteriosclerosis " . World Book Advanced. World Book, 2016. Web. 22 Feb. 2016. < /ref > 
 
 The effects of arteriosclerosis can lead to lack of regular blood flow. Low blood flow to the brain can make you dizzy, numb, have slurred speech, and have other symptoms. Thromboses can further block the blood flow. This causes you to be at risk of getting [[stroke]], or a [[heart attack]]. 
 
 Arteriosclerosis is a major health problem. Arteriosclerosis can be prevented by reducing risks. Risks are [[Tobacco|smoking]], [[obesity]], and low amounts of exercise. Doctors recommend dieting and exercise. Diets that are low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Some patients may take [[Statin|drugs that lower the amount]] of [[cholesterol]] in their blood. < ref > Insel P.M. and Roth W.T. 2003. Cardiovascular disease and Cancer.
