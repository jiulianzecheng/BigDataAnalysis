 Male [[mammal]]s have a [[penis]], and a [[glans penis]]. Usually, some skin covers the glans penis. This skin is called '''foreskin'''. Most [[male]] [[mammals]] either have a foreskin that covers the glans penis or a sheath in which the whole penis can retract. 
 
 [[Circumcision]] is the removal or shortening of this skin. It is often done for religious reasons. Sometimes it is done for medical reasons. 
 
 Female mammals have a [[clitoris]]. It also has a piece of skin protecting it, called [[clitoral hood]]. 
 
 ==Human foreskin== 
 The outside of the foreskin is like normal skin but the inside of the foreskin is a [[membrane]] like the inside of an [[eyelid]] or  [[mouth]]. The foreskin is attached to the penis by the [[frenulum]], but it can move. It is very [[elastic|stretchy]]. < ref name= " lakshmanan " > {{cite journal |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/lakshmanan/ |title=Human prepuce - structure  &  function |first1=S |last1=Lakshmanan |last2=Prakash|first2= S |journal=Indian J Surg |year=1980 |volume=44 |pages=134–7}} < /ref >  On the penis, the most [[nerve|sensitive]] areas to fine-touch are located on the foreskin. < ref > {{cite journal |url=http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/sorrells_2007.pdf |title=Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis |authors=Sorrels Morris, James L.

 ==Retractability== 
 [[File:Foreskin retraction manually.ogv|thumb|An uncircumcised adult male shows how the foreskin can slide back and forth over the glans of the penis.]] 
 [[File:Penis erection forskin.jpg|thumb|Although this penis is erect (hard), the foreskin is over the glans (end of the penis.) Usually, the foreskin retracts when a penis becomes erect.]] 
 
 In older boys and adult males, the foreskin can be pulled back. In baby boys, the foreskin is usually attached to the glans of the penis and should not be forcibly pushed or pulled back for cleaning. In the United States, medical advice is usually that parents should gently pull back their son's foreskin part way back for cleaning after the baby is one year old. < ref > {{cite web |title=Foreskin Care Questions |url=https://www.seattlechildrens.org/conditions/a-z/foreskin-care-questions/ |website=Seattle Children’s Hospital |accessdate=3 August 2023 |language=en}} < /ref >  [[Soap]] should not be used -- just warm water.

 American doctors may be more worried about possible [[kidney]] damage, especially scarring inside the kidneys. That can happen because of a bacterial infection that starts in the foreskin and [[urethra]]. The urethra is the tube urine (pee) comes out of. The infection often spreads to the [[bladder]]. While not as common, the infection can spread further to the kidneys. A serious kidney infection (called [[pyelonephritis]]) can cause scarring of the kidney. The boy may have very serious kidney problems and may even die because of a childhood [[urinary tract infection]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Pyelonephritis |url=https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/conditions/pyelonephritis |website=www.nationwidechildrens.org |accessdate=4 August 2023 |language=en}} < /ref >  Acute (very serious) pyelonephritis in the first years of life often leads to significant renal (kidney) damage that may progress to end-stage renal disease during [[adolescence]]. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=J.

If the person does not receive frequent kidney [[dialysis]] or a kidney [[Transplant (surgery)|transplant]], the person will die.  
 
 European doctors may think it is more important that parents not touch their young boy's penis too much. The European attitude is that a boy should discover how to pull back his foreskin on his own. < ref > {{cite web |title=Foreskin Care Questions |url=https://www.seattlechildrens.org/conditions/a-z/foreskin-care-questions/ |website=Seattle Children’s Hospital |accessdate=3 August 2023 |language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 In any case, sometime between infancy and the onset of [[puberty]], the foreskin separates from the glans of the penis and can slide back and forth over the glans of the penis. Often this happens sometime after age five. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Philadelphia |first1=The Children's Hospital of |title=Care of the Uncircumcised Penis |url=https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/care-uncircumcised-penis |website=www.chop.edu |accessdate=14 July 2023 |language=en |date=23 August 2014}} < /ref >  This happens because of normal [[Erection|erections]] during childhood.

Alternatively, a male (or his sexual partner) may slide the foreskin back and forth over the glans of the penis to cause an erection.  
 
 For a few boys, the foreskin does not separate on its own from the glans of the penis. In the few cases where a boy can't pull his foreskin all the way back by puberty, the boy should ask a doctor or nurse. < ref > {{cite web |title=Learning About How to Care for an Uncircumcised Penis |url=https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/aftercareinformation/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=abo1357 |website=myhealth.alberta.ca |accessdate=3 August 2023}} < /ref >  Usually a doctor will correct the problem or give advice about how to gradually stretch the foreskin. The doctor may give a [[prescription]] for a [[steroid]] cream which will help to stretch the skin. < ref > {{cite web |title=What are the treatment options for phimosis? |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326433/ |website=InformedHealth.org [Internet] |publisher=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) |accessdate=3 August 2023 |language=en |date=31 October 2018 |quote=Use a steroid cream to help stretch the foreskin.}} < /ref >  Circumcision is another common option, especially in the United States. 
 
 ==Sensitivity in humans== 
 The foreskin contains Meissner’s corpuscles, which are nerve endings involved in fine-touch sensitivity. They are most numerous in the “ridged band”, the junction of the inner and outer foreskin layers, and least numerous in the smooth inner layer of foreskin. Compared to other hairless skin areas on the body, the Meissner's index was highest in the finger tip (0.96) and lowest in the foreskin (0.28). The foreskin is the least sensitive hairless tissue of the body. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Guy|last2=Krieger|first2=John N.|last3=Morris|first3=Brian J.|date=June 2015|title=Histological Correlates of Penile Sexual Sensation: Does Circumcision Make a Difference?|journal=Sexual Medicine|volume=3|issue=2|pages=76–85|doi=10.1002/sm2.67|issn=2050-1161|pmc=4498824|pmid=26185672}} < /ref >  A study also found that “the number of these nerve endings decreases significantly after the teenage to young adult years when sexual activity begins. This makes it very difficult to propose any sexual function for Meissner’s corpuscles. A more feasible hypothesis is to regard them as a juvenile phenomenon, perhaps serving to protect the penis until the onset of puberty reveals its sexual function.” < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Studies in sexual sensation concluded that the glans, not the foreskin, is involved in sexual sensation, particularly the corona and frenular (the area under the frenulum) areas. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Thus, speculation and outdated opinion pieces claiming special properties of the foreskin, such as in penile function and masturbation, should be viewed with skepticism. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Brian J.|last2=Krieger|first2=John N.|last3=Klausner|first3=Jeffrey D.|date=2017-03-24|title=CDC's Male Circumcision Recommendations Represent a Key Public Health Measure|url=http://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15|journal=Global Health: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=15–27|doi=10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00390|issn=2169-575X|pmc=5478224|pmid=28351877}} < /ref > 
 
 Perhaps sensitivity of the foreskin to fine touch might have served as an “early warning system” in our naked upright forebears from the intrusion of biting insects and parasites while protecting the glans. < ref name= " :2 " > Darwin C.
