 '''Pewter''' is an [[alloy]] made of [[tin]] mixed with [[antimony]] and [[copper]]. It is soft and flexible and it can be melted easily. It dissolves in [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce [[tin(II) chloride]], leaving the [[antimony]] and [[copper]] behind in the hydrochloric acid. In the past, it was used to make knives, forks, spoons and other pieces of cutlery because it was easy to melt down many times. It used to contain [[poison]]ous [[lead]], but it does not contain lead anymore as the lead would make people ill when making things with pewter.
