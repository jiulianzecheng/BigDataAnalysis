 '''''Marrella splendens''''' is an [[arthropod]] known from the middle [[Cambrian]] [[Burgess Shale]] of [[British Columbia]].  It is the most common animal in the Burgess Shale. 
 
 ==History== 
 ''Marrella'' was the first fossil collected by [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]] from the Burgess Shale, in 1909. < ref > {{cite book|last= Gould|first= Stephen Jay|authorlink= Stephen Jay Gould|title= Wonderful Life: Burgess Shale and the Nature of History|publisher= Vintage|year= 2000|page=108|isbn= 978-0-09-927345-5|oclc= 45316756|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SjpSkzjIzfsC & pg=PA108}} Also {{OCLC|44058853}}. < /ref >  Walcott described ''Marrella'' informally as a  " lace crab "  and described it more formally as an odd [[Trilobita|trilobite]]. In 1971, [[Harry B. Whittington|Whittington]] did a thorough redescription of the animal. On the basis of its legs, [[gill]]s and head appendages, he decided that it was not a trilobite, nor a [[Chelicerata|chelicerate]], nor a [[crustacean]]. < ref name= " Whittington1971 " > {{cite journal|last= Whittington|first= H.

 ''Marrella''-like organisms are found in other Cambrian deposits. They are known from sediments as late as the [[Devonian]]. < ref name=Siveter2007 > {{Cite journal |last=Siveter D.J.
