 The family of [[rodent]]s that include [[kangaroo rat]]s, [[kangaroo mouse|kangaroo mice]] and [[pocket mouse|rock pocket mice]] is the '''Heteromyidae''' family. Most '''heteromyids''' live in complex burrows in the [[desert]]s and [[grassland]]s of western [[North America]]. Some species within the ''[[Heteromys]]'' and ''[[Liomys]]'' [[genus|genera]] are also found in [[forest]]s and can be found down as far as northern [[South America]]. They feed mostly on [[seed]]s and other plant parts, which they carry in their cheek pouches to their burrows. 
 
 Although they are very different in physical appearance, the closest relatives of the heteromyids are [[pocket gopher]]s in the Geomyidae family.
