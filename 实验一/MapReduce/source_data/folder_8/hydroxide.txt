 '''Hydroxide''' in [[chemistry]] is a name given to the [[diatomic]] [[anion]] OH < sup > âˆ’ < /sup > , made up of [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s. Most [[chemical compounds]] that contain hydroxides are [[base (chemistry)|bases]]. 
 
 An [[Arrhenius base]] is a substance that when [[solvation|dissolved]] in an [[aqueous solution]], it produces hydroxide [[ion]]s. Therefore, hydroxide ions are heavily involved in [[acid-base]] reactions. 
 
 Many useful chemical reactions or processes involve hydroxide or hydroxide ions. [[Sodium hydroxide]] is used in industry as a strong base, [[potassium hydroxide]] is used in [[agriculture]], and [[iron hydroxide]] minerals such as [[goethite]] and [[limonite]] have been used as iron [[ore]]. The [[aluminium]] ore [[bauxite]] is made mainly out of aluminium hydroxides. 
 
 Most inorganic hydroxide salts do not dissolve in water. 
 
 == Uses of hydroxides == 
 Many useful [[chemical]]s and chemical processes involve hydroxides or hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is used in factories as an [[alkali]], potassium hydroxide is used in farming, and iron hydroxide has been used as low grade brown iron ore. 
 
 ==Examples of hydroxides== 
 *[[Sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) 
 *[[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) 
 *[[Calcium hydroxide]] (Ca(OH) < sub > 2 < /sub > ) 
 *[[Ammonium hydroxide]] (NH < sub > 4 < /sub > OH)
