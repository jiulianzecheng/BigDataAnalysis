An '''aneurysm''' (or '''aneurism''') is a [[blood]]-filled bulge of a [[blood vessel]]. It is usually caused by [[disease]] or by the walls of the blood vessel becoming weak. Aneurysms usually happen in [[artery|arteries]] at the base of the [[brain]] and in the [[aorta]] (the main artery coming out of the [[heart]]) - this is an [[aortic aneurysm]]. This bulge in a blood vessel can burst or break open and cause the person to die at any time. The larger an aneurysm becomes, the more likely it is to burst. However, aneurysms can be treated. A common way to treat aneurysms are to clip the bulge at its connection to the vein, so that if and when the bulge ruptures, the blood vessel will remain functional. Microsurgery and Vascular grafting are also viable options with high success rates.
