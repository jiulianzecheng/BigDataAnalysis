 '''Larderello''' is a ''[[frazione]]'' of the ''comune'' of [[Pomarance]], in [[Tuscany]] in central [[Italy]]. Larderello is famous for its [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] productivity. 
 
 == History == 
 The region was known from ancient times for its [[volcano|volcanic]] nature and for the very hot springs. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used its [[sulphur]] springs for bathing. In 1827, [[Fran√ßois de Larderel]], a [[French people|Frenchman]], invented a way of extracting [[boric acid]] from the volcanic mud by using steam to separate the two. The town Larderello has the name in honour of Larderel's work. < ref > http://www.edf.fr/html/en/decouvertes/voyage/renouvenables/geothermie/geothermie-01.html < /ref >  The region was the site of a pioneering experiment in the production of energy from geothermal sources in 1904. Prince [[Piero Ginori Conti]] tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the Larderello dry steam field in Italy. It was a small generator that lit four light bulbs. < ref > Tiwari, G. N.; Ghosal, M. K. ''Renewable Energy Resources: Basic Principles and Applications.'' Alpha Science Int'l Ltd., 2005 {{ISBN|1-84265-125-0}} < /ref >  Later, in 1911, the world's first geothermal power plant was built there. In 1911, the world's first geothermal power plant was built in the Valle del Diavolo ( " Devil's Valley " ), named for the boiling water in the area. Larderello now produces 10% of the world's entire supply of geothermal electricity, amounting to 4,800 [[GWh]] per year.
