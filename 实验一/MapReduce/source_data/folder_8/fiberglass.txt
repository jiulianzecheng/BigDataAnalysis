 '''Fiberglass''' (also called '''fibreglass''' and '''glass fibre''') is material made from extremely fine [[fiber]]s of [[glass]].   
 
 It is used as a reinforcing material for many [[polymer]] products. The [[composite material]], that is produced by this method is called  " fiberglass "  in popular usage. The proper names are [[fiber-reinforced polymer]] (FRP) or [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP). 
 
 Glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass manufacture of fiberglass was only made possible when finer tools for machines were produced. The first major use was in  " glass wool "  for [[insulation]], starting in the 1930s.   
 
 Glass fiber is formed when [[silica]]-based or other formulation glass is [[extrusion|extruded]] into many fibers with small [[diameter]]s that are suitable for [[textile]] processing.  Glass is unlike other [[polymer]]s because, even as a fiber, it has little [[crystal]]line structure (see [[amorphous solid]]).  The properties of the structure of glass in its soft stage are very much like its properties when spun into fiber.   
 
 == Safety == 
 Bare fiberglass can cause skin irritation and cuts when handled without gloves. There have been concerns that fiberglass can be accidentally inhaled into the lungs, where it might cause [[cancer]] and other lung problems, similar to [[asbestos]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ejnet.org/rachel/rehw444.htm|title=RACHEL #444: FIBER GLASS: A CARCINOGEN THAT'S EVERYWHERE|website=www.ejnet.org}} < /ref >  Fiberglass has been called  " [[Artificial|man-made]] asbestos " . Substitutes for fiberglass building insulation, such as [[cellulose]] and [[aerogel]], have started to appear.
