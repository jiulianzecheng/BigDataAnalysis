 An''' empire''' is a set of lands, regions or [[Country|countries]] that are ruled by an [[Emperor]]. An empire usually also has many different [[culture]]s. In history, many empires were usually formed when a country began to [[Invasion|invade]] or [[Colonialism|colonise]] nearby countries.  
 
 Usually, an empire is ruled by one dominant country.  For example, the [[British Empire]] was largely controlled by the [[United Kingdom]]'s government. 
 
 Well-known empires include the [[Persian Empire]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Russian Empire]], Greek [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[British Empire]]. 
 
 Sea empires grew mostly by sailing to distant places and conquering them. The [[Aztec Empire]] and the [[Mongol Empire]] were land empires. The [[Venice|Venetian]] Empire and the British Empire were sea empires. The largest empire was The British Empire. 
 
 Before [[Christopher Columbus]], there were several American empires including [[Vikings]] (owned [[Greenland]]), the [[Aztec Empire]], and the [[Inca Empire]]. The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were the first [[Europe]]ans to discover [[Americas|America]]. Later came the [[England|English]], later to be called the [[British Empire]] controlled most of [[North America]], and the [[Spanish Empire]] controlled most of [[South America]] and [[Latin America]]. 
 
 The oldest empire was the [[Akkadian Empire]], whose founder was [[Sargon of Akkad]].
