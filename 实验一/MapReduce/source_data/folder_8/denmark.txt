 '''Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Danmark}}), officially named the '''Kingdom of Denmark''', is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]] in [[Northern Europe]]. It is the furthest south of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, to the south of Norway and south-west of Sweden (which it is connected to by a bridge). It has a south border with [[Germany]]. It borders both the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the east. Denmark is a [[developed country]] with a large [[welfare state]]; < ref name= " Esping-Andersen " > Esping-Andersen, G. (1990). ''The three worlds of welfare capitalism''. Princeton University Press. < /ref >  In 2006 and 2007, surveys < ref > {{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=4086092 & page=1|title=Great Danes: The Geography of Happiness|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=8 January 2009|website=ABC News}} < /ref >  ranked Denmark as  " the happiest place in the world, "  based on standards of health, [[welfare]], and [[education]]. 
 
 The origin of the name Denmark ({{lang-da|Danmark}}) is uncertain. In [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], the country was called Danmǫrk, referring to the Danish March (the marches of the Danes). 
 
 The [[capital city]] of Denmark is [[Copenhagen]], on the island of Zealand. Denmark is a [[constitutional monarchy]] (meaning the [[head of state]] is a monarch who has few established powers) with a queen, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Denmark is a parliamentary state, meaning the people appoint a [[parliament]] to make decisions for them, and it has a [[democracy|democratic government]] headed by an elected Prime Minister, who currently is [[Mette Frederiksen]] since 2019. 
 
 == History == 
 Denmark was first united in the [[10th century]], during the [[Viking]] period, by king [[Harald Bluetooth]] ({{circa|985}}), who first converted Denmark to [[Christianity]]. The Vikings are well known for invading countries. In the [[11th century]], the Danish Vikings controlled [[England]] (the [[Danelaw]]) for a while. In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the ''Kalmar Union'') Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called ''Denmark-Norway)'' stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], including the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. Iceland became [[independent]] from Denmark in 1944. 
 
 [[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting to write the constitution, 1848.]] 
 Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on June 5, 1849 when it adopted a [[constitution]] which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people. June 5 is now a holiday in Denmark, called  " Constitution Day " . 
 
 Over the years Denmark lost many of the lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the ''Second Schleswig War'' (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were conquered by the Kingdom [[Prussia]] (now a part of [[Germany]]). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]ity after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the [[First World War]]. 
 
 On April 9, 1940, Denmark was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout [[World War II]]. During the war, in 1943, Danes helped over 8,000 [[Jews]] to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them. 
 
 After the liberation of Denmark, one part of the country was not. That was the island of [[Bornholm]]. The German Commandant ''von Kamptz'' who was stationed there, refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden. The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]]. After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946. 
 
 After World War Two, Denmark became a member of [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' and have their own governments and limited power. 
 
 == Geography == 
 {{see also|List of cities in Denmark}} 
 [[File:Da-map.png|thumb|left|Map of Denmark]] 
 Denmark is the smallest of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The neighbours are [[Germany]] (to the south), [[Sweden]] (to the east), [[Norway]] (to the north) and the [[United Kingdom]] (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland (''Jylland''), the largest part of Denmark. It is connected to Germany by land. To the south-east there is the [[Baltic Sea]], to the west the [[North Sea]], to the north the [[Skagerrak]] and to the north-east the [[Kattegat]]. 
 
 The western part of Denmark is the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland]] ({{lang-da|Jylland}}, pronounced ''yoo´-land''), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. The largest islands are Zealand (''Sjælland''), and Funen (''Fyn''). To the east is the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]], the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen. 
 
 The country is quite flat. The highest hill or mountain is Møllehøj, which is 170.86 & nbsp;metres (560.56 & nbsp;ft) tall. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Dahlgaard|first=Jørgen|title=Danmarks nye top|url=http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf|journal=Aktuel Naturvidenskab|volume=2005|issue=1|page=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307040437/http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2008|accessdate=20 January 2012}} < /ref >  There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland.

The longest [[river]] in Denmark is the [[Gudenå]]. 
 
 === Climate === 
 The [[weather]] in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the [[winter]], it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of [[snow]]. Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The [[climate]] and [[topography]] are not good for winter sports. 
 
 Most [[summer]]s are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer. 
 
 The highest temperature ever recorded in Denmark was {{cvt|36.4|C|F}}, on 10 August 1975 in Holstebro. 
 And the lowest temperature ever recorded in Denmark was {{cvt|-31.2|C|F}}, on 8 January 1982 in Hørsted. < ref >  https://web.archive.org/web/20170426034355/http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/vejrekstremer-dk/ < /ref >

 == Politics == 
 [[File:Drottning Margrethe av Danmark.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]] has been the Queen of Denmark since 1972]] 
 [[File:Mette Frederiksen, 2017-06-16.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mette Frederiksen]], current [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] since 2019|left]] 
 Denmark has three branches of power; the [[judiciary]] (the courts), the executive (the Prime Minister and the cabinet) and the [[legislature]] (the [[Folketing|Danish parliament]]). The current Prime Minister of Denmark is [[Mette Frederiksen]], who was [[2019 Danish general election|elected]] in June 2019. 
 
 Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a [[monarchy|monarch]] (a king or queen). The current monarch is Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Margrethe II does not have a lot of power (she does not make any important decisions) and has a symbolic role. Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] in 1849. 
 
 Elections to the [[Folketing|parliament]] are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a [[coalition]] [[government]], and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister. 
 
 Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Denmark, from left to right on the [[Politics#Left-wing and right-wing political parties|political axis]]: 
 * Red-Green Alliance (Danish: ''Enhedslisten''), a far-left [[Socialism|socialist]] party. 
 * The Alternative (Danish: ''Alternativet''), a [[Green politics|green]] progressive party. 
 * Socialist People's Party (Danish: ''Socialistisk Folkeparti''), a [[socialist]] party. 
 * [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (Danish: ''Socialdemokraterne''), a [[left-wing]] party which is  " [[social democracy|social democratic]] "  (slightly socialist). 
 * [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], Liberal Party of Denmark (Danish: ''Venstre'' (meaning  " left " )), a [[liberal]] party. 
 * Danish Social Liberal Party (Danish: ''Det Radikale Venstre''), a radical left/borderline [[right-wing]] liberal party. 
 * Conservative People's Party (Danish: ''Det Konservative Folksparti''), a [[conservatism|conservative]] party. 
 * Liberal Alliance (Danish: ''Liberal Alliance''), a [[right-wing]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] party. 
 * Danish People's Party (Danish: ''Dansk Folkeparti''), a [[right-wing]] political party who dislike [[immigration]] (people from other countries who come to live in Denmark). 
 
 === Welfare === 
 Denmark, like the other [[Nordic countries]]. is well known for being a large [[welfare]] state. < ref name= " Esping-Andersen "  / >  The government provides many services to the public such as free [[health care]], free [[education]] (school and college) and free housing for the poor. Danes pay high taxes to fund welfare. 
 
 === Kingdom of Denmark === 
 [[File:Flag of Denmark (state).svg|thumb|Flag of the Kingdom of Denmark]] 
 In geography, ''Denmark'' is the land in northern Europe, where the [[Danish people|Danes]] live. In the political sense, the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' is the area which the Danish Monarch rules over. The Kingdom of Denmark includes Denmark and also includes the [[Faroe Islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and [[Greenland]] in [[North America]]. All three parts of the kingdom have different languages and culture. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are often considered to be separate countries but Denmark holds their [[sovereignty]]. 
 
 === Regions and municipalities === 
 [[File:Map DK Regions2.png|thumb|left|A map of the regions of Denmark]] 
 Denmark is divided into five regions ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''regioner'' or ''region'' for one). The regions replaced the former counties (''amter'') in January 2007. The regions are in charge of hospitals and health care.

 The regions are then subdivided into municipalities ({{lang-da|kommuner}}). There are currently 98 municipalities, but before January 2007 there were 275. The number of municipalities was decreased when it was decided that, to become more efficient, each should have a population of at least 20,000 . 
 
 == People == 
 [[File:Denmark-demography.png|thumb|left|175px|Population changes in Denmark the last 45 years]] 
 The biggest part (90.5%) of Denmark's population of just under 5.4 million is of Danish descent, according to 2009 statistics. Of the rest 8.9% who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants, many come from [[South Asia]] or the [[Middle East]]. There are also small groups of [[Inuit]] from [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]]. < ref name= " DSTimm " > {{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/HomeUK/Statistics/focus_on/focus_on_show.aspx?sci=565 |title=Immigrants and their descendants and foreign nationals|work=Statistics Denmark |publisher=Dst.dk |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Minorities in Denmark include [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Poles]], [[Syria|Syrians]], [[Germans]], [[Iraqis]], [[Romanians]] and people from former [[Yugoslavia]]. There are also other Asian and African populations in the country. Small numbers of [[Roma people|Roma]] and [[Hungarians]] live in Denmark. There is also a small [[Jews|Jewish]] population. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://minorityrights.org/country/denmark/|title=Denmark - World Directory of Minorities  &  Indigenous Peoples}} < /ref > 
 
 The Danes speak the national language, [[Danish language|Danish]], which is very similar to the other [[Scandinavia]]n languages. Swedish and Norwegian are so close to Danish that most Danes understand them. 
 
 As well as Danish, most Danes speak a foreign language too, such as [[English language|English]], which is popular as an [[international]] language, or [[German language|German]]. In the southern part of Jutland, a German minority speaks [[German language|German]]. On the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] is spoken, and people living in [[Greenland]] speak [[Greenlandic language|Inuit]]. 
 
 Religion does not play a large part in the life of most Danes and church attendance is very low. However, even though many Danes are [[atheist]], 80.4% < ref > [http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/statistik-og-oekonomi/kirkestatistik.html Membership Lutheran state church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119052707/http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/statistik-og-oekonomi/kirkestatistik.html |date=2012-01-19 }} (''Danish''). < /ref >  are members of the Protestant  " Church of Denmark "  ({{lang-da|Folkekirke}}, The National Church) which is the official  " state church "  of Denmark. The National Church is [[Lutheran]], which means it separated from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[16th Century]]. Other important faiths include [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] (the number of Muslims is increasing), other Protestant groups and Catholicism. 
 
 == Transport == 
 [[File:Storebaeltbroen.JPG|thumb|Great Belt Fixed Link is the biggest bridge in Denmark]] 
 Because of the many islands, Denmark has many [[bridge]]s. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by [[road]]s and [[railroad]]s. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years. The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers. 
 
 There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by [[boat]] or [[airplane]] to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away. If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build. 
 
 [[Cycling]] is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat. [[Copenhagen]] is a city that is very bicycle friendly, with bicycle lanes extending over 12,000 & nbsp;km. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | title = Cykelruter og regioner | accessdate = 20 January 2012 | publisher = Visitdenmark.com | language = Danish | archive-date = 15 March 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315171238/http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Culture == 
 The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea. In earlier days, people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat. Many Danes were [[fishing|fishermen]] or [[merchant]]s. Even today, many Danes spend much time near or at the sea. 
 
 [[Farm]]ing has always been one of the main [[Profession|occupations]]. Because of the [[climate]] and the [[soil]], Denmark is a good place for [[agriculture]]. [[Export]] of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of [[income]] for the country. Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world. 
 
 Perhaps the most famous Dane is actually [[Hamlet]], the title character of [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play, which was set in the real castle of Kronborg in [[Helsingør]], north of Copenhagen. The play was based on an old Danish myth of the [[Viking]] Prince Amled of Jutland, and his quest for revenge against his father's killer. Another widely known Dane is [[Hans Christian Andersen]], a [[writer]] mostly famous for such [[fairy tale]]s as  " [[The Little Mermaid]] " , and  " [[The Ugly Duckling]] " . Also [[Karen Blixen]], [[Tycho Brahe]] and the philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] are well known worldwide. There are many famous Danish scientists, including [[Niels Bohr]], the famous physicist who developed the first working model for the [[atom]], and [[Ole Rømer]], who discovered the [[speed of light]]. Hans Kirk, although less well known outside of Denmark, is the writer of the best-selling Danish novel of all time, ''The Fishermen''. 
 
 === Music === 
 Danes enjoy many different types of music, including [[ballet]]s, [[jazz music]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]]. Denmark's most famous [[classical music|classical]] [[composer]] is [[Carl Nielsen]]. Famous Danish bands include [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], a pop band, and [[The Raveonettes]], an indie rock band. The most famous Danish rock star is [[Lars Ulrich]] of the band [[Metallica]]. 
 
 === Food  === 
 [[File:Smørrebrød 5.jpg|thumb|170px|Danish open sandwich (''smørrebrød'') on dark rye bread. A popular food item in Denmark.]] 
 The [[cuisine]] of Denmark shares much with the other Nordic countries ([[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[Sweden]]) as well as northern [[Germany]]. Common meats are [[pork]] and [[fish]]. Traditional Danish food includes ''frikadeller'' (fried [[meatball]]s, often served with [[potato]]es and various sorts of [[sauce|gravy]]). Fish is widely eaten, especially on the west coast of [[Jutland]]. 
 
 === Holidays === 
 [[Christmas]] ({{lang-da|Jul}}) is the main feast of the year. Christmas is traditionally celebrated on the eve, December 24, and this is when the main Christmas meal is eaten and presents are unwrapped. 
 
 In midwinter, a [[fasting|fast]] is celebrated. Children are dressed up, and go from house to house begging for money. This practice has in the recent years been taken over by [[Halloween]], and most people give candy not money. A barrel filled with candy is smashed with clubs. The person who makes the candy fall out is appointed queen of cats and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king of cats. 
 
 Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of June 23. Most Danes have a three-week summer holiday in July or August.

 === Sports === 
 The most popular sport in Denmark is [[Football (soccer)|football]] (soccer). Sailing, swimming and other water sports are very popular because of the long coastline. Another common sport is cycling, (Copenhagen has been nicknamed the  " City of Cyclists "  because of the popularity of bicycles for moving around), which has become popular in Denmark partly because of the flat land all over the country. Indoor sports such as badminton and handball are also popular during the long winters. 
 
 == Monarchy == 
 [[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg|thumb|right|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] (left) and her late husband, Prince Henrik (right).]] 
 [[Monarch]] is a word that means [[king]] or [[queen]]. Denmark is the oldest monarchy in Europe. < ref > [http://www.nettyroyal.nl/denmark2.html Danish Royal Family] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025081456/http://www.nettyroyal.nl/denmark2.html |date=2013-10-25 }}. Nettyroyal.nl. < /ref >  The current monarch is [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]], who has been the queen since 1972. Denmark does not currently have a [[King]]. Margrethe's husband was called a [[prince]] because he was the son-in-law, not the [[son]], of the previous King. He died on 13. February 2018 at the age of 83. The royal couple have two [[children]]: 
 * Crown Prince Frederik who married an [[Australia]]n woman named [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary]], and have 4 children: 
 ** Prince Christian 
 ** Princess Isabella 
 ** Prince Vincent  &  Princess Josephine (twins) 
 * Joachim married a [[British]] woman from [[Hong Kong]] but later divorced in 2005 after being married for 10 years. He has two sons: 
 ** Prince Nikolai 
 ** Prince Felix 
 
 In 2008 Prince Joachim married for the second time. His new wife is from [[France]] and is called Marie, with whom he has a son and a daughter. 
 ** Prince Henrik 
 ** Princess Athena
