 '''Psocoptera''' are an order of [[pterygota|winged insect]]s that are commonly known as '''booklice''', '''barklice''' or '''barkflies'''. They first appeared in the [[Permian]] period, 295–248 million years ago. They are often regarded as the most primitive of the [[True bug|hemipterans]]. Their name originates from the Greek word ''psokos'' meaning gnawed or rubbed and ''ptera'' meaning wings. There are more than 5,500 species in 41 families in three suborders. Many of these species have only been described in recent years. 
 
 They range in size from 1–10 millimeters (0.04–0.4 in) in length.
