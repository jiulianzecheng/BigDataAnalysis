 In [[economics]], the term '''stagflation''' is used when there is almost no growth in [[production]], < ref > production = total amount of [[goods]] and [[wikt:service|services]] produced < /ref >  yet there is high [[inflation]], and [[unemployment]] is high. This was supposed to be impossible under the kind of economics described by [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] ([[Keynesian economics]]). 
 
 Stagflation is a [[portmanteau word]] of ''[[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]'' and ''[[inflation]]''. It is used in [[economics]] when the [[inflation rate]] is high, the growth rate slows down, and unemployment stays high. It raises a dilemma for economic [[policy]] since actions designed to lower inflation may exacerbate unemployment, and vice versa. 
 
 The term is generally attributed to a British politician who became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1970, [[Iain Macleod]], who coined the phrase in his speech to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1965. < ref > Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stagflation (accessed 5 May 2007). < /ref > < ref > British ''[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]' Official Report'' (also known as ''Hansard''), 17 November 1965, page 1,165. < /ref > < ref name=BankofEngland2002 > Edward Nelson; Kalin Nikolov (2002) (PDF).  (Report). Bank of England Working Paper.Introduction, page 9.  < /ref > < ref name=macroeconomics > {{cite book|first= N. Gregory |last=Mankiw|year=2008|title=Principles of Macroeconomics}} page 464  < /ref > < ref > Nelson and Nikolov also point out that the term 'stagflation' has sometimes been erroneously attributed to Paul Samuelson. < /ref >   
 
 Keynes didn't use the term, but some of his work refers to the conditions most would recognise as stagflation. In the version of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian macroeconomic theory]] which was dominant between the end of World War II (WWII) and the late-1970s, inflation and recession were regarded as mutually exclusive, the relationship between the two being described by the [[Phillips curve]].  Stagflation is very costly and difficult to stop once it starts. 
 
 A political measure called the [[Misery index (economics)|Misery Index]] is got by adding the inflation rate to the unemployment rate. 
 
 This situation usually begins with things beginning to cost more while fewer of the things are being made. Because fewer things are being made, fewer people are needed to make them. This causes unemployment to increase. All three of these [[factor]]s together cause stagflation — [[wikt:stagnate|stagnation]] in production and employment and increasing inflation. It is also because of  " cost push "  factors. When it begins to cost more to make an item, the [[price]] will increase. People will be less likely to [[investment|invest]] money in the [[company]]. This will lead to more unemployment. 
 
 == 1970s recession == 
 The 1973–75 recession or 1970s recession was a period of economic stagnation in much of the Western world during the 1970s, putting an end to the general post-World War II economic boom. It differed from many previous recessions as being a stagflation, where high unemployment coincided with high inflation.
