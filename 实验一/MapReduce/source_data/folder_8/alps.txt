 The '''Alps''' ({{Lang-it|Alpi}}, {{Lang-fr|Alpes}}, {{Lang-de|text=Alpen}}, {{Lang-bar|Oipm}}, {{Lang-rm|Alps}}, {{Lang-sl|Alpe}}, {{Lang-oc|Aups, Alps}}) < ref > {{lang-de|Alpen}}; {{lang-it|Alpi}}; {{lang-fr|Alpes}}; {{lang-oc|Aups/Alps}}; {{lang-rm|Alps}} < /ref >  is the greatest [[mountain range]] of [[Europe]]. It reaches from [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]] in the east; through [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Germany]]; to [[France]] in the west. The original meaning of the word was 'white'. < ref > The [[English language|English]] name ''Alps'' was taken from [[French language|French]] from [[Latin]] ''Alpes'', which may be ultimately alike with Latin ''albus'' ( " white " ). The German ''Albe'', ''Alpe'' or ''Alp'' (f., Old High German ''alpâ'', plural ''alpûn''), and the French ''Alpage'' or ''Alpe'' in the singular mean  " [[alpine pasture]] " , and only in the plural may also refer to the mountain range as a whole. < /ref > < ref > Jacob Grimm, ''Deutsches Wörterbuch'', s.v.  " Albe " ,  " Alpe " . The original meaning being  " white "  (in reference to the permanent snow. The term may be common Italo-Celtic, since [[Celtic languages]] also have terms for high mountains derived from ''alp''. German ''Alpen'' is the accusative in origin, but  was made the nominative in Modern German, whence also ''Alm''. < /ref > 
 
 The highest mountain in the Alps is [[Mont Blanc]], at {{convert|4808|m|ft|0}}, on the Italian–French border. 
 
 == Geography == 
 [[File:Formation Alps illustration.png|right|thumb|200px|How the Alps were made.]] 
 The Alps stretch from [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]] in the east, through [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Germany]] to [[France]] in the west. 
 
 === Division === 
 The mountains are divided into the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps. The division is along the line between [[Lake Constance]] and [[Lake Como]], following the [[Rhine]] (on the north side, in Switzerland) and the river [[Mera]] in the South (in Italy). The Western Alps are higher, but their central chain is shorter and curved; they are located in Italy, France and Switzerland.  
 
 The Eastern Alps (main ridge system elongated and broad) belong to Austria, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Slovenia and Switzerland. 
 
 The highest peaks of the Western Alps are Mont Blanc, 4,808 metres (15,774 & nbsp;ft), Mont Blanc de Courmayeur 4,748 metres (15,577 & nbsp;ft), the [[Dufourspitze]] 4,634 metres (15,203 & nbsp;ft) and the other summits of the [[Monte Rosa]] group, and the Dom, 4,545 metres (14,911 & nbsp;ft). The highest peak in the Eastern Alps is [[Piz Bernina]], 4,049 metres (13,284 & nbsp;ft). Perhaps the most famous location for tourist to the Alps are the [[Swiss Alps]]. 
 
 === Main chain === 
 [[File:Hauteroute.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[watershed]] between Italy and Switzerland (View from [[Tête Blanche]], [[Pennine Alps]])]] 
 The main chain of the Alps follows the [[watershed]] from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Wienerwald]], Austria, defining partially the northern border of [[Italy]]. It then passes over many of the highest and most [[wikt:famous|famous]] peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to Col de Tende it runs to the west before turning to the northwest and then, to the north, near the Colle della Maddalena. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain goes about northeast, a heading it follows until its end near [[Vienna]]. 
 
 == Four-thousanders == 
 The Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) has [[wikt:define|defined]] a list of 82  " official "  Alpine 4,000-[[meter]] (13,123 & nbsp;[[ft]]) peaks. The list has many sub-peaks with little [[Topographic prominence|prominence]], but good for [[mountaineering]]. Here are the twelve four-thousanders with at least 1 & nbsp;[[km]] prominence.

 == Alpinisme == 
 [[Karl Blodig]] was the first person to climb all the main four-thousand meter peaks, round 1900. 
 
 The [[Alpine Club]] is the oldest organization of mountaineers of the world. It’s an organization from [[Great Britain]], formed in 1857. < ref > [http://www.alpine-club.org.uk Homepage ot the Alpine Club]. < /ref > 
 
 The [[Swiss Alpine Club]] was founded in 1863. < ref > [https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/ Homepage of the Swiss Alpine Club]. < /ref > 
 
 == Geology and orogeny == 
 The reason mountains form is usually the moving together of [[continental plate]]s of the [[Earth]]'s [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The Alps rose as a result of the slow but gigantic pressure of the [[African]] plate as it moved north against the stable [[Eurasia]]n landmass. In particular, Italy (which had been a separate island) got pushed into Europe. 
 
 This all took place in the [[Tertiary]] period, mostly in the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]]. That's about 35 to 5 million years ago. 
 
 The Alps are just a part of a larger [[orogeny|orogenic]] belt of mountain chains, called the [[Alpide belt]]. It reaches through southern Europe and Asia from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] most of the way to the [[Himalayas]].   
 
 A gap in these mountain chains in central Europe [[wikt:separate|separates]] the Alps from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] off to the east. [[wikt:subsidence|Subsidence]] is the cause of the gaps in between. 
 
 A great and ancient ocean was once between Africa and Europe, the [[Tethys Ocean]]. Now [[sediment]]s of the Tethys Ocean basin and its [[Mesozoic]] and early [[Cenozoic]] [[Stratum|strata]] sit high above sea level. Even [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[Basement (geology)|basement]] rocks are found high on Mont Blanc, the [[Matterhorn]], and other high peaks in the [[Pennine Alps]] and [[Hohe Tauern]]. 
 
 The [[wikt:formation|formation]] of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is a more recent development. 
 
 == Transport == 
 The Alps do not make an impassable block; the common passes have been traveled by since the [[ancient history]] for war and [[commerce]], and later by [[pilgrim]]s, students and tourists. 
 [[Mountain pass]]es give paths between mountains, for [[road]], [[train]] or [[Feet|foot]] traffic.  Some are famous, being used for thousands of years. 
 
 Important passes in the Alps are, e.g.:

 == Travel and visitors == 
 [[File:St.Bartholomä.jpg|thumb|Königssee, [[Bavaria]]]] 
 The Alps are popular both in [[summer]] and in [[winter]]. The Alps as a place for sightseeing and [[sport]]s. Winter sports (Alpine and Nordic [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], tobogganing, snowshoeing, ski tours) can be learned in most [[region]]s from December to April. In summer, the Alps are popular with [[Hiking|hikers]], mountain [[bike]]rs, paragliders, and mountaineers. There are also alpine lakes which attract [[Swimming|swimmers]], [[sailors]] and [[Surfing|surfers]]. The lower places and bigger [[town]]s of the Alps are well served by motorways and main [[road]]s, but higher passes and by-roads can be bad even in the summer. Many passes are closed in winter. Many airports around the Alps (and some within), as well as long-distance rail links from all bordering countries, afford large numbers of travelers easy access from abroad. The Alps normally has more than 100 [[million]] visitors a year. 
 
 == Climate == 
 The Alps is split into five climate zones, each with a different kind of environment. The climate, plant life and animal life vary on different sections or zones of the mountain.  
 
 [[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|right|Pine trees above the [[Aletsch Glacier]], [[Valais]]]] 
 
 # The section of the Alps that is above 3,000 metres is called the névé zone.  This area, which has the coldest climate, is permanently coated with compressed snow.  Plants are therefore scarce in the névé zone. 
 # The [[Alpine tundra|alpine zone]] lies between the height of 2,000 and 3,000 metres.  This zone is less cold than in the névé zone.  Wildflowers and grasses grow here. 
 # Just below the alpine zone is the [[subalpine zone]], 1,500 to 2,000 metres high.  Forests of fir trees and spruce trees grow in the subalpine zone as the temperature slowly goes up. 
 # At about 1,000 to 1,500 metres high is the arable zone.  Millions of [[oak]] [[trees]] sprout in this area.  This is also where farming takes place. 
 # Below 1,000 metres are the lowlands.  Here, a larger variety of plants are produced. Aside from plants, villages are also in the lowlands because the temperature is easier for humans and farm animals. 
 
 The Alps is a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher land. A rise from [[sea level]] into the upper regions causes the [[temperature]] to decrease. The effect of [[mountain]] chains on winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands and loses heat, and drops [[snow]] or [[rain]]. 
 
 == Plants == 
 The typical [[tree]]s—[[oak]], [[beech]], [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore maple]] have a natural height limit: the 'tree line'. Their upper limit matches the change in [[climate]] which comes with increasing height. The change from a [[temperate]] to a [[cold]]er [[climate]] is also shown true by a change in the wild flowering plant life. This limit normally lies about {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1}} above the sea on the north side of the Alps. On the southern slopes, it often reaches to {{convert|1500|m|ft|-1}}, sometimes even to {{convert|1700|m|ft|-1}}. 
 
 The Alps do not always have the typical trees. People have felled them in many places. Except for the beech [[forest]]s of the Austrian Alps, forests of the typical [[deciduous tree]]s are hardly found. Where such [[woods]] were, [[Scots pine]] and Norway spruce now grow. These trees are less [[wikt:sensitive|sensitive]] to the attacks of [[Domestic goat|goat]]s who eat the saplings of deciduous trees. 
 
 Above the tree line, there is often a band of [[wikt:dwarf|dwarf]] [[pine tree]]s (''Pinus mugo''), which is taking place of dwarf [[shrub]]s. These shrubs are ''[[Rhododendron]] ferrugineum'' (on [[acid]] [[soil]]s) or ''Rhododendron hirsutum'' (on non-acid soils).  
 
 Above this is the alpine [[meadow]]. Above the alpine meadow is where plant life becomes less and less common. At these great heights, the plants are likely to make separate groups. In the Alps, many species of [[flowering plant]]s have been recorded above {{convert|4000|m|ft|-1}}. These are like ''[[Ranunculus]] glacialis'', ''Androsace alpina'' and ''[[Saxifraga]] biflora''.
