 '''''Pneumodesmus newmani''''' is a species of [[millipede]] that lived during the late [[Wenlock epoch]] of the [[Silurian]] period around {{Ma|428}}. < ref name= " Wilson " / > < ref name= " BBC " > {{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3427499.stm |title=Fossil find 'oldest land animal'}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|first1=C.H.|last1=Wellman|first2=G.|last2=Lopes|first3=Z.|last3=McKellar|first4=A.|last4=Hartley|year=2023|title=Age of the basal ‘Lower Old Red Sandstone’ Stonehaven Group of Scotland: The oldest reported air-breathing land animal is Silurian (late Wenlock) in age|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|publisher=The Geological Society of London|doi=10.1144/jgs2023-138|issn=0016-7649}} < /ref >   
 
 It is the first [[myriapod]] fossil, and the oldest known creature to have lived on land. < ref name= " CNN " > {{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/01/27/environment.britain.fossil.reut/index.html |title=Fossil millipede found to be oldest land creature |publisher=[[CNN]] (from [[Reuters]]) |date=2004}} < /ref >  The single specimen was discovered in 2004 near [[Stonehaven]], [[Aberdeenshire]]. < ref name= " BBC " / >   
 
 ==Discovery and naming== 
 The fossil of ''P. newmani'' was found by Mike Newman. He is a bus driver and [[amateur]] [[palaeontologist]] from [[Aberdeen]]. The fossil was in a layer of [[sandstone]] rocks on the fore[[shore]] of Cowie, near [[Stonehaven]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=''Pneumodesmus newmani'' Exhibition |url=http://www.stonehavenguide.net/prods/fossil-over-420-million-years-old.html |publisher=Stonehaven Guide |access-date=2019-01-13 |archive-date=2016-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224094410/http://www.stonehavenguide.net/prods/fossil-over-420-million-years-old.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The species was later [[specific name (zoology)|called]]  " ''newmani'' "  in honour of its finder. The [[holotype| fossil]] is kept in [[Royal Museum|National Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]]. < ref > {{cite journal |url=http://www.paulselden.net/uploads/7/5/3/2/7532217/seldenread2008.pdf |journal=Bulletin of the British Myriapod  &  Isopod Group |volume=23 |year=2008 |title=The oldest land animals: Silurian millipedes from Scotland |author= Selden, Paul  &  Read, Helen |pages=36–37}} < /ref >   
 
 == Description == 
 In the photograph above, you can see the back is covered with hard plates, and wispy slender legs. The animal is definitely [[segmented]], and it is like, or related to, millipedes. < ref name= " Wilson "  / > 
 
 Its cuticle has what look like openings or [[spiracle]]s. These are part of a [[gas exchange]] system that would work in air. So ''P. newmani'' is thought to be the earliest documented [[arthropod]] with a [[trachea]]l system, and the first known oxygen-breathing animal on land. < ref name= " CNN " / >
