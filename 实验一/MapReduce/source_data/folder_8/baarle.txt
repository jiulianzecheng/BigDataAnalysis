 Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau each have a [[Bürgermeister|burgermeester]] (mayor). Each town has its own elected town council and each has a police station. Each town has its own church. In some areas the two town councils can cooperate. They have set up a joint council to look after things like electricity, water and gas supplies, highway maintenance and refuse collection.  
 
 Both councils also fund a joint cultural centre that houses a combined library. The cultural centre has two official entrances. The international border passes through the building. The Dutch entrance is at 7 Pastoor de Katerstraat. The Belgian entrance is at 5 Pastoor de Katerstraat. The tourist office is affiliated to both the Dutch and the Belgian tourist boards.     
 
 Dutch trading law applies to the Dutch parts of the town. Belgian trading laws apply to the Belgian parts of the town. Difference in the laws have encouraged smuggling. After the [[Second World War]] many people smuggled butter from the Netherlands into Belgium. < ref > {{cite web
