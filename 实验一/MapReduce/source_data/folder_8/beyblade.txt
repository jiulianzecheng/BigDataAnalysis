 '''Beyblade''' (爆転シュート ベイブレード, ''Bakuten Shūto Beiburedo'', literally translates to '''''Explosive Shooting Beyblade''''') is an [[anime]] and [[manga]] series about a group of kids battling with highly powerful spinning tops enchanted with sacred bit-[[beast]]s or [[spirit]]s of mythical and powerful creatures. 
 
 == Synopsis == 
 Thirteen-year-old Tyson Granger (Takao Kinomiya), along with his teammates, Kai Hiwatari, Max Tate (Max Mizuhura), and Ray Kon (Rei Kon), strive to become the greatest beybladers in the world. With the technical help of the team's resident genius, Kenny (Kyouju), and with the powerful strength of their bit beasts, the Bladebreakers armed with their tops (AKA: blades) attempt to reach their goal.
