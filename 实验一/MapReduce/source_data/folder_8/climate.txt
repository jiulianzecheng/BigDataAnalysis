 '''Climate''' means the usual condition of the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and other [[Meteorology|meteorological]] patterns in an area of the Earth's surface for a long time. In simple terms, climate is the average condition for about thirty years. Climate and [[weather]] are different: weather is the day to day conditions in the atmosphere. 
 
 '''The types of climates are''': [[Tropical climate|Tropical]], [[Desert climate|Desert/dry]], [[Temperate zone|Temperate]], [[Polar climate|Polar]], [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]].  
 * [[Polar climate]] (also called boreal climate), has long, usually very cold winters, and short summers. For example, near the north and south poles. 
 * [[Temperate]] climates have four [[season]]s. Some of the countries which have a temperate climate are: most of the [[Europe]]an countries. 
 * [[Desert climate|Deserts]] are very dry. They just have one or two seasons such as: [[Saudi Arabia]] and many [[Africa]]n countries. 
 * [[Tropical climate]]s have warm temperature and only two seasons; wet and dry. An example of a place with a tropical climate is the [[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[Brazil]]. 
 * The [[Mediterranean climate]] is usually hot and dry in summer, and is cool and wet in winter. An example of a country with a Mediterranean climate is [[Spain]]. 
 
 The [[latitude]], ground, and [[elevation|height]] can change the climate of a location. It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by [[temperature]] and [[precipitation]]. The most commonly used classification was the [[Köppen climate classification]], first made by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, < ref > C. W. Thornthwaite,  " An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate " , ''Geographical Review'', 38:55-94, 1948 < /ref >  which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but [[evapotranspiration]] too. This makes it useful for studying how many different [[Biodiversity|kinds of animal species]] there are, and about the things that could happen when climates change. The Bergeron and [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]]s focus more on where the [[air mass]]es which help make climates come from. 
 
 [[Climate change|Climates can change]] after a long time. Nowadays [[global warming|people are making the world warmer]] in many places, but not in all: 12/2023  " Beijing shivers through coldest December on record "  (BBC). North Korea and Japan are also unusually cold, Decenber 2023.
