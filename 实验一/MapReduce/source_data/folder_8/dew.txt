 '''Dew''' is a thin film of water that has [[condensation|condensed]] on the surface of objects near the ground in the morning or evening. < ref name=factmonster > {{Cite web |url= http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/weather/A0815362.html |title=dew — FactMonster.com |work=factmonster.com |access-date=19 April 2010}} < /ref >  These objects cool in the night. When they cool, the thin layer of air around them cools too. This makes some water vapor condense on the object. < ref name=factmonster/ >  The condensation happens because the air is able to hold less water when it is cooled. The temperature at which condensation begins is called the ''dew point''. If the dew point temperature becomes lower than 32 & nbsp;°F (0 & nbsp;°C), the dew turns into [[frost]]. Most people agree that the water in the dew comes from the [[atmosphere]]. < ref name=factmonster/ >  However, some studies suggest that it also comes up through the [[soil]] and then condenses on the ground. < ref name=factmonster/ >  This happens, though, only when conditions are right. 
 
 Dew forms best when the atmosphere is clean, the air is calm, and there is not much wind. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/160405/dew|title=dew (meteorology) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=britannica.com|access-date=10 May 2010}} < /ref >  It does not always form in the night and outdoors, though. They also work when [[glasses|eyeglasses]] get [[steam]]y in warm, wet rooms. Dew may also happen in [[industry|industrial]] processes. However, people use the word [[condensation]] more often than dew. 
 
 In the [[Old Testament]] dew is used as a [[symbol]]. Deuteronomy 32:3 says:  " ...my [[wikt:speak|speech]] shall [[:en:wikt:ditill|distill]] as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender [[herb]], and as the [[precipitation|showers]] upon the [[grass]]. "  ({{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|32|3}})
