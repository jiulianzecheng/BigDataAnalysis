'''Precognition''' (also known as ''premonition'' or ''second sight'') is an alleged [[Psychosis|psychic]] ability to see events in the [[future]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Precognition|publisher=Skeptic's Dictionary|url=http://skepdic.com/precog.html|access-date=Feb 2, 2016}} < /ref >  However, as with most other forms of [[extra-sensory perception]], there is no evidence any person has ever had precognition ability. < ref > {{cite web|title=Extra-Sensory Perception|publisher=The Science Daily|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110518080059.htm|access-date=Feb 2, 2016}} < /ref >  But it still appears within [[movie]]s, [[book]]s and discussions within the [[parapsychology]] community.
