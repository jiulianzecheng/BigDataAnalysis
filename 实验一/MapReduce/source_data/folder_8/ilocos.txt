 '''Ilocos Region''' is a region in the [[Philippines]]. Its regional center is [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]], La Union. The region has four [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]: [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[La Union]] and [[Pangasinan]]. 
 
 Inhabitants are called ''Ilocanos'' and they speak the [[Iloko language|Ilocano language]]. 
 
 The term '''Ilocos Region''' is derived from this term. However, the designation of '''Ilocos''' as the basis of the name of the region promotes the wrong notion that all the residents of Region 1 are Ilocanos. Because 28% of the inhabitants are Pangasinan people, who belong to a different ethno-linguistic group from the Ilocanos.
