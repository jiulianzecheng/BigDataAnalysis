 '''Annonaceae''' (custard-apple, or annona [[Family (biology)|family]]) is the largest family of the [[Magnoliales|magnolia order]]. It has 129 [[Genus|genera]] and 2,400 species.  < ref > {{Cite web|title=Flowering Plant Families, UH Botany|url=http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/carr/annon.htm|access-date=2020-08-14|website=www.botany.hawaii.edu}} < /ref >   
 
 Many species are valuable for their large pulpy fruits. Some are useful for their [[timber]], while others are prized as ornamentals. The family consists of [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, and woody climbers found mainly in the tropics, with a few species in temperate regions. 
 
 Their fruits defend themselves against some herbivores. Eating the neotropical plant ''Annona muricata'' (soursop, ''graviola, guanabana'') is a causal agent in  " atypical [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinsonism]] " . The causative agent, [[annonacin]], is present in the seeds and leaves of many of the Annonaceae, though not in any significant quantity in the fruit flesh. It is thought to be responsible for up to 70% of Parkinsonian conditions in Guadeloupe. Exposure is typically through traditional food and natural medicines. < ref name= " health_parkinsons1 " > {{cite journal |last=Lannuzel |first=A |title=The mitochondrial complex i inhibitor annonacin is toxic to mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons by impairment of energy metabolism |journal=Neuroscience |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=287–296 |publisher=International Brain Research Organization |date=2003-10-06 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(03)00441-X |pmid=14521988 |s2cid=37873631 |display-authors=etal}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |last=Champy |first=Pierre |title=Quantification of acetogenins in Annona muricata linked to atypical parkinsonism in Guadeloupe |journal=Movement Disorders |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1629–1633 |date=2005-08-02 |doi=10.1002/mds.20632 |pmid=16078200 |s2cid=31508365 |display-authors=etal}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |title=Is atypical parkinsonism in the Caribbean caused by the consumption of Annonacae? |pmid=17017523 |journal=J Neural Transm Suppl |year=2006 |pages=153–157 |issue=70 |vauthors=Lannuzel A, Höglinger GU, Champy P, Michel PP, Hirsch EC, Ruberg M |doi=10.1007/978-3-211-45295-0_24 |volume=70 |series=Journal of Neural Transmission.

Presumably some favoured herbivores can eat it without ill effects. In some plants, seeds contain irritants to encourage early defecation.
