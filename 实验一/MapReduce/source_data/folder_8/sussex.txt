 '''Sussex''' is a [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] in [[South East England|South East]] [[England]]. Its area is more or less the same as that of the ancient [[Kingdom of Sussex]]. It is divided for local government into [[West Sussex]] and [[East Sussex]] and the City of [[Brighton and Hove]]. The city of Brighton and Hove became a [[unitary authority]] in [[1997]]; and got City status in [[2000]]. Until then [[Chichester]] had been Sussex's only city. 
 
 Sussex still has a strong local identity and the county's unofficial anthem is ''[[Sussex by the Sea]]''. The county's motto,  " We wun't be druv " , shows the  strong-willed nature of its people in past centuries.
