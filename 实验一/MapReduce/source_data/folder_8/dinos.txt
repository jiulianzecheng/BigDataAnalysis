 In the [[Typology of Greek vase shapes|typology of ancient Greek pottery]], the '''''dinos''''' (plural ''dinoi'') is a mixing bowl or cauldron. ''Dinos'' means  " drinking cup, "  but in modern typology is used (wrongly) for the same shape as a ''[[lebes]]'', that is, a bowl with a spherical body meant to sit on a stand. It has no handles and no feet. < ref > Brian A. Sparkes, ''Greek Pottery: An Introduction'' (Manchester University Press, 1991), pp. 62, 81, 83. < /ref > 
 
 The [[Dinos Painter]], one of the ancient Greek artists known for [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase painting]], takes his name from the type of vase characteristic of his work. < ref > Sparkes, ''Greek Pottery'', p. 115. < /ref > 
 
 Dinos were used for mixing water and wine, as it was considered rude to drink straight out of the goblet, at the time.
