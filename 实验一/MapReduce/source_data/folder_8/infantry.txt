 '''Infantry''' is the branch of a country's [[army]] that fights on foot. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/infantry |title=infantry |author= |website= |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}} < /ref >   A member of the infantry is called an '''infantryman'''. Infantrymen are also called '''foot soldiers''' or footmen. Infantry is different than [[cavalry]] because infantry members fight on their own two feet, without vehicles or animals to ride on. Historically, infantrymen were trained to use [[spear]]s, [[sword]]s and [[shield]]s. Modern infantrymen are trained to use many different kinds of weapons, including [[rifle]]s, [[grenade]]s, [[rocket]] launchers, pistols, [[sniper rifle]]s, and [[machine gun]]s. It is one of the most dangerous jobs in any country's military. Since the end of [[World War II]], 81% of Americans killed in battle were infantrymen. < ref name=ScalesWT > {{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/9/improving-infantry-survival/ |title=Improving infantry survival |author=Robert Scales |date=9 August 2016 |website= |publisher=The Washington Times, LLC |accessdate=12 August 2016}} < /ref >  This is despite the fact that the infantry made up only about 4% of the US military. < ref name=ScalesWT/ >  The infantry is the backbone of the military and the most important branch of the army.
