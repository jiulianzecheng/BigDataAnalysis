 '''Tetraplegia''' (or '''quadriplegia''') is a condition in which a human loses use of all [[limb]]s and the [[torso]]. It usually affects both the ability to move and the use of the [[sensory system|senses]]. 
 
 ''Quadriplegia'' is the common term in [[North America]]. ''Tetraplegia'' is the term in [[Europe]]. 
 
 Tetraplegia is caused by damage either to the [[brain]] or to the [[spinal cord]] at the level of the [[cervical vertebrae]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Quadriplegia|publisher=Apparelyzed|url=http://www.apparelyzed.com/quadriplegia.html|accessdate=Jan 31, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=September 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  People with an injury at the [[Atlas (anatomy)|C1 vertebra]] may lose functions from the neck down.
