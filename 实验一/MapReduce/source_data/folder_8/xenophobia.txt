'''Xenophobia''' is the fear or dislike of strangers or unknown things. Xenophobia can also mean the fear of trying new things, but it is usually the fear of differences between people. Xenophobia may be about foreign things or people, or just the attitudes of a group towards other groups. It may increase because of [[immigration]]. Apparently, xenophobia has always existed. Even the [[Ancient Greeks]] believed that [[barbarians]] (non-Greeks) were naturally meant to be enslaved. < ref > Harrison, Thomas 2002. Greeks and barbarians. Taylor  &  Francis. p. 3. {{ISBN|9780415939591}} < /ref > 
 
 Sometimes xenophobia overlaps with other types of phobias such as [[Afrophobia]], [[Islamophobia]], [[Anti-German sentiment|Germanophobia]] or [[Anti-Mexican sentiment]]. < ref > Islamophobia: making muslims the enemy - Page 5, Gabriel Greenberg - 2008 < /ref > 
 
 The [[Vienna Declaration]] by [[United Nations]] declares that all people should have equal [[human rights]] and [[toleration]].
