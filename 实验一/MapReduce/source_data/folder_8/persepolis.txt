'''Persepolis''' (Old Persian: 'Pars', [[New Persian]]: {{lang|fa|تخت جمشید}}, ''Takht-e Jamshid'') was an ancient capital of the second Iranian dynasty, the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Ancient Persians called it Parsa, meaning ''the city of Persians''. Persepolis ({{lang-el|Περσες πόλις}}) is the [[Greek language|Greek]] translation of the name. In modern Iran, the city is known as Takht-e-Jamshid ([[Throne]] of [[Jamshid]]). The largest building in Persepolis is the [[Apadana Hall]] with 72 columns. The Tachara [[palace]] built by [[Darius I]] is also an important building. The [[Hadish]] palace in Persepolis was started by [[Xerxes]] and finished by his son [[Artaxerxes]]. 
 
 Persepolis has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1979.
