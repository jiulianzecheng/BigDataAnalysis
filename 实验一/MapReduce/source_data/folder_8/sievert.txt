The '''Sievert''', abbreviated ''Sv'' is the [[SI unit]] to measure the [[dose equivalent|equivalent dose]] and [[commited dose]] of [[ionizing radiation]], which represent the risk of bodily radiation dosage and harm as a result of it. It looks at how an [[organism]] reacts to a given dose. This is different from measuring the total absorbed dose, which is measured in [[gray (unit)|grays]]. This unit is important in [radiation protection] and medical treatments such as [radiotherapy].  It is named after [[Rolf Sievert]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] physicist and doctor, who did research on how radiation affects organisms.
