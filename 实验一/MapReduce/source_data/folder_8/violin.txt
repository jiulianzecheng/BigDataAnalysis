 The violin is important in European and Arabian music. No other instrument has played such an important part in Europe. The modern violin is about 400 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1000 years. By the time the modern [[orchestra]]s started to form in the 17th century, the violin was nearly fully developed. It became the most important orchestral instrument - in fact, nearly half of the instruments in the orchestra is made up of violins, which are divided into two parts:  " first violins "  and  " second violins " . Nearly every composer wrote for the violin, whether as a [[solo (music)|solo]] instrument, in [[chamber music]], in orchestral music, folk music, and even in [[jazz]]. 
 
 The violin is sometimes called a “[[fiddle]]”.  Someone who plays it is a “fiddler”. To  " fiddle "  means  " to play the fiddle " . This word can be used as a [[nickname]] for the violin. It is properly used when talking about [[folk music]], but is used in all kinds of music.

 {{Unsourced section|date=September 2020}} 
 The biggest part of the violin is the wooden body. This acts as a [[resonator|resonating]] box. It makes the [[vibration|vibrating]] strings sound louder. Many of the parts of the violin are named after parts of the body. The front is called the “belly”. The back is called the “back”. The sides are the “ribs”. The strings go from near the top of the “neck” down the “fingerboard” and on to the “tail piece”. The strings go across the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the tailpiece. The bridge is not fixed onto the violin. It is held in place by the strings. The strings keep it in place because they are so tight. If the strings are completely loosened, the bridge will not stay on. The bridge helps to send the vibrations of the strings down to the body of the instrument. Inside the body there is a “soundpost”. This is a small piece of wood. It looks like a small finger. It goes from the belly to the back. The soundpost is also held in place by the strings. In the middle of the belly there are two long, curved holes. They are called “f holes”. This is because of their shape. The top of the strings are wound around pegs.  The violin can be [[wikt:tune#Verb|tuned]] by turning the pegs. The very top of the neck is called the scroll. Violins today also have a [[chinrest]]. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A [[shoulder rest]] can also be used. These are now made of foam. They have special legs to hold them on to the violin.  Many beginners prefer to use a [[sponge]] and an elastic band instead. 
 
 To make it easier to tune the violin, many people find it helpful to have “adjusters” for “fine tuning” when the string is only slightly out of tune.  These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece.  They stop the strings from slipping when being tuned. 
 
 Strings used to be made of [[gut]]. They are now mostly made of [[steel]] or [[nylon]]. Adjusters can only be used with some strings. The front of the violin body is made of [[spruce]]. The back and sides of the body are made of [[maple]]. The bow can be made of several kinds of wood. An example would be [[Brazilwood|pernambuco]]. Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre. The bow is strung with horsehair (horsehair is hair that comes from the back of the horse's head also known as the mane or from the horse's [[tail]]). 
 
 == Playing == 
 {{Unsourced section|date=September 2020}} 
 It takes years of practice to become a good violinist.  A beginner will start with pieces and or exercises that do not require precise or complicated technique in right or left hand.  Some examples of pieces that do not require great technique are ''Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'' by Mozart, ''Children's Song'' (A German folk tune), and ''Over the Rainbow''.  During these  " simple "  songs, the violinist will develop fundamental skills necessary for all other techniques, such as proper bow and violin holding.  As the musician develops more and more confidence and skill in both left and right hand, pieces and exercises will become progressively more difficult.  When necessary, they will also learn techniques and skills that will enhance their playing.  Vibrato, smooth bow changes in the right hand, and shifting. 
 
 The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is “in tune”. This is called [[intonation (music)|intonation]]. The musician will also learn [[vibrato]]. This changes the intonation of each note slightly by making it a little bit sharper (higher), then a little bit flatter (lower), producing a kind of wobble. This is important in many styles of music to create [[mood]]. 
 
 Besides plucking ([[pizzicato]]), there are many special effects. Some of them are [[glissando]], [[portamento]], and [[harmonics]]. There is also [[double stopping]], [[chord]]s, and [[scordatura]] tuning. 
 
 The violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands. When playing in chamber music or in orchestras the violinist sits, but this was not always the case. When sitting, the violinist may have to turn his or her right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow.

 In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[composer]]s wrote a lot of music for solo violin. Many of these composers were from [[Italy]]. They were themselves violinists. Some of these violinists are [[Corelli]], Vitali, [[Vivaldi]], Veracini, Geminiani, Locatelli and Tartini. 
 In [[Germany]], [[Schmelzer]] and Biber wrote some very [[virtuoso]] violin music. Later, in the early 18th century, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Handel]] wrote many masterpieces for the violin. 
 
 In the [[Classical music period]], the great composers [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]] all wrote solo works for the violin. They also wrote a large amount of [[chamber music]], especially [[string quartet]]s.{{cn}} 
 
 In the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]] many virtuoso violin works were written.{{cn}} These include [[concerto]]s by [[Mendelssohn]], [[Saint-Saëns]], [[Brahms]], [[Max Bruch|Bruch]], Wieniawski, [[Tchaikovsky]], and [[Dvořák]].{{cn}} In the 20th century, many virtuoso works were written. These include [[Elgar]], [[Sibelius]], Szymanowski, [[Bartók]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Prokofiev]], [[Shostakovich]], [[Hindemith]], and Penderecki. In the 19th century, [[Niccolò Paganini]] was the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anything that had been written before.{{cn}} People compared him to the [[devil]] because he could play so [[wikt:brilliant|brilliantly]] and because he looked thin and moved his body about in strange ways. < ref > " The Violin and Viola "  by Sheila Nelson, {{ISBN|0-510-36651-1}} p.143 < /ref > 
 
 In recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing. [[Stéphane Grappelli]] was especially famous for this. 
 
 == Famous violinists == 
 Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are [[Fritz Kreisler]], [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[David Oistrakh]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Ida Haendel]], and [[Isaac Stern]]. Today some of the greatest players include [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Maxim Vengerov]], [[Vadim Repin]], [[Nigel Kennedy]], [[Hilary Hahn]], [[Joshua Bell]] and fiddler [[Sara Watkins]].
