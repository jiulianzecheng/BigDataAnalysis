 The Kingdom of '''Northumbria''' ({{lang-ang|Norþhymbra rīce}}), was a [[middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom of the [[Angles]], in what is now northern [[England]] and south-east [[Scotland]]. It later became an [[earl]]dom in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Kingdom of England]]. The name reflects the southern limit to the kingdom's territory, the [[River Humber]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Northumbria was formed in the  early [[7th century]] by [[Athelfrith of Bernicia|Athelfrith]], King of [[Bernicia]]. < ref name=Higham1 > N. J. Higham, ''The Kingdom of Northumbria; AD 350–1100'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Sutton Publishing, 1993), p. 1 < /ref >   He conquered the kingdom of [[Deira]] and several [[Britain|British]] kingdoms and combined them under his rule. < ref > Barbara Yorke, ''Kings and Kingship in Early Anglo-Saxon England'' (London: Seaby, 1990), p. 77 < /ref >  The kingdom of Northumbria also included [[Lindsey (kingdom)|Lindsey]] at times. Northumbria was a part of the [[Heptarchy]] of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms. < ref > D. P. Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', Second Edition (London; New York: Routledge, 2000), p. 4 < /ref >  At its greatest the kingdom extended at least from just south of the Humber river, to the [[River Mersey]] and to the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] (roughly, [[Sheffield]] to [[Runcorn]] to [[Edinburgh]]). The name 'Northumbria' wasn't in common use until the time of Ecgfrith, King of Northumbria. < ref name=Higham1/ >  The name is first used in the [[preamble]] to the council of Hatfield (680). < ref name=Higham1/ >  Ecgfrith was described as king of the Humberfolk'. After the loss of [[Lindsey (kingdom)]] which was south of the [[River Humber]], the name became Northumbria in [[Latin language|Latin]] is ''Northanhymbrenis.'' It comes from the [[Old English]] ''be northan Hymbre'' meaning 'to the north of the Humber'. < ref > John Marsden, ''Northanhymbre Saga; The History of the Anglo-Saxon Kings of Northumbria'' (London: Kyle Cathie Limited, 1992), p. 7 < /ref >  The name Northumbria was still used during the reigns of Kings [[Canute]] and [[Edward the Confessor]]. < ref name=Higham1/ >  [[William the Conqueror]] broke up Northumbria into several parts. < ref > David W. Rollason, ''Northumbria, 500-1100: Creation and Destruction of a Kingdom'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 267 < /ref >  [[Yorkshire]] became the new name for the heartlands of the former kingdom. < ref name=Higham1/ > 
 
 == Earldom == 
 
 Northumbria became an earldom when the southern part of Northumbria (which had been Deira) was lost to the [[Danelaw]]. < ref > David W. Rollason, ''Northumbria, 500-1100: Creation and Destruction of a Kingdom'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 257 < /ref >  The northern part (which had been Bernicia) was a kingdom for a short time but under the Danish kingdom it also became an earldom. Some of this land was claimed by both England and Scotland. The Earldom of Northumbria was later a part of England by the Anglo-Scottish [[Treaty of York]] in 1237. On the northern border, [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], which is north of the Tweed but had changed hands many times, was defined as subject to the laws of England by the [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]]. The land once part of Northumbria at its peak is now divided by modern administrative boundaries: 
 
 * [[North East England]] includes [[Angles|Anglian]] [[Bernicia]] 
 * [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] includes [[Angles|Anglian]] [[Deira]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Elmet]] 
 * [[North West England]] includes [[Cumbria]] 
 * [[Scottish Borders]], [[West Lothian]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Midlothian]] and [[East Lothian]] cover the extreme north
