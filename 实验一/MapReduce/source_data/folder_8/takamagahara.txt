'''Takama-ga-hara''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 高天原), [[literal translation|literally]]  " High Heaven's [[Plain]] "  but usually translated as the  " High Plain of Heaven, "  is a place in [[Japanese mythology]]. In [[Shinto]], Takama-ga-hara is the place where the [[Kami]] live. The legends say it's connected to the Earth by the [[bridge]] ''Ama-no uki-hashi'' (the  " Floating Bridge of Heaven " ). In Shinto, when a kami is [[worship]]ped, it is [[wikt:invitation|invited]] to leave Takama-ga-hara and enter a [[jinja|shrine]].
