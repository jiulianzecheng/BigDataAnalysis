A '''hyperaccumulator''' is a [[plant]] that can grow in [[soil]]s with very high concentrations of [[metals]]. < ref name=flav/ >

 The advantage of hyperaccumulation of metals may be that the [[toxic]] levels of [[heavy metals]] in [[leaves]] deter [[herbivores]] ([[defence against herbivory]]). 
 
 Several gene families are involved in hyperaccumulation including absorbing and storing heavy metals. < ref name=flav/ >  The genes most usually involved are the ZIP gene family. These genes code for membrane receptors for the transport of, for example, [[zinc]] molecules. 
 
 These hyperaccumulation genes (HA genes) are found in over 450 plant species, including the [[model organism]]s ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' and the [[Brassicaceae]].  Expression of HA genes allows the plant to uptake and sequester metals such as [[As]], [[Co]], [[Fe]], [[Cu]], [[Cd]], [[Pb]], [[Hg]], [[Se]], [[Mn]], [[Zn]], [[Mo]] and [[Ni]] in 100–1000 times the concentration found in sister species or populations. < ref > C.
