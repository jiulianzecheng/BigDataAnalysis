 '''Archosaurs''' are a large group of reptiles, including all [[crocodile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, and [[pterosaur]]s (flying reptiles). There are also a number of smaller [[extinct]] groups, mostly from the [[Triassic]] period. < ref > Benton M. 1990. ''The reign of the reptiles''. Crescent, N.Y. < /ref > 
 
 The Archosaurs are definitely a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]], and do not include reptiles such as the [[Squamata]] (lizards and snakes) and the Sphenodontia (''[[Sphenodon]]''). < ref name=Archo > Brusatte, Stephen L.

 * [[Teeth]] set in [[wikt:socket|sockets]], which makes them less likely to be torn loose during feeding. Some archosaurs, such as birds, are secondarily toothless. 
 * Openings in the [[skull]] in front of the eyes, but behind the [[nostril]]s. The openings reduce the weight of the skull. 
 * Small openings in the [[jaw]] bones reduce the weight of the jaw slightly. 
 * Legs held under the body rather than sprawled, or ''may'' be held under the body. This improves both [[breathing]] and movement. 
 ** A special ridge for attaching [[muscle]]s to the [[femur]]. This detail may have made it possible for dinosaurs to stand on two legs. All early dinosaurs and many later ones were [[bipedal]]. Obviously birds are bipedal; only the large herbivore dinosaurs went back to walking on four legs. 
 
 The archosaurs or their immediate ancestors survived the catastrophic [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]. Benton comments:  " The key tetrapods to benefit from the Permo-Triassic mass extinction was the Archosauromorpha " . < ref > Benton M.J. 2015. ''Vertebrate paleontology''. 4th ed, Blackwell, Oxford: Evolution of the Archosauromorphs, p154. < /ref >  Then, in the early and middle Triassic, there was rapid evolution into the types of aquatic and land [[tetrapods]] which dominated the rest of the [[Mesozoic era]]. 
 
 ==Archosaur classification== 
 [[Clade]]s: 
 * [[Avemetatarsalia]] 
 ** †[[Pterosaur]]ia 
 ** [[Dinosaur]]ia 
 * [[Crurotarsi]] or [[Pseudosuchia]]: The crocodile line of [[crown-group]] Archosauria 
 ** †[[Phytosaur]]ia: semi-aquatic long-snouted types 
 ** †[[Aetosaur]]ia: quadrupedal armoured herbivores 
 ** †[[Ornithosuchidae]]: look rather like dinosaurs 
 ** [[Crocodylomorpha]] ([[Crocodilia]] and their ancestors) 
 ** †[[Rauisuchia]] ? uncertain group, includes some large-bodied [[quadruped]]al predators 
 
 ==Archosauromorpha== 
 This is an even wider group, which includes [[diapsid]] [[Sauropsida]] which appeared in the middle [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] periods. Their relationships are not well established at present.
