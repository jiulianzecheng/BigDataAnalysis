 '''Cornrows''' (sometimes called '''canerows''') are a [[hairstyle]].  They are [[braid]]s with the hair braided very close to the [[scalp|skin of the head]]. The braids are made with an underhand, upward motion. This makes a raised row. Cornrows usually have simple, straight lines, like the rows of [[maize|corn]] in a cornfield, but they can have patterns instead. 
 
 Cornrows can have beads, cuffs, or [[cowrie]] shells in them.  It can take hours to make a cornrow hairstyle. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://africanamericanhairstyling.com/cornrow-braid-styles/ |title=Cornrow Braid Styles |publisher=Africanamericanhairstyling |access-date=2018-08-11 |archive-date=2018-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726195243/http://africanamericanhairstyling.com/cornrow-braid-styles/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Cornrows can stay in for weeks if the person washes their head well.  Cornrows are also a [[protective hairstyle]]: People with African hair wear them to help their hair grow without breaking.  However, if the braids are too tight, kept in for too long, or put in hair that can't keep them, the hair might fall out.  This is called [[traction alopecia]]. < ref > {{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6961935.stm | work=BBC News | title=Braiding 'can lead to hair loss' | date=2007-08-24 | access-date=2010-04-30}} < /ref > 
 
 Over the centuries, people from many parts of the world have put their hair in cornrows. In the 20th and 21st centuries, cornrows are more common in people with African ancestors. This has led to accusations of [[racism]] and [[discrimination]] and to laws about cornrows and other protective hairstyles.

 In Africa, especially the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[West Africa]], women put their hair in cornrows. Men wear cornrows too.  [[Ancient Greek sculpture]] and artwork from the 5th century b.c.e. shows men warriors and heroes wearing cornrows. Artwork and statues from the Middle East and Mediterranean from the 3rd and 4th century b.c.e. also show cornrows were common. Men in 19th century [[Ethiopia]] wore cornrows: where warriors and kings such as [[Tewodros II]] and [[Yohannes IV]] were shown wearing cornrows.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

 Cornrow hairstyles in Africa also cover a wide social terrain: religion, kinship, status, age, racial diversity, and other attributes of identity can all be expressed in hairstyle. Just as important is the act of braiding, which passes on cultural values between generations, expresses bonds between friends, and establishes the role of professional practitioner. < ref > {{cite web |title=History of Cornrow Braiding: African Origins 1.b |url=http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/cornrow_curves/culture/african.origins.1.a.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623170048/http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/cornrow_curves/culture/african.origins.1.a.htm |archive-date=2015-06-23 |access-date=2015-06-20 |publisher=Csdt.rpi.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 Cornrows became common again in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s and again during the 1990s and 2000s. In the 2000s, some athletes wore cornrows, including NBA basketball players [[Allen Iverson]], [[Rasheed Wallace]], and [[Latrell Sprewell]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite book |author=Sherrow, Victoria |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher |title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofha0000sher/page/97 97] |isbn=9780313331459 |url-access=registration}} < /ref >

 In 2011, the [[High Court]] of the United Kingdom, saw a [[test case (law)|test case]]. The Court said a school's decision stop students with cornrows from entering the school was wrong. The court ruled said the student wearing cornrows could keep wearing them because it was his cultural tradition. The court said that it was sometimes all right for schools to make rules against hairstyles. For example, they said schools could forbid [[skinhead]] gangs' shaved heads. < ref > {{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/school-braids-ban-not-justified-2298925.htm | work=The Independent | title=School braids ban 'not justified' | date=2011-06-17 | access-date=2011-06-17}} < /ref >
