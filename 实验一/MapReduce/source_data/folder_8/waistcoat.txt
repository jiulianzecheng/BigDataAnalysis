 A '''waistcoat''' (known as a '''vest''' in the United States) is a sleeveless upper-body [[garment]]. It is worn over a [[dress shirt]] and [[necktie]], and below a [[jacket|coat]] as a part of most men's [[formal wear]]. It is the third piece of the three-piece male [[Suit (clothing)|suit]]. < ref name= " Gavenas " > {{cite book |last=Gavenas|first=Mary Lisa|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Menswear|url=https://archive.org/details/fairchildencyclo0000gave|page=[https://archive.org/details/fairchildencyclo0000gave/page/379 379]|publisher=Fairchild|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56367-465-5}} < /ref > 
 
 The waistcoat has quite a long history, going back to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. It was derived from the Persian vests seen by English visitors to the court of [[Shah Abbas]].  
 
 As an item of clothing, the waistcoat has the advantage that if the jacket is taken off indoors, the outfit still keeps a degree of formality.
