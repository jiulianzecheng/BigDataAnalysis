 A '''delicatessen''' is a shop that sells prepared foods of high quality to retail customers (shoppers). Typical products are [[cheese]]s, smoked fish, and cured meats,  " delicacies "  that have a long shelf life. The foods requiring refrigeration are kept in and sold from a cold case, or as canned foods on shelves.  
 
 Neighborhood delicatessens often feature ethnic foods for immigrant and second-generation patrons.
