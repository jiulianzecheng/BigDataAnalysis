 '''Guineafowls''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|n|i|f|aʊ|l}}; sometimes called  " pet speckled hens "  or  " original fowl " ) are [[bird]]s of the family '''Numididae''' in the order [[Galliformes]]. They are endemic to  [[Africa]] and rank among the oldest of the gallinaceous birds. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetically]], they branched off from the core Galliformes after the [[Cracidae]] (chachalacas, guans, and curassows) and before the Odontophoridae ([[New World quail]]).  An [[Eocene]] [[fossil]] lineage ''Telecrex'' has been associated with guineafowl; ''Telecrex'' inhabited [[Mongolia]], and may have given rise to the oldest of the true [[Phasianidae|phasianids]], such as [[blood pheasant]]s and [[Crossoptilon|eared pheasants]], which [[Evolution|evolved]] into high-altitude, montane-adapted species with the rise of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].  While modern guineafowl species are endemic to Africa, the [[helmeted guineafowl]] has been [[Introduced species|introduced]] as a domesticated bird widely elsewhere. < ref name =  " Lever "  / >

 ==Description== 
 The [[insect]]- and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds of this family resemble [[partridge]]s, but with featherless heads, though both members of the genus ''Guttera'' have a distinctive black [[Crest (feathers)|crest]], and the vulturine guineafowl has a downy brown patch on the nape. Most species of guineafowl have a dark grey or blackish [[plumage]] < ref name= " Cub Creek Science and Animal Camp " > {{cite web | title=Guinea Fowl - Missouri | website=Cub Creek Science and Animal Camp | url=http://www.mosciencecamp.com/animals/meet-our-animals/birds/guinea-fowl/ | access-date=2018-10-20 | archive-date=2018-10-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020224024/http://www.mosciencecamp.com/animals/meet-our-animals/birds/guinea-fowl/ | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  with dense white spots, but both members of the genus ''Agelastes'' lack the spots. While several species are relatively well known, the plumed guineafowl and the two members of the genus ''Agelastes'' remain relatively poorly known. These large birds measure from 40–71 & nbsp;cm (16–28 & nbsp;in) in length, and weigh 700–1600 & nbsp;g or 1.5-3.5 & nbsp;lb. Guinea hens weigh more than guinea cocks, possibly because of the larger reproductive organs in the female compared to the male guinea fowl. Also, the presence of relatively larger egg clusters in the dual-purpose guinea hens may be a factor that contributes to the higher body weight of the guinea hens. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://rumble.com/v2zu7j-penny-the-silky-bantom-with-her-two-foster-guinea-fowl.-they-still-love-her.html|title=Penny the Silkie Bantam with her two foster Guinea Fowls|last=RossHeywood|website=Rumble}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Behavior and ecology== 
 The species for which information is known are normally [[monogamous]], mating for life, or are serially [[monogamy|monogamous]]; however, occasional exceptions have been recorded for helmeted and Kenya crested guineafowl, which have been reported to be [[polygamy|polygamous]] in captivity. < ref > (Madge and McGowan, p. 345–352) < /ref >  All guineafowl are social, and typically live in small groups or large flocks. Though they are monogamous, species of the least-derived genera ''[[Guttera]]'', ''[[Agelastes]]'', and ''[[Acryllium]]'' tend toward social [[polyandry]], a trait shared with other primitive galliforms such as the [[crested partridge]] and [[Congo peafowl]]. 
 
 Guineafowl travel behind herd animals and beneath [[monkey]] troups, where they forage within manure and on items that have fallen to the [[understory]] from the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]. They play a pivotal role in the control of [[tick]]s, [[fly|flies]], [[locust]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and other [[invertebrates]]. They pluck [[maggot]]s from carcasses and manure. 
 
 Wild guineafowl are strong flyers. Their breast muscles are dark (aerobic metabolism), enabling them to sustain themselves in flight for considerable distances if hard-pressed. Grass and bush fires are a constant threat to them and flight is the most effective means of escape. 
 
 Some species of guineafowl, like the vulturine guineafowl, may go without drinking water for extended periods, instead sourcing their moisture from their food. Young guineafowl (called keets) are very sensitive to weather, in particular cold temperatures. 
 
 Guinea hens are not known to be good mothers, < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-05-08|title=Are Guinea Hens the Worst Moms of All?|url=https://backyardpoultry.iamcountryside.com/poultry-101/are-guinea-hens-the-worst-moms/|access-date=2019-11-20|website=Backyard Poultry|language=en-US}} < /ref >  but in the wild, the guinea hen's mate (a guinea cock) may help tend the young keets during the day by keeping them warm and finding food.  Sometimes, more than one cock helps raise the young.  Guineafowl (hens and cocks together) make good parents.  During warm weather, the cock is unlikely to set on the keets during the night (leaving that duty to the hen), but may help the hen keep them warm at night when temperatures drop below freezing. 
 
 Guineafowl may be trained to go into a coop (instead of roosting in trees) when very young. Once hatched and ready to leave the brooder (around 3 weeks), they may be enclosed in a coop for at least three days so they learn where  " home "  is. When guinea parents (that already roost in a coop) raise their own keets, the hen sets on them outdoors at night, but then the parents teach the keets to also go into the coop in the evenings around 3 weeks of age. 
 
 Each sex has a different call, which can be used to differentiate between female and male. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.thehappychickencoop.com/guinea-hen/|title=Guinea Hen: All You Need To Know (Complete Care Guide)|website=www.thehappychickencoop.com|date=27 August 2021}} < /ref >   Unlike chickens (which generally do best with one rooster for a flock of hens), < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.mypetchicken.com/backyard-chickens/chicken-help/How-many-roosters-can-I-have-H154.aspx|title=How many roosters can I have?from My Pet Chicken|website=My Pet Chicken|access-date=2019-11-20}} < /ref >  guinea fowl do well with one cock for each hen. 
 
 ==Distribution and habitat== 
 Guineafowl species are found across [[sub-Saharan Africa]], some almost in the entire range, others more localized, such as the [[plumed guineafowl]] in west-central Africa and the [[vulturine guineafowl]] in north-east Africa. They live in semiopen habitats such as [[savanna]] or [[semidesert]]s, while some, such as the [[black guineafowl]], mainly inhabit forests. Some perch high on treetops. 
 
 The helmeted guineafowl has been introduced in [[East Africa]], the [[West Indies]], the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[India]], where it is raised as food or pets. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://modernfarmer.com/2014/10/get-watch-bird/|title=Guinea Fowl: Your Overlooked Backyard Buddy - Modern Farmer|date=15 October 2014|website=modernfarmer.com|access-date=27 March 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Guineafowl as food== 
 Guineafowl meat is drier and leaner than [[chicken meat]] and has a gamey flavour. It has marginally more protein than chicken or [[Turkey meat|turkey]], roughly half the fat of chicken and slightly fewer calories per gram. < ref > USDA handbook #8 and circular #549, leclercq 1985 < /ref >  Their eggs are substantially richer than those of chickens. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Guinea Fowl Production|url=http://www.gov.bw/Global/MOA/Guinea%20Fowl%20Production.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701172947/http://www.gov.bw/Global/MOA/Guinea%20Fowl%20Production.pdf|archive-date=2015-07-01|access-date=2014-11-06}} < /ref >
