 A '''baker''' is somebody who makes mainly [[bread]]. Some bakers also make [[cake]]s and [[dessert]]s, but a [[traditional]] baker only makes bread. The place where a baker works is called a bakehouse or a bakery. 
 
 The first bread was made by the Egyptians in 8000 BC and in the [[Middle Ages]] most [[landlord]]s had a bakery. They had a public [[oven]] and [[Housewife|housewives]] brought the [[dough]] to the baker to cook. 
 
 Bread is now much sweeter than it was in the Middle Ages because a lot of [[corn syrup]] or [[honey]] is used.
