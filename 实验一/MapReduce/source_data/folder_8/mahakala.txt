 '''''Mahakala'''''  < ref > from [[Sanskrit]], named after one of eight protector deities (dharmapalas) in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] < /ref >  is a [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of  80 million years ago.  
 
 It is based on a partial [[skeleton]] found in the [[Gobi Desert]], [[Mongolia]].  
 
 ''Mahakala'' was a small dromaeosaur, about 70 centimeters long (28 in). Its skeleton shows some features which are also found in early [[troodontidae|troodontids]] and [[avialae|avialans]]. However, its short forearms rule it out of the Alialae. 
 
 Despite its late appearance, its structure is that of a basal dromaeosaur. Its small size, and the small size of other basal [[deinonychosauria]], suggests that small size came before flight in [[bird]]s. 
 
 ==Description== 
 [[File:Mahakala omnogovae.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Life restoration.]] 
 [[File:Mahakala omnogovae SIZE.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Size of ''Mahakala'' compared to a human.]] 
 Although this individual was small, comparable in size to ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', ''[[Caudipteryx]]'', and ''[[Mei (dinosaur)|Mei]]'', it was close to adulthood.   
 
 This genus can be distinguished from other [[paraves|paravians]] (dromaeosaurs, troodonts, and birds) by details of the [[ulna]], [[femur|thighbone]], [[ilium]], and tail vertebrae. 
 
 It had a typical dromaeosaurid form of the second toe, with an expanded claw. < ref name=AHTetal07 > {{Cite journal |last=Turner |first=Alan H. |others= Pol, Diego; Clarke, Julia A.; Erickson, Gregory M.; and Norell, Mark |year=2007 |title=A basal dromaeosaurid and size evolution preceding avian flight  |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/317/5843/1378.pdf |journal=Science |volume=317 |pages=1378–1381 |doi= 10.1126/science.1144066 |pmid=17823350 |issue= 5843 |bibcode=2007Sci...317.1378T |s2cid=2519726 }} < /ref >  ''Mahakala'' also had very short forelimbs compared to other Dromaeosaurs. 
 
 ==Classification== 
 A [[cladistics|phylogenetic analysis]] performed by Turner and colleagues, who described the specimen, found ''Mahakala'' to be the most basal known dromaeosaur. Their results, along with the small size of other [[theropod]]s found at the base of [[Paraves|paravian]] lineages, suggest that small size was not an innovation of early birds, but a common trait of early paravians. 
 
 In [[evolution]], small size would have come before flight. Like birds, troodonts and dromaeosaurs did not keep small size throughout their evolutionary history. They had several separate size increases among different lineages.  
 
 ''Mahakala'' also shows a combination of characteristics found among basal troodonts and birds, and is missing some that are present in more derived (specialised) dromaeosaurs. < ref name=AHTetal07/ > 
 
 ==Paleoecology and paleobiology== 
 The paleo[[environment]] had a semi[[arid]] climate, with [[dune|sand dune]]s and [[alluvium]] (loose stuff). The semiarid [[steppe]] landscape was drained by [[stream]]s after rain, and was affected by dust and [[sand]]storms. [[Rainfall]] was low, and seasonal.   
 
 Animals present included terrestrial [[turtle]]s and [[crocodilia]]ns, [[lizard]]s, [[mammal]]s, and a variety of dinosaurs; [[aquatic]] animals like [[fish]] were not present.  The majority of the [[fauna]] was small to medium-sized. < ref name= " TJ97 " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediadino00curr_075|title=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs|last=Jerzykiewicz|first=Tom|publisher=Academic Press|year=1997|isbn=0-12-226810-5|editor=Currie, Phillip J.|location=San Diego|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediadino00curr_075/page/188 188]–191|chapter=Djadokhta Formation|editor-last2=Padian, Kevin}} < /ref >
