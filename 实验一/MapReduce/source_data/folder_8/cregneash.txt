 '''Cregneash''' is a small [[village]] and tourist destination in the very south-west of the [[Isle of Man]]. It is about {{convert|2|km|abbr=off}} from Port Erin. Most of the village is now part of the Manx National Heritage. There are also a small number of private homes in the village, but they are made to maintain an older traditional look. The village speaks the [[Manx language]]. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|title=Cregneash â€“ Creneash|url=https://manxnationalheritage.im/our-sites/cregneash/|access-date=6 August 2020|website=Manx National Heritage}} < /ref >
