A '''monarch''' is the ruler of a [[country]] which is a [[monarchy]]. Monarchs usually get their power by [[inheritance]] from one of their parents. When a monarch dies, a child or the nearest relative takes over. A [[male]] monarch is usually called a [[king]] or [[emperor]]. A female monarch is usually called a [[queen]] or [[empress]]. 
 
 Monarchs were very common in [[history]] until the 20th century. Most [[Europe|European]] countries had monarchs in past centuries, but most no longer have them. Some countries that still have monarchs have other [[leader]]s with the actual power. Most monarchies are [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]]. Some countries, however, elect their monarch, instead of using inheritance, like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] < ref > {{Cite web|title=the Holy Roman Empire|url=https://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/hre.htm#Qualifications|access-date=2021-04-23|website=www.heraldica.org}} < /ref >  and [[Malaysia]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-08-03|title=Explained: Malaysia is the world's only monarchy of its kind. Here's why|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-malaysia-is-the-worlds-only-monarchy-of-its-kind-heres-why-5874995/|access-date=2021-04-23|website=The Indian Express|language=en}} < /ref >  Some [[republic]]s, such as the [[Dutch Republic]] or [[North Korea]], had or have a hereditary ruler but do not call him a  " monarch " . 
 
 Monarchs can also have monarchs of lower honour below them. For example, an [[empire]] could include several [[kingdom]]s, and a kingdom could have several [[duchy|duchies]] or [[principality|principalities]]. Nations would rarely include all [[title]]s and usually go from [[duchy]] to kingdom instead of duchy to principality to kingdom.  " [[Prince]] "  and  "  [[princess]] "  are words that mean  " ruler of a principality "  and/or  " son of a king/queen. "  Some languages have separate words for them.
