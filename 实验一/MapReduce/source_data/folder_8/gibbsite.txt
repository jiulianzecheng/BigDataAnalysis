 '''Gibbsite''', Al(OH) < sub > 3 < /sub > , is one of the [[mineral]] forms of [[aluminium hydroxide]]. It is often designated as γ-Al(OH) < sub > 3 < /sub >  (but sometimes as α-Al(OH) < sub > 3 < /sub > ). < ref > N.N. Greenwood and A. Earnshaw,  " Chemistry of Elements " , 2nd edition, Butterworth and Heinemann, 1997 < /ref >  It is also sometimes called '''hydrargillite''' (or '''hydrargyllite'''). It is an important [[ore]] of [[aluminium]], and one of the main parts of the rock [[Bauxite]].
