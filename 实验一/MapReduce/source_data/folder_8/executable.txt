 An '''executable''' is a [[computer program]] written by a [[programmer]] and compiled by a [[compiler]] (See [[programming]]). When it is run, it 'executes' (or does) the [[action]]s it was programmed to.   
 
 An example of a compiler is the [[GNU C Compiler]], or GCC for short.  It reads in program code written in the [[C programming language]], and converts it into [[binary]] [[machine code]] called an executable, so computers can understand it. On [[Microsoft Windows]], these files end with '.exe.' To humans, these files are hard to read. [[Mac OS X|Mac]]s use other [[file extension]]s.
