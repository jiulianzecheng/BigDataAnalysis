 In ancient [[Egypt]]ian mythology, '''Tawaret''' (also ''Taweret) ''was the demon-wife of [[Apep]], the first god of evil. She was often shown as a [[hippopotamus]]. Because female hippos are aggressive to protect their young, pregnant women wore [[amulet]]s of Tawaret to protect their pregnancies. 
 
 Tawaret was a very popular goddess in the first Dynasty. She was, overall, the goddess who protected women during childbirth and pregnancy. In ancient Egypt, it was believed that if you wanted to live through childbirth it was necessary to pray to Tawaret.
