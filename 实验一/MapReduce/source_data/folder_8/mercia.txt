 '''Mercia''' was one of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[:wikt:kingdoms|kingdoms]] of the [[Heptarchy]]. It was in the region now known as the [[England|English]] [[Midlands]] now East Midlands  &  West Midlands. Mercia was centered on the valley of the [[River Trent]] and its [[tributary|tributaries]]. Settled by [[Angles]], their name is the root of the name 'England'. Their neighbors included other Angles, [[Saxons]] and [[:en:wikt:Jutes|Jutes]] all from Germany.{{efn|For the year '''An.CCCC.XLIX''' (AD 549) The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] reported:  " ...Then came men from three tribes of Germany: from the Old-Saxons, from the Angles, from the Jutes. " < ref > Benjamin Thorpe, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' (London: Longman, Green, Longman  &  Roberts, 1861), p. 11, year 549 < /ref >  Bede also writes (in the year of our Lord 449) of three longships of Angles invited to Britain by King Vortigern. They were given lands in the eastern parts as payment for their protection. Soon a larger fleet came over with great numbers of warriors. < ref > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley-Price; D. H. Farmer, revis. R.R. Latham (London, New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 62 < /ref >  Bede goes on to say that great hordes began to crowd the island and that the native Britons began to live in terror. Also, that the pagan invaders were  " God's just punishment on the sins of the nation. " < ref name=Bede63 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley-Price; D. H. Farmer, revis. R.R. Latham (London, New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 63 < /ref >  The Angles, Saxons and Jutes came to Britain at a time when history was not being recorded. Beyond what little there is, the history of this period is remembered by fragments of information. Their proper placement in time can be off by decades rather than just years. < ref > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 2 < /ref > }} Mercia bordered on  [[Northumbria]], [[Wessex]], [[Sussex]], [[Essex]] and [[East Anglia]]. To the west were Britons in [[Powys]] and the kingdoms of southern [[Wales]]. Its capital was [[Tamworth]], which is today part of [[Staffordshire]]. 
 
 == Early history == 
 
 [[:wikt:archaeological|Archaeological]] discoveries show the first [[:en:wikt:Anglian|Anglian]] settlements were in the [[River Trent|Trent river]] valley. < ref name=Brown147 > ''Mercia: An Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe'', eds. Michelle P Brown; Carol A Farr (London: Continuum International Pub. Group, 2005), p. 147 < /ref >  The original kingdom of Mercia had a variety of different kinds of land. Most of it would not have been the first choice of anyone wishing to settle there. Not if better land was available elsewhere. < ref > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 42 < /ref >  The name 'Mercia' comes from the tribal name ''Mierce'', which means 'boundary folk.' < ref name=Stenton40 > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 40 < /ref >  It was probably a name already known in the English midlands and was adopted by the Angles who settled there. < ref name=Stenton40/ >  The Angles, according to [[Bede]], came from ''Angulus'' in northern [[Germany]]. < ref name=Bede63/ >  They were of the same stock as the East Anglians and the Northumbrians. < ref > John Cannon; Ralph Griffiths, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 6 < /ref >  The invasion of England by the Germanic tribes was relatively quick. By {{circa|650}} England was a large collection of small kingdoms each having a [[warlord]] or petty [[king]]. < ref name=Cannon8 > John Cannon; Ralph Griffiths, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 8 < /ref >  Within 200 years of their arrival in England, the late [[7th century|seventh century]], emerged the Heptarchy: the seven kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England. < ref name=Cannon8/ >  Mercia was the dominant power among the Anglo-Saxons from the middle of the seventh century to the early [[9th Century|ninth century]]. < ref > ''Mercia: An Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe'', eds. Michelle P Brown; Carol A Farr (London: Continuum International Pub. Group, 2005), p. 2 < /ref >  Several Mercian [[Nobility|noblewomen]] played an important role in Mercian affairs. < ref > ''Mercia: An Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe'', eds. Michelle P Brown; Carol A Farr (London: Continuum International Pub. Group, 2005), p. 3 < /ref >  This is in [[:wikt:contrast|contrast]] to Wessex where women rarely had an active role in the government. < ref > Pauline Stafford, 'The King's Wife in Wessex 800-1066', ''Past  &  Present'', No. 91 (May, 1981), p. 4 < /ref >  During the seventh and [[8th century|eighth centuries]] Mercia struggled mainly with Northumbria. < ref name=HEFG282 > ''Histories of England, France, Germany, and Holland from the Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (New York: Scribner, 1883), p. 282 < /ref >  By the ninth century Wessex was the dominant power in the region. < ref name=HEFG282/ >  King [[Egbert]] of Wessex (802–839) was the overlord and for the first time passed this position down to his heirs. < ref name=HEFG282/ >  From this time on until they ceased to exist as a kingdom, Mercia was a [[:wikt:vassal|vassal]] kingdom to Wessex. In the last quarter of the ninth century Mercia lost much of its territory in the midlands to Danish settlers. < ref name=Brown147/ > 
 
 [[Christianity]] was introduced into Mercia in the 650s. < ref name=Collins189 > Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Europe; 300–1000'', Second Edition (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 189 < /ref >  The first monks were [[Irish people|Irish]] followed by Northumbrians. By 653 a single [[:en:wikt:bishopric|bishopric]] was established and a series of Irish trained [[bishop]]s followed. < ref name=Collins189/ >  In 674 a second [[:wikt:diocese|diocese]] was established for eastern Mercia. < ref name=Collins189/ > 
 
 == Notable kings == 
 
 '''Penda''' ({{circa|626}}–655) was a [[wikt:pagan|pagan]] [[List of monarchs of Mercia|king of Mercia]]. < ref name=Collins187 > Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Europe; 300–1000'', Second Edition (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 187 < /ref >  He was able to put together a [[:en:wikt:confederacy|confederacy]] of a number of smaller kingdoms and from that he created Mercia. < ref name=Collins187/ >  But in the 630s he was not able to compete with the larger Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that were around his. Northumberland was threatening to expand into the territory of Mercia. Penda found it convenient to ally with [[Gwynedd]], the dominant British kingdom to the west. < ref name=Collins187/ >  It was an unusual cooperation between Christians and pagans, but it worked. Together they defeated the Northumbrian king, Edwin, who died at the battle of Hatfield Chase. < ref name=Collins187/ > 
 
 '''Athelred I''' (675–716) was the third of Penda's sons to be king of Mercia. < ref name=Cannon46 > John Cannon; Anne Hargreaves, ''Oxford The Kings and Queens of Britain'' (Oxford; New York: The Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 46 < /ref >  He ravaged Kent to prevent them from breaking away from his rule.

He was [[:en:wikt:abbot|abbot]] of the monastery of Bardsey and appears to have died about 716. < ref name=Cannon46/ > 
 
 '''[[Offa of Mercia|Offa]]''' (757–796), was the first of the Anglo-Saxon kings who might rightly be called  " king of the English " . < ref name=Ashley257 > Mike Ashley, ''The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens'' (New york: Carroll  &  Graf, 1999), p. 257 < /ref >  He was the son of Thingfrith, the brother of Penda. < ref name=Ashley257/ >  He struggled to gain control of Mercia having come to power just after a [[civil war]]. < ref name=Ashley257/ >  But he proved to be ruthless, bold and creative in bringing Kent, Sussex and Essex under his control. < ref name=CannonGriffiths26 > John Cannon; Ralph Griffiths, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 26 < /ref >  Offa had diplomatic relations with [[Charlemagne]]. He was one of the few Anglo-Saxon monarchs to have dealings with continental rulers. < ref name=Collins192 > Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Europe; 300–1000'', Second Edition (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 192 < /ref >  Letters and presents were exchanged. But when Offa sought a marriage of his son to one of Charlemagne's daughters, relations were quickly cut off. < ref name=Collins192/ >  Frankish ports were closed to British ships. < ref name=Collins192/ >  Offa, very involved in church affairs, presided over church councils personally in 786-7. < ref > John Cannon; Ralph Griffiths, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 22 < /ref >  In 787 he convinced the pope to create the position of archbishop of Lichfield in Mercia. < ref name=CannonGriffiths23 > John Cannon; Ralph Griffiths, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 23 < /ref >  He wanted his own archbishop who was closer at hand than the Archbishop of Canterbury. < ref name=CannonGriffiths23/ >  He reorganized the [[:en:wikt:defenses|defenses]] of his kingdom. One of these defenses, [[w:Offa's Dyke|Offa's Dyke]] was a massive [[:wikt:earthworks|earthworks]] between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms to the west. < ref name=Collins192/ >  Offa died in 796. < ref name=CannonGriffiths26/ >  His son, Ecgfrith, lasted only 141 days as king. Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's [[:wikt:reign|reign]]. < ref name=CannonGriffiths26/ > 
 
 == Viking invasions == 
 
 A new Mercian king, Raedwulf, was killed by [[Viking]] raiders in 844. < ref > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', Oxford University Press, 1971, pp. 243-44 < /ref >  In 855 Viking bands were recorded as being in Mercia near [[w:The Wrekin|Wrekin]]. < ref > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 243 < /ref >  But the year 865 saw a major change in activity by the Scandinavian invaders. < ref name=Kirby178 > D.

In 878 the Vikings in Mercia were attacked and defeated by King [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]]. < ref name=Collins381/ >  They converted to [[Christianity]] and settled on the land in East Anglia. < ref name=Collins381/ > 
 
 == Decline as a kingdom == 
 
 The ninth century saw the decline of Mercia as a kingdom. In 873-74 Mercia was conquered by the heathen army. < ref name=Kirby178/ >  In the 880s Wessex formed a marriage alliance with Mercia. < ref name=Yorke150 > Barbara Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'' (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 150 < /ref >  Alfred's daughter, Aethelflaed , married Aethelred (II), of Mercia. < ref name=Yorke150/ >  When Aethelred died, in 912, [[Edward the Elder]] appointed Aethelflaed (his sister) 'Lady of the Mercians.' < ref > ''The Eclectic Review'', Vol. 8 (London: Thomas Ward  &  Co., 1843), p. 553 < /ref >  When Aethelflaed died in 918, the Mercian [[:wikt:nobles|nobles]] now thought themselves free of Wessex rule. Edward stepped in and appointed Aethelflaed's daughter, Aelfwynn, to rule Mercia as his representative. < ref name=Stenton330 > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 330 < /ref >  But in 919 Edward brought her back to Wessex. < ref name=Stenton330/ >  After that Mercia was considered just another [[shire]] under his rule. < ref name=Stenton330/ >  A series of [[:en:wikt:ealdormen|ealdormen]] (similar to a [[count]] in [[Europe]]) followed. Under [[Canute]] in 1017, Mercia became one of the four divisions of England. < ref > Benjamin Thorpe, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' (London: Longman, Green, Longman  &  Roberts, 1861), p. 124, year 1017 < /ref >
