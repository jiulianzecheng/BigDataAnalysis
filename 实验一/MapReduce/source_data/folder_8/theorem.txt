 A '''theorem''' is a proven idea in [[mathematics]]. Theorems are proved using [[logic]] and other theorems that have already been proved. A minor theorem that one must prove to prove a major theorem is called a [[lemma]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-08-01|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/|access-date=2020-10-10|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Theorems are made of two parts: [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] and conclusions.  
 
 Theorems use [[deduction]], in contrast to [[theory|theories]] which are [[Empiricism|empirical]]. < ref > However, both theorems and theories are investigations. See {{harvnb|Heath|1897}} Introduction, The terminology of [[Archimedes]], p. clxxxii: " theorem (θεὼρνμα) from θεωρεἳν to investigate " < /ref > 
 
 Some theorems are trivial, since they directly follow from the propositions. Other theorems are called  " deep " , because their proof is long and difficult. Sometimes, such proofs involve other areas of mathematics or show connections between different areas. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Deep Theorem|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DeepTheorem.html|access-date=2020-10-10|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref >  A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]] (among other areas).  
 
 There are other theorems for which a proof is known, but cannot be easily written down. Among the best examples are the [[four color theorem]] and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search which is then verified by a computer program. At first, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted over the years. The mathematician [[Doron Zeilberger]] has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Doron Zeilberger's 51st Opinion|url=https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion51.html|access-date=2020-10-10|website=sites.math.rutgers.edu}} < /ref >  Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to simpler computations, including polynomial identities, [[Trigonometric Identities|trigonometric identities]] and hypergeometric identities. < ref > Petkovsek et al. 1996. < /ref >
