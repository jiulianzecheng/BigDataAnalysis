 A '''calculator''' is a machine which allows people to do [[mathematics|math]] operations more easily. For example, most calculators will [[addition|add]], [[subtraction|subtract]], [[multiplication|multiply]], and [[Division (mathematics)|divide]]. Some also do [[square root]]s, and more complex calculators can help with [[calculus]] and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A [[smartphone]] or other [[computer]] can also act as a calculator.  
 
 Some calculators, like the [[abacus]], will work without electricity. Others, like the electronic calculator, use batteries. Some calculators are simple, and can only [[addition|add]], [[subtraction|subtract]], [[multiplication|multiply]] and [[Division (mathematics)|divide]], and sometimes take [[square roots]]. Scientific calculators can do many other things, such as use [[exponents]] (or powers or indices) and [[trigonometry]] functions. 
 
 A printing calculator can print its results.

 A pocket calculator is a small calculator that helps people do [[arithmetic]]. It is so small that it can be put in a [[pocket]]. Its most common use is for [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].  Many pocket calculators are powered by [[solar cell]]s. They are commonly seen in schools and businesses and can be used quickly and efficiently for simple mathematical problems. Other names are 'miniature calculator' or 'mini calculator'. 
 
 == Scientific calculator == 
 A scientific calculator can do more things. It can often use [[exponents]] (or powers or indices), [[Pi (mathematical constant)|pi]], [[trigonometry|trigonometric ratios]], and the [[order of operations]]. Scientific calculators can also use bigger numbers. They tend to cost more than pocket calculators. Many are also [[computer program|programmable]]. The user can make a program directly with the calculator, or transfer one from a computer.
