 '''Fishsticks''' or '''fish fingers''' are a type of food probably invented in the [[United Kingdom]]. They are made of a [[whitefish]] like [[cod]] that is [[batter (cooking)|battered]] and [[breading|breaded]]. They are often eaten with [[tartar sauce]], [[cocktail sauce]], or [[ketchup]]. ''Fishsticks'' are popular with children and their parents as an easy-to-prepare finger food that is somewhat healthy for kids. 
 
 ==History== 
 Fishsticks first came about as a result of the invention of the [[plate froster]] in 1929, the first quick [[Refrigerator|freezer]]. To ensure rapid freezing, food needed to be in slim rectangular [[wikt:slab|slabs]]. A suitable candidate for this freezing method was fishsticks, slivers (small, thin pieces) cut from large fish and dipped in bread crumbs for frying. 
 
 In Britain in the 1950s, most of the [[herring]] catch was pickled and exported to other North [[Europe]]an countries. In an attempt to make herring more appealing on the home market, companies tried to present it in a new way, creating herring fishsticks called “herring savouries” and were tested on the market against a bland control product of [[cod]] sticks, sold as “fish fingers.” Shoppers in Southampton and South Wales, showed an overwhelming preference for the cod. Cod fishsticks were first produced in Great Yarmouth and introduced in Britain on 26 September 1955. They became immensely popular after [[Television commercial|television advertising]] began in 1956. To this day, fish sticks are a favorite food among children. 
 
 ==Production== 
 {{complex|date=April 2012}} 
 On modern production lines, headless [[fish]] are processed through a [[machine]] that removes a [[fillet]] from each side of the [[backbone]]. The fillets then pass over a [[wheel]] and a [[blade]] that separates the [[skin]] from the flesh. Machine filleting leaves a few pin-like [[bone]]s in the fillet, so the flesh containing the bones is cut out. 
 
 Fillets are formed into frozen blocks. A conveyor sends the blanks through [[batter (cooking)|batter]] and [[breadcrumb]]s, doubling the thickness of the fishstick. Then each is passed through a hot [[vegetable oil]] bath for about one minute to seal the coating and allow the fishstick to be grilled or fried. Then the fishstick is frozen again, with the center reaching -4 & nbsp;°F/-20 & nbsp;°C in less than 20 minutes. After packaging, it is stored at -18 & nbsp;°F/-28 & nbsp;°C, ready for distribution. 
 
 == Trivia == 
 
 * Fans of the [[New York Rangers]] of the [[NHL]] often taunt their rival team and fans, the [[New York Islanders]] because in the mid-1990s, the Islanders briefly changed their uniform from their traditional logo to a more new-age logo that featured a fisherman that many thought resembled the one on the box of Gorton's fish sticks. Rangers fans have been known to chant  " We want Fishsticks "  at both ''Madison Square Garden'' and the ''Nassau Coliseum'' during games between the teams.
