 A '''puffball''' is the common name for several groups of fungi in the division [[Basidiomycota]]. Puffballs include the [[genus|genera]] of  ''Calvatia'', ''Calbovista'' and ''Lycoperdon''. < ref > {{Cite web| last1 = Freedman| first1 = Louise| author-link =| last2 = Mycological Society of San Francisco| author2-link =| title = Wild About Mushrooms:Puffballs| origyear = 1987| year = 2000| url = http://www.mssf.org/cookbook/puffballs.html| accessdate = 2012-09-18}} < /ref >   
 
 All false puffballs are inedible, as they are tough and bitter to taste. The genus ''Scleroderma'', which has a young purple [[gleba]], should be avoided. < ref name= " MushroomsNA " > {{Cite book
