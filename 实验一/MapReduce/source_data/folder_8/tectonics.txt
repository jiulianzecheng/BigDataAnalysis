 '''Tectonics''' is the [[Research|study]] of the [[earth]]'s [[structure|structural]] features, especially the folding and [[faulting]] ([[Fracture (geology)|crack]]ing) of the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]]. 
 
 Tectonics (from [[Latin]], meaning  " building " ) is a field within [[geology]]. It includes structures in the [[lithosphere]] of the [[Earth]] and the forces and movements that have operated to create these structures. 
 
 Tectonics is concerned with [[orogeny|orogenies]] (mountain building) and major land features. This includes the [[earthquake]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] regions which affect certain parts of the world. This is discussed further in [[plate tectonics]]. < ref > Stanley, Steven M. 1999. ''Earth system history''. Freeman. p211–228 {{ISBN|0-7167-2882-6}} < /ref > 
 
 Tectonic studies are also important for understanding [[erosion]] patterns in geomorphology and as guides for the economic geologist searching for [[petroleum]] and [[metal]]lic [[ore]]s.
