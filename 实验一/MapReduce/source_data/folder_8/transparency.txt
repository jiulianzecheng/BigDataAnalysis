 In [[optics]], '''transparency''' is the [[property]] of allowing light to pass through something.   
 
 An [[wikt:object|object]] that is transparent can be seen through. The [[image]] you see through a transparent object is similar to the image you see without it.  However, the object may be changed if the transparent object behaves like a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] or like an [[optical filter]]; this could change the size, shape, or color of the image. The opposite of transparency is [[opacity]]. 
 
 Some [[Animal|animals]] are transparent, so [[predators]] cannot see them so easily. An example of a transparent animal is the [[jellyfish]]. Transparency works better in places with a small amount of [[light]] than in places with lots of light. 
 
 == Translucency == 
 If some [[light]] can be seen through an object but some of the detail of the image is lost, it is a '''translucent''' material.   
 
 Light passes through a translucent object, but you cannot see objects behind it. The light passes through but the material scatters the light, so you cannot see the object, only its [[shadow]]. 
 
 Examples of '''translucent''' materials are frosted [[glass]], thin [[paper]], and some types of [[amber]].
