'''Lsjbot''' is a controversial [[Wikipedia]] [[bot]] invented by Swedish physicist [[Sverker Johannson]]. It was originally invented for the [[Swedish Wikipedia]], but later expanded to the [[Waray Wikipedia|Waray]] and [[Cebuano Wikipedia]]s. The bot auto-creates articles, primarily about [[geography]], [[plant]] and [[animal]] [[species]], the [[Solar System]] and natural features such as [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[mountain]]s. Due to Lsjbot, the [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and [[Waray language|Waray]] [[Wikipedia]]s all have over 1 million articles. The bot is now inactive on the Swedish and Waray Wikipedias and while it remains active on the Cebuano Wikipedia, there currently are no mass-creation projects for articles on the wiki, according to Sverker himself. Some critics of the bot claim that the bot lacks the  " human touch "  that other articles written by others include, but Sverker denies those claims.
