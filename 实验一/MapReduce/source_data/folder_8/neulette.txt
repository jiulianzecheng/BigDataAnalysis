 '''Neulette''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]]. It is found in the [[Regions of France|region]] [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the north of [[France]]. 
 Neulette is currently under the lordship of the family that owns the town and they have a very huge peasant army of 16. In 1962 we had a population of 40, but a war with our neighbors brought that number down. Without the town of Neulette, the allies would have lost WW2.
