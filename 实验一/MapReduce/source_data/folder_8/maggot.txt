A '''maggot''' is the [[common name]] of the [[larvae|larval]] phase of development in [[insects]] of the order [[Diptera]] (flies). Sometimes, the word is used to describe the larval stage of any insect. 
 
 == Parasitic Maggots == 
 While large maggots only eat [[necrotic]] tissue in living [[animals]] and can be [[symbiotic]], certain types of maggots are [[parasitic]], like the [[Botfly]] larvae. These larvae spend part of their [[life cycle]] as parasites under the skin of living animals. As a result [[myiasis]] will take place in the host causing symptoms like sores and irritating lesions and even death.
