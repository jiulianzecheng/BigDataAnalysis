 A '''whiteboard''', also called a '''markerboard''', is a drawing surface on which markings made with [[marker]]s are visible. It is used as a surface to [[write]] on. Whiteboards are often used to help [[teach]].  Special markers are used that can be [[erase]]d. Whiteboards usually have a shiny surface. Before there were whiteboards, people used [[blackboard]]s so much. Chalks are used for  writing  on blackboards. Now, there is another improvement, people are now using electronic whiteboards, where it is controlled by a [[computer]] - this is sometimes called an interactive whiteboard (IWB). These were particularly popular in English schools in the 2000s.
