 During the period of the last ice age there were more species. They included a number of species of the elephant-like [[mammoth]]s and [[mastodon]]s. 
 
 The oldest proboscidean dates from the early [[Palaeogene]] period, over 50 million years ago. The evolution of the elephant-like animals mainly concerned the proportions of the cranium and [[jaw]] and the shape of the [[tusk]]s and [[molar]] teeth. These were [[adaptations]] to various kinds of vegetable. food
