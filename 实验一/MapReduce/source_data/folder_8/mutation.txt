 In [[biology]], a '''mutation''' is a change in the [[Genetics|genetic]] [[wikt:material|material]]. This means changes to the [[DNA]] or to the [[chromosome]]s which carry the DNA. These changes are [[heritable]] (can be passed on to the next generation) unless they have [[wikt:lethal|lethal]] effects. 
 
 Mutations can happen for several reasons. It can happen because of [[wikt:error|errors]] when ''[[meiosis]]'' produces the [[gametes]] ([[Ovum|eggs]]  &  [[sperm]]s). [[wikt:damage|Damage]] by [[radiation]], or by certain [[chemical]]s may cause mutations. Mutations occur at [[random]]. 
 
 Also, by derivation, an individual carrying the mutation may be called a '''mutant''' or a ''mutation''. So is the [[trait (biology)|trait]] (character) most obviously affected by the mutation. < ref name= " JMS " > Maynard Smith, John 1998. ''Evolutionary genetics'', 2nd ed. Oxford. p53–64 < /ref >

 === DNA mutations === 
 When DNA is copied mistakes are sometimes made – these are called mutations. There are four main types of mutations: 
 * ''Deletion'', where one or more DNA bases are left out. 
 * ''Insertion'', where one or more extra base is put in. 
 * ''Substitution'', where one or more bases are changed for another base in the sequence. 
 * ''Duplication'', where whole genes are copied. 
 
 === Chromosome mutations === 
 These terms are explained in the third diagram. 
 * ''Deletion'': a piece of chromosome is lost, together with any genes which may be on it. 
 * ''[[Gene duplication|Duplication]]'': part of a chromosome is repeated 
 * ''[[Chromosome inversion|Inversion]]'': part of a chromosome is reversed end to end 
 * ''Insertion'': a smaller chromosome is added into a longer chromosome 
 * ''Translocation'': part of a chromosome gets moved onto another chromosome 
 
 == Results of mutation == 
 Mutations may be bad for the organism, or neutral, or benefit the organism. Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism – the [[protein]] made by the 'new' DNA does not work at all, and causing the [[embryo]] to die. On the other hand, [[evolution]] is moved forward by mutations, when the new version of the protein works better for the organism. 
 
 Mutations are the ultimate source of [[Variation (biology)|variation]], upon which ''[[natural selection]]'' acts. What happens is that some mutations affect the organism's ability to live and reproduce. This is an important part of the [[wikt:theory|theory]] of [[evolution]]. The amount of heritable variation carried by a population can be huge, and as a result natural populations can change and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to conditions in their [[environment]]. < ref name= " JMS " / >
