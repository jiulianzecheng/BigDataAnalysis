 '''''Trypanosoma''''' is a [[genus]] of [[parasitic]] [[protozoa]]. There are in the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Kinetoplastida]]. They are a [[monophyletic]] group of unicellular [[parasite|parasitic]] [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]. < ref name= " Hamilton04 " > {{cite journal |author=Hamilton P.B. |display-authors = etal  |title=Trypanosomes are monophyletic: evidence from genes for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and small subunit ribosomal RNA |journal=Int.

 Most are transmitted by a [[Vector (biology)|vector]], usually by blood-feeding [[invertebrates]]. There are different mechanisms among the various species. In an invertebrate host they are generally found in the [[intestine]], but in their [[mammalian]] host they usually live in the [[bloodstream]] or inside cells. 
 
 Trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases, including the fatal human diseases [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], caused by ''Trypanosoma brucei'', and [[Chagas disease]], caused by ''Trypanosoma cruzi''. 
 
 The [[mitochondrial]] [[genome]] of the ''Trypanosoma'', < ref > known as the 'kinetoplast' < /ref >  and other [[kinetoplastid]]s, is made of a highly complex series of circles and minicircles. It needs many [[protein]]s for organisation during [[cell division]].
