 A '''cockfight''' is a [[blood]] sport between two or more [[rooster]]s that is held inside a cockpit. The combatants, called gamecocks, are specially bred birds. Cockfights are called blood sports by animal welfare and animal rights groups due to trauma inflicted between the roosters. The sport is illegal in the [[United States]] (and a felony in thirty States).
