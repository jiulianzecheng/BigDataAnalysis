 The '''constitution''' of a [[country]] (or a [[state]]) is a special type of [[law]] [[document]] that tells how its [[government]] is supposed to work. It tells how the country's [[leader]]s are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in [[office]], how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to [[vote]] and what other [[rights]] they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed. 
 
 Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution ''(see [[Rule of Law]] )''. On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions, or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others. This can be known as [[dictatorship]] or simply  " bending the rules " . A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a [[Federation]]. 
 
 The [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|UK's constitution]] is not written in one single [[wikt:document|document]] like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights Act 1689]] and including more modern [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]. Other parts of it are considered [[common law]] and are made up of the decisions of [[judge]]s over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or [[Judiciary|judicial]] [[Precedent|precedence]]. Because of this, some people say that the [[United Kingdom]] has a ''[[de facto]]'' or  " unwritten "  constitution. < ref > {{cite book|last=Barnett|first=H.|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|publisher=Cavendish|location=London|year=2005|edition=5|pages=9|quote=Conversely,  " A written constitution is one contained within a single document or a [finite] series of documents, with or without amendments " , ''id''.}} < /ref > 
   
 The [[United States]] in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions. The [[United States Constitution]] is also the shortest that people are still using, and it has been changed (amended) many times over the years. It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain. At first they had the [[Articles of Confederation]] but the Articles were replaced with today's Constitution. 
 
 [[Constitution of India|The Indian constitution]] of 1950 is the longest ever written constitution in the world. It originally consisted of 395 Articles arranged under 22 Parts and 8 Schedules. As of 2021, it has 470 Articles, 12 schedules, and 25 Parts with 5 appendices and 98 amendments.
