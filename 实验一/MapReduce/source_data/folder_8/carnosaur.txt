 '''Carnosaur'''s are a subgroup of the [[theropod]] [[dinosaurs]]. They are the [[clade]] '''[[Carnosaurus|Carnosauria]]'''. The term was once used very widely, but is now defined more narrowly. It is called by some authorities the '''Allosauroidea'''. < ref > Sereno P.C. 1999. The evolution of dinosaurs. ''Science'' '''284''' (5423): 2137–2147. < /ref > 
 
 The group includes some of the main [[carnivores]] of the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|periods]], such as ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]'' and ''[[Neovenator]]''. Modern [[cladistics|cladistic analysis]] defines Carnosauria (or Allosauroidea) as those [[tetanuran]]s which share a more recent [[common ancestor]] with ''Allosaurus'' than with modern birds. < ref > Sereno P.C. 1998. A rationale for phylogenetic definitions, with application to the higher-level taxonomy of Dinosauria. ''Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie Abhandlungen'' '''210''': 41–83 < /ref > 
 
 Carnosaurs are characterized by several features. Some features must have been [[adaptations]] to their large size, such as their open [[skull]], made of struts rather than solid bone. They had  
 large eyes and a long, narrow skull. The [[femur]] ( " thigh bone " ) is usually larger than the [[tibia]] ( " shin bone " ). This suggests close-to action was controlled by [[sight]].  
 
 The legs are adapted for running, but not extremely so. They had strong arms, probably used to wrestle prey as the teeth bit in. The structure of an ''Allosaurus'' suggests a strongly-built general all-round predator. This is a different from a [[tyrannosaur]] like ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', which was better adapted for running on open ground. Tyrannosaurs, with their small two-fingered hands, would use their heads for killing prey, and for head-butting rivals. 
 
 The idea that the group became extinct at the end of the Jurassic is refuted. < ref name=Benson/ >  It is now known that the Neovenatorid clade survived until the end of the [[Mesozoic]]. This group (see cladogram below) included  ''[[Aerosteon]]'', ''[[Australovenator]]'', ''[[Fukuiraptor]]'' and ''[[Neovenator]]''.
