 The '''Everglades''' is a flat [[tropical]] [[river]] and [[mangrove]] [[swamp]]. It is in the southern part of [[Florida]] near the city of [[Miami]]. The Everglades usually has tropical [[river delta]] which runs slowly through a low-lying [[Basin (geology)|basin]] near [[sea level]]. There are many [[plant]]s and many [[animal]]s that live here. It is the only place in the [[world]] where [[crocodile]]s and [[alligator]]s live together. It is a [[National Park]] and part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. < ref > UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/76  " Everglades National Park " ]; retrieved 2012-4-18. < /ref > 
 
 == National park == 
 Being a [[national park]] in the U.S. state of [[Florida]], it helps protect around 25 & nbsp;percent of the original Everglades. It is the largest [[Subtropics|subtropical]] forest in the United States. On average, around one & nbsp;million people visit it each year. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ever/parkmgmt/statistics.htm|title=Park Statistics|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2007-12-05}} < /ref > 
 
 It is the third-largest national park in the lower 48 & nbsp;states after [[Death Valley]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]. It is an [[International Biosphere Reserve]], a [[World Heritage Site]], and a [[Wetland]] of International Importance. It is one of only three parks in the world to be on all three lists. < ref > Maltby E.  &  P.J. Dugan 1994. Wetland ecosystem management and restoration: an international perspective in ''Everglades: the ecosystem and its restoration''. Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}} < /ref > 
 
 Unlike most national parks in the US, Everglades National Park was started to protect a weak [[ecosystem]] and its unique geographic feature. The Everglades are wetlands. It is created by a slow-moving river coming from [[Lake Okeechobee]]. It flows through the [[Kissimmee River]] to the  southwest at about {{convert|.25|mi|km}} per day, to [[Florida Bay]].  
 
 The park protects a connected network of [[Marsh|marshland]] and forest ecosystems. They are maintained by natural forces. < ref > Whitney, p. & nbsp;167 < /ref >  There are thirty-six species of [[Endangered species|endangered]] and [[threatened species|threatened]] living in the park. Some of them are: Florida [[Puma|panther]], the American [[crocodile]], and the West Indian [[manatee]].  
 
 The park protects the largest U.S. [[wilderness]] area east of the [[Mississippi River]]. < ref name= " main " > {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm|title=Everglades National Park|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2007-12-05}} < /ref >  It is the most significant [[Breed|breeding]] place for tropical [[wading bird]]s in North America. It also has the largest [[mangrove]] ecosystem in the [[Western hemisphere]]. < ref name= " main "  / >   
 
 It is also home to more than 350 & nbsp;species of birds, 300 & nbsp;species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40 & nbsp;species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles live within Everglades National Park. < ref > Robertson, p. & nbsp;27, 21, 38 < /ref > 
 ===Diversion and quality of water=== 
 All of South Florida's fresh water are kept in the [[Biscayne Aquifer]]. They are also [[Filter|recharged]] in the park. < ref name= " main "  / >  Only less than 50 & nbsp;percent of the Everglades water remain today.  
 
 Between the 1940s and 2000s, the number of [[Wader|wading birds]] has become smaller. It has reached around 90 & nbsp;percent decrease from their original numbers . < ref > Grunwald, p. & nbsp;202. < /ref >   
 
 The diversion of water to South Florida's still-growing metropolitan areas is the number one threat for the park's [[Population|inhabitants]].  
 
 In the 1950s and 1960s, {{convert|1400|mi|km}} of [[Canal|canals]] and [[Levee|levees]], 150 & nbsp;gates and spillways, and 16 & nbsp;pumping stations were built to lead water towards the cities and away from the Everglades. Low levels of water leave many fishes [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] to reptiles and birds. As sawgrass dry, it can burn or die off.  
 
 As a result, many [[Ampullariidae|apple snails]] and other animals that wading birds feed upon, are killed. < ref name= " brochure " > National Park Service (2005).  " Everglades. "  (Brochure) < /ref >  Populations of birds have been dropping.  
 
 In 2009, the South Florida Water Management District claimed that the number of wading birds across South Florida have increased by 335%. < ref > SFWMD (2010), p. 6-1. < /ref >  However, despite three years of reported higher numbers, ''The Miami Herald'' discovered the same year that populations of waders in the park decreased by 29%. < ref > Sessa, Whitney 2009. Taking a dive: the wading bird population at Everglades National Park dropped by 29 percent in 2008... " , ''The Miami Herald'', State and Regional News. < /ref >
