 '''''Tabernanthe iboga''''' or simply '''iboga''' is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[rainforest]] [[shrub]], native to western [[Central Africa]]. Iboga can be used as a drug; it stimulates the [[central nervous system]] when taken in small doses and induces [[Hallucination|hallucinations]] in larger doses.  In parts of Africa where the plant grows, the bark of the root is chewed for various pharmacological or ritualistic purposes.  [[Ibogaine]], the active [[alkaloid]], is also used to treat substance abuse disorders and depression. A small amount of ibogaine, along with precursors of ibogaine, are found in ''[[Voacanga africana]]''. 
 
 Normally, the plant grows to a height of about 2m. It may eventually grow into a small [[tree]] up to 10 & nbsp;m tall. It has small green [[leaf|leaves]]. Its [[flower]]s are white and pink, while the [[fruit]] can be either an elongated oval shape, or a round spherical shape. Fruits are orange in color. Its yellow-colored roots contain a number of [[indole]] [[alkaloid]]s, most notably [[ibogaine]], which is found in the highest concentration in the root-bark. The root material, bitter in taste, causes anesthetic sensation in the [[mouth]] as well as systemic numbness to the skin.
