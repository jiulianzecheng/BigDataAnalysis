 The '''ouroboros''' or '''oroboros''' is an ancient [[symbol]] of a [[snake |serpent]] or [[dragon]] [[self-cannibalism|eating its own tail]]. The ouroboros is a symbol of an everlasting [[cycle]] or a cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

Like the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], it symbolises cycles that begin again as soon as they end.  
 
 The first known appearance of the ouroboros motif is in [[KV62]], the [[tomb]] of [[Tutankhamun]], in the 14th century [[BC]]. The text is about the god [[Ra]] and his union with [[Osiris]] in the [[Duat|underworld]]. In an illustration, two serpents, with their tails in their mouths, coil around the head and feet of an enormous god (this the unified Ra-Osiris). The whole figure represents the beginning and the end of time. < ref > Hornung, Erik 1999. ''The Ancient Egyptian books of the afterlife''. Cornell University Press,  38; 77–78. < /ref >
