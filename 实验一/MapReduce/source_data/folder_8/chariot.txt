 A '''chariot''' is a type of [[transport]] used by many ancient [[civilisation]]s and [[people]]. A chariot is horse-drawn, meaning that is pulled along by [[horse]]s. A person who rides a chariot is called a '''charioteer'''.  
 
 Ancient Greek myths says that Poseidon, god of the sea, and Athena, goddess of wisdom, created the chariot together. Poseidon created the horses like waves, and Athena made the chariot. The two gods worked together.
