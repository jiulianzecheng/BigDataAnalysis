 '''Kaltjiti''' (also previously known as '''Fregon''') is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] community in the [[Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara|Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands]] in [[South Australia]]. It is located about {{convert|45|km}} south of the [[Musgrave Ranges]] and is {{convert|137|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Stuart Highway]]. The town sits on [[Officer Creek]], which flows from [[Mount Woodroffe]]. The creek is usually a dry sandy bed and only flows at times of very high rainfall. There are about 350 people living at Kaltjiti. < ref > {{cite web|title=Fregon|publisher=PY Media|work=Waru|url=http://www.waru.org/communities/fregon/|accessdate=28 October 2012|archive-date=27 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927022138/http://www.waru.org/communities/fregon/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The first recording by white Australians of a community at Kaltjiti was by explorer [[Ernest Giles]]. He wrote that he found 200 male Aborigines there in September 1873, during his second trip into the South Australian desert. The meeting was violent, as Giles and his travellers interrupted a sacred [[ceremony]]. The first European settlement near Kaltjiti was set up in 1934. It was established by a dogger ([[dingo]] [[hunter]]), who was given the rights to the nearby [[Groundwater|bore]] (called Shirley Well) by the government as a reward for all the dingos he had killed. < ref > {{cite web|title=Conference Paper - Tom Gara|publisher=History Trust of South Australia|url=http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/conference/Tom_Gara.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042543/http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/conference/Tom_Gara.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2007}} < /ref >  By the late 1950s, Aboriginal families were camped at Shirley Well permanently. In 1960, the [[Station (agriculture)|station]] at [[Ernabella]] was expanded to include Shirley Well. 
 
 A [[Outstation movement|outstation]], called Fregon, was built with government help by 1961, as a base for Aboriginal [[Stockman|stockmen]] and their families. It was built {{convert|4|to|5|km|abbr=on}} south of Shirley Well on Officer Creek. The aim of the settlement was to provide training in working with [[livestock]] and for the families to have access to [[Homeland|traditional country]] in the sandhills to the west. Fregon was administered through [[Pukatja, South Australia | Ernabella]] and it was not until 1968 that it had its own [[airstrip]]. It began with a school, a small health clinic, a workshop, a small store and houses for the staff. 
 
 Mail is delivered to Kaltjiti twice a week. Supplies are delivered every two weeks. Water is provided from four bores and placed in storage tanks for pumping to the community. Electricity comes from a [[Diesel engine|diesel]] [[generator]]. Kaltjiti does not have a permanent police presence. State police are based at [[Marla]] and run patrols to the area.
