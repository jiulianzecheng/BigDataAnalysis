 A '''hedgehog''', also called a '''hedgepig''' or '''furze-pig''', is a small [[mammal]]. < ref name=msw3 > {{MSW3 Erinaceomorpha | id = 13600003 | pages = 212–217}} < /ref >  It has between 5000 and 7000 [[spine]]s on its [[back]]. There are hedgehogs in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[New Zealand]]. When attacked or threatened, it curls up. Hedgehogs eat [[insect]]s, [[snail]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[snake]]s, [[bird]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], [[carrion]], [[mushroom]]s, [[berry|berries]] and [[melon]]s. Sometimes, hedgehogs will search for [[earthworm]]s after [[rainstorm]]s. 
 
 Hedgehogs are [[nocturnal]] animals and they hibernate between November and March. 
 
 == Description == 
 Hedgehogs have long spines, or quills, made of [[keratin]]. They do not come off easily, unlike [[porcupine]]s, but in baby hedgehogs, the baby quills drop off and are replaced with adult quills. This is called  " quilling " . When they are very [[wikt:stress|stressed]] or sick, their quills can fall off, too. Their quills are not [[poison]]ous: they are safe for humans to feel and touch, as they are not very sharp, or harmful. 
 
 == Pets == 
 Some people keep hedgehogs as pets. African pygmy hedgehogs are the most common type that are kept as pets. They live 2–4 years in captivity. Hedgehogs are exotic pets, which means they may not be legal to keep as pets in some places.
