 In [[Norse mythology]], '''Valhalla''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Valhöll'' - “hall of the slain”) is an enormous and majestic hall in [[Asgard]], headed by [[Odin]]. Described as a  " warrior's paradise, "  it is here that the souls of those who are slain in battle go, chosen and guided by the [[Valkyries]], a group of warrior maidens in service to Odin. Once they are there, these [[einherjar|eïnherjar]], as they are known, make revelry, as they feast on the beast known as Sæhrímnir, having their fill of mead made from the udders of the female goat [[Heiðrún]]. The feast is prepared by [[Andhrímnir]] ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “the one exposed to soot”), the cook of the gods, in his cauldron, [[Eldhrímnir]] ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “fire-sooty”). Outside of Valhalla’s doors lies '''Glasir''' ([[Old Norse]]: “gleaming”), a massive tree that grows golden leaves, while its ceiling is adorned with golden shields. The tree '''Læraðr''' stands atop the great hall, where both Heiðrún and the stag [[Eikþyrnir]] ([[Old Norse]]: “oak-thorny”) graze its foliage. During [[Ragnarök]], the eïnherjar will aid Odin in his battle against Surtr and his forces.
