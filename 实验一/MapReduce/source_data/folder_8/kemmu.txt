 ==Events of the Kemmu era == 
 In 1333-1336, the [[Kemmu Restoration]] was an attempt by Emperor Go-Daigo to restore Imperial authority after the fall of the [[Kamakura shogunate]]. The failure of this effort led to the creation of two rival Imperial courts. < ref name= " Nussbaum 2002 507 " / > 
 * '''1334''' (''Kemmu 1''): Emperor Go-Daigo caused ''Kemmu nenchū gyōji'' to be written. This was a book which described the ceremonies of the court; and its purpose was to aid the process of reviving ancient court etiquette. < ref name= " Nussbaum 2002 507 " / > 
 * '''25 October 1334''' (''Kemmu 1, 27th day of the 9th month''): Emperor Go-Daigo made an Imperial progress to [[Kamo-jinja]]. No other emperor would visit Kamo's shrines until April 29, 1863 (''[[Bunkyu]] 3, 11th day of the 3rd month''), when [[Emperor Komei]] made an Imperial progress to Kamo. < ref name= " pf325 " > [[Richard Ponsonby-Fane|Ponsonby-Fane, Richard]]. (1956). ''Kyoto: The Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869,'' p. 325. < /ref > 
 * '''1336''' (''Kemmu 3''): An anonymous author published ''Kemmu nenkan ki,'' which was a chronicle of the Kemmu era. The text is a source of information about laws, government, bureaucrats, and arable lands and estates given by the emperor to the nobility or to religious institutions (''[[shōen]]''). < ref name= " Nussbaum 2002 507 " / > 
 * '''1336''' (''Kemmu 3''): Ashikaga Takauji issued a new legal code with 17 articles (''Kemmu-shikimoku''). < ref > {{cite book| last = Nussbaum | first = Louis-Frédéric| title = Japan Encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA178| year = 2002| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-01753-5| page = 507 }} < /ref >

 ==Southern Court ''nengō''== 
 The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Shōkei'' 1 as time was reckoned in the Northern Court in Kyoto; and the era began in ''Genkō'' 4, as time was ordered in the Southern Court in Yoshino.
