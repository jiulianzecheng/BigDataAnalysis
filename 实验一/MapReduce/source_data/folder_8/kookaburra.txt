 '''Kookaburras''' are [[bird]]s of the [[genus]] '''''Dacelo''''' and are native to [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]]. An adult kookaburra is generally 28–42 [[centimetre]]s from the head to the tip of the tail. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 
 * Genus ''Dacelo'' 
 ** [[Laughing Kookaburra]] (''Dacelo novaeguineae'') – Native to eastern mainland Australia, introduced to [[Tasmania]], [[Flinders Island]], [[Kangaroo Island]] and [[Western Australia]]. Some were also introduced to [[New Zealand]] between [[1866]] and [[1880]]; but only those that were freed by Sir [[George Grey]] on [[Kawau Island]] are still there today. 
 ** [[Blue-winged Kookaburra]] (''Dacelo leachii'') – Native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea. 
 ** [[Spangled Kookaburra]] (''Dacelo tyro'') – Found only on the [[Aru Islands]] and [[Trans Fly savanna and grasslands]] of southern New Guinea. 
 ** [[Rufous-bellied Kookaburra]] (''Dacelo gaudichaud'') – Widely distributed through forests of lowland New Guinea and has also been seen on [[Saibai Island]] in Queensland. 
 
 == Life == 
 Kookaburras usually eat small animals: small [[mammal]]s (like [[mouse|mice]]), [[insect]]s, small birds, [[lizard]]s and [[snake]]s.  
 
 Kookaburras usually live in family groups. Young kookaburras help their parents to hunt and care for the smaller children. 
 
 Kookaburras are well known for their loud call, which sounds a bit like human [[laughter]]. Kookaburras use their calling to show others what is their land.
