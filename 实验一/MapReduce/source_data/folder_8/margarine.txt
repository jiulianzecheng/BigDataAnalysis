 '''Margarine''' is an [[wikt:artificial|artificial]] [[butter]]. It can be made from [[vegetable oil]], or [[animal fat]]. It may also contain [[skimmed milk]], [[table salt|salt]] and emulsifiers. Margarine is used in many [[Baking|baked]] products. It contains less [[fat]] than butter, so is often chosen instead of it. There are also  " low fat "  margarines, which contain even less fat. However, many types of margarine are made with [[Hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] oils. Products with hydrogenated oil have [[trans fat]]s, which are unhealthy and can cause [[heart disease]]. Other fats, like [[olive oil]], and [[butter]], are a better choice for cooking.
