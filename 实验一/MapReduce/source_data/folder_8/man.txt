 A '''man''' is an [[adult]] [[male]] [[human]]. He is the opposite of a [[woman]]. People use the word  " man "  (one ''man'', two or more ''men'') to talk about [[gender]]. Manhood is the period in a male's life after he changes from a [[boy]]. A boy is a male [[child]]; a female child is called a [[girl]]. After boys reach [[Age of majority|maturity]], they can be called a man. 
 
 Like most other male mammals, a man inherits an [[X chromosome]] from his mother and a [[Y chromosome]] from his father. The [[men's rights movement]] is a group that tries to fight for men's rights and opposes [[misandry]]. 
 
 Someone who [[transgender|changes gender]] to male would also be called a man.

 There are some sexual differences between a man and a woman. Men have [[sex organ]]s which we call  " external "  (not inside the body). But many parts of the male reproductive system are internal too. The study of male reproduction and sex organs is  " [[andrology]] " .

 Men normally have the same illnesses as women, but there are some sexual illnesses which men have only, or more often. 
 
 There are more differences between men and women, not only sexual differences. 
 * Some people say men, as a group, are more [[aggression|aggressive]] than women; they want to fight more. But most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive. 
 * In modern western society, few men wear make-up or [[clothing]] of the sort women traditionally wear. 
 
 Some examples of [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary sexual characteristics]] in male humans: 
 * more [[pubic hair]] 
 * more [[facial hair]] 
 * more body hair 
 * larger hands and feet than women 
 * broader [[shoulder]]s and chest 
 * narrower [[hips]] 
 * larger [[skull]] and [[bone]] structure 
 * larger [[brain]] 
 * greater [[muscle]] mass 
 * a more visible [[Adam's apple]] and deeper [[voice]] 
 * a longer [[Tibia|shinbone]] 
 
 Men are usually taller than women. In 1996, the average height of men around the world was 171 cm. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Human Height |journal=Our World in Data |date=8 October 2013 |url=https://ourworldindata.org/human-height|last1=Roser |first1=Max |last2=Appel |first2=Cameron |last3=Ritchie |first3=Hannah }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Biology]] is not the only thing which makes people feel they are men, or that other people are men. Some people were born in a female body but feel that they are men. We call these ''[[transgender]]'' or ''[[transsexual]]'' men. Some men can have a hormone or chromosomal difference (for example  " androgen insensitivity syndrome " ). Some men have other [[intersex]] conditions. Some of those intersex people who people said were female (girls) when they were born want to change this later in their lives.
