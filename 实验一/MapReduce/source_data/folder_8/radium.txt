 '''Radium''' is a [[chemical element]]. The [[Chemical symbol|symbol]] for radium is '''Ra''', and its [[atomic number]] is 88. It was discovered by [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in the form of radium chloride in 1898. It is a slivery-white [[alkaline earth metal]], but it turns black quickly when it is exposed to [[nitrogen]] in the [[air]]. All [[isotope]]s of radium are [[Ionizing radiation|radioactive]]. The radioactivity of radium causes it to [[Radioluminescence|glow in the dark]]. 
 
 Radium is used in many things, such as glowing watches, which are now banned because they can cause [[radiation poisoning]]. Some of the things radium was used for are now made using less dangerous radioactive elements, such as [[promethium]]. It can be used in treating cancer. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Radium 223 (Xofigo) {{!}} Cancer treatment {{!}} Cancer Research UK|url=https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/radiotherapy/internal/radioactive-liquid-treatment/radium-223|access-date=2021-06-08|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org}} < /ref > 
 
 In nature, radium is found in tiny amounts in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] [[Ore|ores]]. It does not exist naturally inside of people or other living things; it is dangerous when [[Exposure (toxicology)|taken in]] because it takes the same place as [[Calcium|calcium.]] 
 
 == History == 
 Radium was discovered by [[Marie Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie]] on 21 December 1898. < ref > {{Cite book|title=CRC handbook of chemistry and physics: a ready-reference book of chemical and physical data|date=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-5511-9|editor-last=Haynes|editor-first=William M.|edition=92nd ed., 2011 - 2012|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|editor-last2=Lide|editor-first2=David R.}} < /ref >  They found that some radioactive [[Mineral|minerals]] had unknown compounds left over after removing uranium and [[barium]]. The unknown compounds were [[polonium]] and radium; the discovery was announced to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] on 26 December 1898. 
 
 The original [[unit of measurement]] for radioactivity was called the [[Curie (unit)|curie]]. The unit was equal to the radioactivity of one [[gram]] of radium-226, < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Lehnert|first=A.L.|last2=Kearfott|first2=K.J.|date=1996|title=A flag-based algorithm and associated neutron interrogation system for the detection of explosives in sea–land cargo containers|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2015.02.026|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|volume=112|pages=13–21|doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2015.02.026|issn=0969-806X}} < /ref >  but later it was changed to 3.7×10 < sup > 10 < /sup >  disintegrations per second. 
 
 == Properties == 
 Radium is the heaviest [[alkaline earth metal]] and the only radioactive element in the group. It has a silvery-white color, but turns black when it is exposed to air. It is more similar to [[barium]] than it is to any other element. It is also similar to barium in the ways it reacts with other things.  
 
 Radium has 33 [[Isotope|isotopes]]. All of these isotopes are radioactive. The isotope which lasts the longest is radium-226: it has a [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of 1,600 years. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Radium used to be used in glowing paints for watches and other instruments that are used in the dark. Radium stopped being used in the mid-1920s after a lawsuit by five people who were called  " [[Radium girls|Radium Girls]] " . The Radium Girls were told to lick the brushes used to paint with radium, which caused them to ingest radium. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Frame|first=Paul|date=1999|title=Radioluminescent paint|url=https://www.orau.gov/health-physics-museum/collection/radioluminescent/index.html|access-date=2023-12-18|website=Museum of Radiation and Radioactivity|language=en}} < /ref >  This was very dangerous to their health. Ingesting radium in paint caused sores, [[anemia]], and [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]] in the Radium Girls. The lawsuit caused the dangers of radioactivity to be known by many more people. After the 1960s, radium paint was replaced by less dangerous radioactive paint made from [[promethium]]-147 or [[tritium]]. 
 
 Radium was also used in different things such as toothpaste and food. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Les  " pouvoirs miraculeux "  de la radioactivité|url=http://www.dissident-media.org/infonucleaire/radieux.html|access-date=2023-12-18|website=www.dissident-media.org}} < /ref >  These products were made illegal after people found out about the dangers of radioactivity. 
 
 Radium is not used now in anything except for [[Nuclear reactor|nuclear reactors]]. < ref > {{Citation|last=Keller|first=Cornelius|title=Radionuclides, 2. Radioactive Elements and Artificial Radionuclides|date=2011-10-15|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14356007.o22_o15|work=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|editor-last=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH  &  Co.

 == Toxicity == 
 Radium is the most [[Poison|toxic]] radioactive element. It collects in bones when ingested, which causes cancer.  However, even just being around radium can cause cancer. Radium creates [[radon]] when it [[radioactive decay|decays]]. This is even more dangerous, because radon is a [[gas]]. 
 
 Marie Curie's death was most likely caused by radium. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Radioactive: Marie  &  Pierre Curie ; a tale of love  &  fallout|url=https://archive.org/details/radioactivemarie0000redn|date=2011|publisher=It Books|isbn=978-0-06-135132-7|editor-last=Redniss|editor-first=Lauren|location=New York}} < /ref >
