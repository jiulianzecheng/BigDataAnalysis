 Pringles are known for their packaging, which is made up of a [[cardboard]] tube with a plastic lid on top. It is also known for the logo, which has a drawing of a man with a large [[Moustache|mustache]]. The shape of the chips themselves are a special shape called a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], so if you look at it from the side it can look like it curves up, but looking at it from another side makes it curve down.
