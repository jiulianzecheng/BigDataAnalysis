{{Infobox nihonium}} 
 '''Nihonium''' (ニホニウム) is a [[chemical element]]. It is also named '''eka-thallium'''. It has the symbol '''Nh'''. It has the [[atomic number]] 113. It is a [[transuranium element]]. The name  " nihonium "  comes from the name of [[Japan]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], 日本 (''nihon''). 
 
 Nihonium does not exist in nature, and can only be made [[artificial]]ly. It is made from the [[radioactive decay#Alpha decay|alpha decay]] of [[moscovium]]. 
 
 There are no known uses for nihonium. What nihonium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight. Based on trends in the [[Periodic Table]] it could be soft, silver color, very [[chemical reactivity|reactive]] metal like [[sodium]]. 
 
 == History == 
 On February 1, 2004, Nihonium and [[moscovium]] were [[Discovery (observation)|discovered]]. A team of [[Russia]]n [[scientist]]s at [[Dubna]] from the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] and [[United States|American]] scientists at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] first [[report]]ed the chemical elements. 
 
 On September 28, 2004, a team of [[Japan]]ese scientists said that they had made the element. < ref > Morita ''et al.'', [http://jpsj.ipap.jp/link?JPSJ/73/2593/ ''Experiment on the Synthesis of Element 113 in the Reaction  < sup > 209 < /sup > Bi( < sup > 70 < /sup > Zn, n) < sup > 278 < /sup > 113''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705203116/http://jpsj.ipap.jp/link?JPSJ%2F73%2F2593%2F |date=2007-07-05 }}, [http://www.ipap.jp/jpsj/index.htm J.

 In May 2006, in the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] made nihonium using a different method. They found the [[identity]] of the last products of the radioactive decay of the nihonium they made. 
 
 == Name == 
 Ununtrium was a temporary [[IUPAC]] [[systematic element name]] meaning  " one-one-three "  in Latin.  < !-- 
 Scientists from [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] proposed the name  " Becquerelium "  (Bq) in honour of french physicist [[Henri Becquerel]]. -- no source with no mention or confirmation outside this article, from en:Nihonium -- > 
 Scientists from Japan suggested the name ''japonium'' (symbol ''Jp'') or ''rikenium'' (''Rk''). < ref > [http://www.riken.go.jp/engn/r-world/info/release/news/2004/nov/index.html Discovering element 113] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812052643/http://www.riken.go.jp/engn/r-world/info/release/news/2004/nov/index.html |date=2011-08-12 }} Riken News. Accessed 23 November 2006. < /ref >  However, they picked Nihonium because not only is it discovered in Japan, but it means Japan, too, as Nihon is Japan or Japanese in Japanese.
