 An '''acrolith''' is a type of [[sculpture]] or carved art. In an acrolith, the outermost parts, for example the head, hands and feet, are made of stone, and the rest is made in a different material. < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite encyclopedia|editor=Chisholm, Hugh|year= 1911|title= Acroliths |work=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|volume= 1 |edition=11|publisher= Cambridge University Press|pages=155}} < /ref >  The different material is usually wood or something else that can wear out or rot, so it does not survive. Museums and other collectors often have only the stone parts. They are often separated from each other. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek traveller and geographer who lived during the 2nd century A.D., talked about acroliths. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
