 '''Racing''' is a kind of [[competition]] or [[contest]] where winning means doing or [[wikt:finish|finishing]] something before the other contestants do.   
 
 Usually, a race [[wikt:involve|involves]] [[people]] getting from one place to another. [[Running]] is a kind of racing where people try to be the first person to run from the where the race started to the goal or finish line. People also race in [[car]]s, [[boat]]s, [[airplane]]s and other [[vehicle]]s, and on [[animal]]s like [[horse]]s. Animals and machines can also race without people riding them. Often they race on a [[race track]]. 
 
 A race can also involve any other type of goal like [[eating]].  An example is a [[hot dog]] eating race, where people try to eat more hot dogs than the other contestants.   
 
 Some contests are not races. They could involve contestants trying to get the highest score in a particular quiz.
