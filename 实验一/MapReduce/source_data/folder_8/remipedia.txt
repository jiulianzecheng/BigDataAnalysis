 '''Remipedia''' is a [[Class (biology)|class]] of blind [[crustacean]]s. They live in coastal [[aquifer]]s. 
 
 So long as the water is [[saline|salty]], these little animals can be found. 
 They are found in almost every [[ocean]] basin, including in [[Australia]], the [[Caribbean Sea]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. They live in [[subtropical]] waters. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Stefan Koenemann | display-authors = etal|year=2007 |title=Phylogenetic analysis of Remipedia (Crustacea) |journal=Organisms, Diversity  &  Evolution |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=33–51 |doi=10.1016/j.ode.2006.07.001}} < /ref > 
 
 The first described remipede was a [[fossil]] called ''Tesnusocaris goldichi'' (early [[Pennsylvanian]]). Since 1979 at least 17 living species have been identified. 
 
 Genetic studies suggest that remipedes are the [[arthropods]] most closely related to [[insect]]s. < ref > [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100216114034.htm Where did insects come from? New study establishes relationships among all arthropods] < /ref > 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 Remipedes are {{convert|10|-|40|mm|in|1}} long. They have a head and a long trunk of up to forty-two similar body [[Segmentation|segments]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://cameronmccormick.blogspot.com/2008/11/remipedia.html |title=Remipedia  |work=The Lord Geekington |author=Cameron McCormick |date= 2008}} < /ref >  The swimming [[appendage]]s are on the sides of each segment, and the animals swim on their backs. They are generally slow-moving. 
 
 They have fangs connected to secretory [[gland]]s. It is not known whether these glands secrete digestive juices or poisonous [[Venom (poison)|venom]]. They have a primitive body plan in crustacean terms, and may be a basal, ancestral crustacean group. 
 
 At least one species, ''Godzilliognomus frondosus'', has an organised brain, with a particularly large [[olfactory]] area. Species which live in dark environments need to detect [[scent]]s in the water. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Martin Fanenbruck, Steffen Harzsch  &  Johann Wolfgang Wägele |year=2004 |title=The brain of the Remipedia (Crustacea) and an alternative hypothesis on their phylogenetic relationships |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.0306212101 |volume=101 |issue=11 |pages=3868–3873|pmid=15004272 |pmc=374336 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  The size and complexity of the brain suggested that Remipedia might be the sister taxon to [[Malacostraca]], regarded as the most advanced crustaceans.
