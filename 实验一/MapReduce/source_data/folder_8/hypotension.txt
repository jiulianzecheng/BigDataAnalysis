'''Hypotension''' is low [[blood pressure]].  A person with low blood pressure is called '''hypotensive'''. 
 
 Everybody's blood pressure is different.  Some people have naturally low blood pressure.  However, for most adults, a [[Systole#Systolic pressure|systolic blood pressure]] of under 90, or a [[Diastole#Diastolic pressure|diastolic blood pressure]] of under 60, is low blood pressure. < ref name=mayo > {{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-blood-pressure/basics/treatment/con-20032298 |title=Low blood pressure (hypotension). |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2014-05-02 |website=Mayo Clinic Online |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2015-11-28 |quote=}} < /ref >   (Systolic is the top number in a blood pressure reading; diastolic is the bottom number.) 
 
 ==Symptoms== 
 Low blood pressure is not always dangerous.  However, low blood pressure is dangerous if it causes any of these [[symptom]]s: < ref name=mayo/ > < ref name=aha > {{cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/AboutHighBloodPressure/Low-Blood-Pressure_UCM_301785_Article.jsp#.VlmgMEv7VSU |title=Low blood pressure. |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2015-10-22 |website=American Heart Association Online |publisher=American Heart Association |accessdate=2015-11-28 |quote=}} < /ref >

 * Feeling dizzy 
 * Fainting (this is called [[syncope]]) 
 * If the blood pressure gets even lower, or the person faints, when they stand up (this is called orthostasis or orthostatic hypotension).  This means that the blood pressure is so low that it cannot get [[blood]] to the [[brain]] when the person is standing up. 
 * Pale, cold, clammy skin (this is called diaphoresis).  This is a sign that the body is in trouble, and is using its natural defense strategies to try to fix a problem. 
 * Being [[Altered state of consciousness|unable to think]] or focus on something 
 * [[Nausea]] 
 * Feeling tired or [[Depression (mental illness)|depressed]] 
 * Feeling very [[thirst]]y (this happens when low blood pressure is caused by [[dehydration]], meaning the person has not drunk enough fluids.  The body senses this and gets thirsty so the person will drink more) 
 * Quick, shallow breathing (this is a sign that the body is not getting enough blood and [[oxygen]], and is trying to take in more oxygen by breathing faster)

 == What problems can low blood pressure cause? == 
 If low blood pressure makes a person faint, the person could hurt themselves while falling. < ref name=aha/ > 
 
 If a person's blood pressure is very low, the heart will be unable to pump blood and oxygen to important parts of the body.  Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to live.  [[Ischaemia|Without blood and oxygen]], important parts of the body, like the heart and brain, can be damaged. < ref name=mayo/ > 
 
 == Treatment == 
 
 === First aid === 
 If a person's blood pressure is low enough that they are feeling dizzy, they should lay down on the ground.  Putting their feet up, or bending their knees, is also helpful.  This makes it easier for blood and oxygen to get to the brain (because the blood does not have to work against [[gravity]] to get up to the brain, like it would if the person were standing).  Lying down will also make sure that the person does not hurt themselves by falling if they faint. < ref name=nhs > {{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Blood-pressure-(low)/Pages/Treatment.aspx |title=Low blood pressure (hypotension) - Treatment. |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2015-05-22 |website=NHS Choices |publisher=National Health Service (UK). |accessdate=2015-11-28 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 === Medical treatment === 
 Doctors can treat hypotension by treating whatever is causing the low blood pressure.  Sometimes, low blood pressure is caused by dehydration.  This can be treated by having the patient eat more salt, drink more fluids, or (in serious cases) [[Intravenous therapy|get fluids through a needle placed into a vein]]. < ref name=aha/ > 
 
 If low blood pressure is caused by [[Medication|medicines]], doctors can change those medications to others that do not lower blood pressure as much. < ref name=nhs/ > 
 
 There are also medications that increase blood pressure.  They work by making it harder for [[blood vessel]]s to relax.  (When [[Vasodilation|blood vessels relax]], blood pressure goes down.  If the blood vessels cannot relax as easily, blood pressure goes up.) < ref name=nhs/ >
