 A '''gynoecium''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''gyne'',  " woman " ) is the [[female]] reproductive parts of a [[flower]]. The male parts are called the [[androecium]]. Some flowers have both female and male parts, and some do not. 
 
 Another key term is '''carpel'''. Carpels are the building blocks of a '''pistil'''. The gynoecium may have one pistil or more. A pistil may have one carpel or more than one stuck together ( " fused " ). Carpels and pistils have three parts: a [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] at the top where the pollen lands; a '''style''' and an '''ovary'''. In the case of a pistil, the stigma, style, and ovary may be made up of those parts of more than one carpel, fused. 
 
 Plant ovaries are the parts of the gynoecium which (much like animal ovaries) contain [[ovule]]s. The style is generally stalklike. It is between the ovary at the bottom and the stigma at the top. In some plants, there are no styles in the pistils. The stigma is the pollen receptor at the top of the carpel. Stigmas may be separate or they may be in a region called the  " stigmatic region " . < ref name= " multiple " > Simpson M.G. 2006. ''Plant systematics''.

 == Carpel anatomy == 
 A '''carpel''' is the basic unit of the [[female]] reproductive organ of a [[flower]] (the gynoecium).  The parts of the carpel are: 
 *the '''stigma''': the end portion which receives the [[pollen]]. It is usually sticky; 
 *the '''style''', a stalk connecting the stigma with the ovary. It has a tract, which helps the growth of the pollen tube so the male [[gamete]] gets to the [[ovule]]; and 
 *the '''ovary''' has the female reproductive cell or ovule. 
 
 == The ovule == 
 {{main|Ovule}} 
 
 The '''ovule''', when mature, has one or two coats round the central '''nucellus''', except at the top where there is an opening, the '''micropyle'''. The [[nucellus]]  is a tissue round one large cell, the megaspore. The one large cell divides, giving the egg and some other cells. 
 
 An example of a simple carpel is that of a [[pea]], [[bean]] or ''[[Arabidopsis]]'': the fruit develops from the single carpel consisting of two rows of ovules aligned beside one another along the ''placental'' margin. 
 
 == Pistil ==
