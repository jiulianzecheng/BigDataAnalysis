 The '''Denisovans''' or '''Denisova hominins''' are  archaic humans in the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]''. They are either an [[extinction|extinct]] [[species]] or [[subspecies]].  
 
 They were first discovered in {{Nowrap|March 2010}} in the Denisova Cave in the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Siberia]]. This cave that has also been lived in by [[Neanderthal|Neanderthals]] and [[Homo sapiens|modern humans]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/08/scientists-map-an-extinct-denisovan-girls-genome/|title=Scientists map an extinct Denisovan girl's genome|author=David Leveille|date= 2012|publisher=PRI|work=The World|accessdate=31 August 2012}} < /ref > < ref name= " washingtonpost " > {{Citation|last=Brown|first=David|title=DNA from bone shows new human forerunner, and raises array of questions|date= 2010|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/24/AR2010032401926_pf.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}} < /ref > < ref name=Krause > {{Citation|last=Krause|first=Johannes|display-authors=etal|title=The complete mitochondrial DNA genome of an unknown hominin from southern Siberia|year=2010|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=464|issue=7290|pages=894–97|bibcode=2010Natur.464..894K|doi=10.1038/nature08976|pmid=20336068|pmc=10152974 |s2cid=4415601 }} < /ref >   
 
 A finger bone fragment of a juvenile female was discovered. She lived about 41,000 years ago,  with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of [[Melanesia]]ns and [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal Australian]]s and around 6% in Papuans deriving from Denisovans. < ref > " {{cite journal|last1=Callaway|first1=Ewen|year=2011|title=First Aboriginal genome sequenced|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/news.2011.551}} < /ref > < ref > " About 3% to 5% of the DNA of people from Melanesia (islands in the south-west Pacific Ocean), Australia, [[New Guinea]] and aboriginal people from the Philippines comes from the Denisovans " .

 The [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) of the finger bone showed it was genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. The nuclear [[genome]] from this specimen suggested that Denisovans shared a common origin with Neanderthals. < ref name= " nytimes " > {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/science/23ancestor.html?hp|title=Denisovans Were Neanderthals' Cousins, DNA Analysis Reveals|author=[[Carl Zimmer]]|date=22 December 2010|newspaper=NYTimes.com|accessdate=22 December 2010}}. < /ref >   
 
 DNA analysis has indicated that modern humans, [[Neanderthal|Neanderthals]], and the Denisova hominin last shared a common ancestor around {{Nowrap|1 million}} years ago. < ref name=Alla > Katsnelson, Alla  2010. New hominin found via mtDNA. ''The Scientist'' (24.03.10) < /ref > 
 
 The mtDNA analysis also suggested that this species was the result of a migration [[out of Africa]] that came between a migration by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' individuals and later ones by some ancestors of most modern humans. < ref name=Alla/ > 
 
 == Fossils == 
 So far, the fossils of four distinct Denisovans from Denisova Cave have been identified through their DNA: '''Denisova 2''', '''Denisova 3''', '''Denisova 4''', and '''Denisova 8'''. Denisova 2 and Denisova 3 are young females,and Denisova 4 and Denisova 8 are adult males.  < ref >  Slon, Viviane ''et al'' 2017. A fourth Denisovan individual. ''Science Advances'' '''3''' (7): e1700186. doi:10.1126/sciadv.1700186. PMC 5501502. PMID 28695206. < /ref > 
 
 === Anatomy === 
 So far, only a finger bone, a toe bone and two teeth are the only body parts that have been found.  The finger bone is from a woman.  It is broader than a human finger.  This fact suggests that Denisovans were more robust than any modern humans. 
 
 === Mitochondrial DNA analysis === 
 The mtDNA from the finger bone differs from that of modern humans by 385 [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]] in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500. This  is more than the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals, which is around 202 bases. < ref name=Krause/ >
