 The '''Puli''' is a small to [[wikt:medium|medium]] sized [[dog breed]]. It was brought to [[Hungary]] with the [[Magyars]] in the late [[9th century]]. They are used as [[herd]]ing and [[guard dog]]s. 
 
 Female Pulis are about {{convert|16.5|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} high. Males are {{convert|17|in|abbr=off|sp=us}}. < ref name= " Puli Breed Standard " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/puli/index.cfm |title=Puli Breed Standard |access-date=2014-08-21 |archive-date=2014-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810141507/http://www.akc.org/breeds/puli/index.cfm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   Females weigh {{convert|23|to|25|lb|abbr=off|sp=us}}. Males weigh a little more. 
 
 == Behavior == 
 The Puli is an [[intelligent]] and active dog. It needs [[obedience training]] while still young. < ref name=Gerstenfeld178 > Sheldon L. Gerstenfeld, ''ASPCA Complete Guide to Dogs'' (San Francisco, CA: Chronicle Books, 1999), p. 178 < /ref >  If a Puli gets enough [[exercise]] it can live in the city, even in an [[apartment]]. < ref name=Gerstenfeld178/ >   
 But Pulis do best when not kept as indoor [[pet]]s in a small living space. < ref > [http://www.haziallat.hu/kutya/kutyafajtak/puli-magyar-pasztorkutya/1891/ Hungarian dog breeds]. Dr. Sárkány Pál - Dr.Ócsag Imre. {{ISBN|963-232-261-4}}. {{in lang|hu}} < /ref >  Pulis kept indoors need a lot of exercise to use up their [[energy]], or they can became either shy or overactive. They need to get the kind of exercise they were created for. < ref > [http://www.akutya.hu/pasztorkutyak/puli History and How to keep a Puli] {{in lang|hu}} < /ref >   A Puli without enough exercise can became mischievous and cause trouble. < ref > [http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/pulis.html Is Puli the right dog for you?] < /ref >  The right kind of exercise includes running, biking, hiking, jogging and field work;  not just a walk around the corner. Pulis are best kept in a house with a [[garden]]. < ref > [http://www.citydogs.hu/fajtak/puli Citydogs {{in lang|hu}}] < /ref > 
 
 The Puli is happiest when it has work to do. Then this dog will show excellent intelligence, strength and ability to work with [[human]]s. This satisfies their strong [[instinct]] to guard their herd. < ref > Liz Palika, ''The Howell Book of Dogs: The Definitive Reference to 300 Breeds and Varieties'' (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley Publishing, 2007), p. 16 < /ref > 
   
 As a working dog, the Puli is obedient and focused when doing a [[task]]. Some of them are used as [[police dog]]s. They are one of the best [[sheepdog]]s. Pulis don't need to be taught how to guard the sheep. They naturally protect their territory and flock. Even though they are not big dogs, they will still try to scare away anyone they do not know. 
 
 If well trained, they understand even the smallest instructions and obey. They are excellent in [[obedience trial]]s for dogs. These are also dogs who are sensitive (get their feelings hurt easily). Pulis hate being bullied or made fun of. Because they are so intelligent, they understand that they are being mistreated. If not treated well, they lose their desire to [[cooperation|cooperate]]. 
 
 Pulis are not very friendly with people they do not know. With owners and friends, these dogs are funny, lovely and playful. Pulis bark quite a lot. 
 
 ==Fur== 
 The coat of [[fur]] on a Puli is [[rope|corded]], like [[dreadlocks]]. The puli is a one-colored dog. It is usually black. It can also be white, gray, or cream. All Pulis, even the white ones have black eyes,  black noses and black feet.  The Puli's coat needs a lot of care to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. About 45 minutes of grooming work each week is recommended. < ref > {{cite book |author=Yamazaki, T.; Kojima, T. |year=1995 |title=Legacy of the Dog: The Ultimate Illustrated Guide to over 200 Breeds |url=https://archive.org/details/legacyofdogu00yama |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0811810690}} < /ref >  When the dog is older the cords can become quite long and heavy. They sometimes are so long that they touch the ground. The cords can be thinner or thicker cords. < ref name= " Breed standard " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/puli/index.cfm |title=Breed standard |access-date=2014-08-21 |archive-date=2014-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810141507/http://www.akc.org/breeds/puli/index.cfm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The thin, nice cords are made by keeping the fur clean and cared for. Thin ropes are made by hand forming thinner ropes. < ref name= " Breed standard " / >
