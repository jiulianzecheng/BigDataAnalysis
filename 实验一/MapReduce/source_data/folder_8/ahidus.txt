 == Origins and characteristics == 
 The origins of Ahidus are unknown because of the lack of research studies. Ahidus is believed to be originated from the Berber tribe of Zenata. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://decouvrirlalgerie.wordpress.com/2016/08/12/hidous-ou-lexpression-musicale-berbere-de-louest/|title=Hidous ou l'expression musicale berbère de l'Ouest|last=ArudjBarberousse|date=2016-08-11|website=Algérie Découverte|access-date=2017-05-22}} < /ref > 
 The starting formation of the dance was done by making a closed circle which represented the unity between the performers and the inhabitants of the tribe. The lead dancer would stand in the middle and guide the group. 
 
 An important aspect of Ahidus is the traditional dance. Men wears white djellaba and turban representing the symbol of peace. As for women, they were free to wear either white or colourful kaftans coupled with silver jewellery. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.maghrebvoices.com/a/amazigh-morocco-/435428.html|title=أحيدوس.. من الأطلس المتوسط إلى العالمية|website=www.maghrebvoices.com|language=ar|access-date=2020-03-01}} < /ref >
