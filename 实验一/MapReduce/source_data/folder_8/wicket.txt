 In [[cricket]], a '''wicket''' is: 
 
 * An object made up of three sticks (called stumps) stuck into the [[ground|earth]], with two small sticks (called bails) balanced on them. They are like a target for the fielding team, and can be hit with the ball to try to get batsmen [[Out (cricket)|out]]. 
 * A batter getting out, meaning they can't bat anymore. A team that has  " lost 5 wickets "  has had 5 of its batters get out.  
 * The [[cricket pitch]] itself.  
 
 == Object == 
 There is one wicket in each of the two [[batsmen's grounds]]. The fielding team can hit a wicket with the ball to [[run out]] a batsman, but only if there is no batsman in the ground of the wicket. < ref > {{Cite web|title={% DocumentName %} Law {{!}} MCC|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/run-out|access-date=2020-10-31|website=www.lords.org}} < /ref >  In addition, when delivering the ball to the batsman, the bowler can hit the wicket in the striker's ground with the ball to [[Bowled|bowl]] the striker out. < ref > {{Cite web|title={% DocumentName %} Law {{!}} MCC|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/bowled|access-date=2020-10-31|website=www.lords.org}} < /ref > 
 
 The wicket is said to have been  " put down "  when any of its 5 sticks fall to the ground because it was hit by the ball or a player holding the ball. < ref > {{Cite web|title={% DocumentName %} Law {{!}} MCC|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/the-wicket-is-down|access-date=2020-11-17|website=www.lords.org}} < /ref >  The sticks can be put back in place and then hit back off to put the wicket down more than once. 
 
 === Sides of the field === 
 The field can be defined as having two halves: the  " off side "  and the  " leg side " / " on side " , with these being separated by an imaginary line connecting the middle stump of both wickets. The off side of the field is the right side of a field for a right-handed batsman who is looking at the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]], and the leg side is the left side. (This is reversed for a left-handed batsman.) < ref > https://www.lords.org/getattachment/MCC/All-Laws/2nd-Edition-of-the-2017-code-2019.pdf The diagram on P.80 < /ref >
