 A '''Bazooka''' is a very powerful weapon that shoots a [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rocket]]. It is a small and easily carried and sits on the shoulder to fire. It can also fire armour piercing missiles. The word ''Bazooka '' comes from a musical instrument made of pipes invented by an American radio comedian, Bob Burns (1896â€”1956). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bazooka|title=Bazooka|work=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|access-date=2009-09-18}} < /ref > < ref name=olive/ > 
 
 The bazooka was invented by rocket scientist, [[Robert H. Goddard]], at the end of [[World War I]]. In [[World War II]] the weapon was quickly developed for use by the army. In June 1942 it went from being a basic drawing design to use on the battlefield in only 30 days. < ref name= " olive " > {{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_infweapons_bazooka.php|title=Bazooka|date=22 May 2008|work=Olive-Drab|access-date=2009-09-18}} < /ref >  Improved versions in later years are called [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s.
