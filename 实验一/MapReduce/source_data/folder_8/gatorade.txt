 '''Gatorade''' is a brand of sports-themed food and beverage products, built around its signature product: a line of [[sports drinks]]. Gatorade is currently manufactured by [[PepsiCo]], distributed in over 80 countries. < ref name=factsheetGatorade > {{cite web|title=Gatorade Fact Sheet|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Download/Gatorade_Company_Fact_Sheet.pdf|publisher=PepsiCo, Inc.|accessdate=24 January 2011|year=2010}} < /ref >  The beverage was first developed in 1965 by researchers at the [[University of Florida]], to replenish the combination of water, [[carbohydrates]], and [[electrolytes]] that the school's student-athletes lost (in sweat) during rigorous athletic competitions. Its name was derived from the collective nickname of the university's athletic teams,  " the [[Florida Gators|Gators]] " . 
 
 Originally produced and marketed by [[Stokely-Van Camp]], the Gatorade brand was purchased by the [[Quaker Oats Company]] in 1983, who was bought out by PepsiCo in 2001. As of 2010, Gatorade is PepsiCo’s 4th-largest [[Trademark|brand]], on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales. < ref name=annrpt2010 > {{cite web|title=2010 Annual Report|url=http://pepsico.com/annual10/downloads/PepsiCo_Annual_Report_2010_Full_Annual_Report.pdf|work=PepsiCo, Inc.|accessdate=27 July 2011|page=16|archive-date=6 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906155910/http://www.pepsico.com/annual10/downloads/PepsiCo_Annual_Report_2010_Full_Annual_Report.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It primarily competes with [[Coca-Cola|Coca-Cola's]] [[Powerade]] and [[Vitaminwater]] brands worldwide; plus, [[Lucozade|Lucozade Sport]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

 == In popular culture == 
 Gatorade has been the subject of substantial media attention and reference in popular culture situations, most of which are in relation to team or individual athletic sports. The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the Gatorade shower, originally called the  " Gatorade Dunk, "  where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler, sneak up behind the head coach, and pour the contents of the cooler (generally Gatorade and ice) over his head at the end of an [[American football]] game. This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when Harry Carson and Jim Burt, of the [[New York Giants]], doused head coach Bill Parcells during the 1985 season. Burt's teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team's championship season of 1986-87. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports. 
 
 Gatorade has also achieved status as the cliché representative for sports drinks in American media, for example, in the film Clerks, the character Dante is at one point forced to give free Gatorade to his hockey teammates, and in the film ''[[The Waterboy]]'', [[Adam Sandler]] is told that  " the water sucks "  and that Gatorade is superior.
