 A '''lighter''' is a [[tool]] that can produce a flame, on demand. It is made of a plastic or metal container, which contains a flammable liquid or gas. There is also a means of producing the flame, and extinguishing it, when it is no longer needed. 
 
 One of the first lighters was developed by the [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]] [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]] in 1823. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.gnegel.de/feudoebereiner.htm |title=Döbereinersche Feuerzeuge |first= |last= |work=gnegel.de |year=2004 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |archive-date=4 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804092917/http://www.gnegel.de/feudoebereiner.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.planet-wissen.de/natur_technik/feuer_und_braende/feuer/geschichte_des_feuerzeugs.jsp |title=Planet Wissen - Feuerzeug |first= |last= |work=planet-wissen.de |year=2011 |accessdate=16 December 2011}} < /ref >  The lighter was produced until around 1880. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ijon.de/sonst/feuerg.html#doeber |title=Feuererzeugende Geräte |first= |last= |work=ijon.de |year=2004 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |archive-date=23 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191123224957/http://www.ijon.de/sonst/feuerg.html#doeber |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.pfeife-tabak.de/Artikel/Verschiedenes/Feuer/feuer.html |title=feuer |first= |last= |work=pfeife-tabak.de |year=2008 |accessdate=16 December 2011}} < /ref >  The lighter was named [[Döbereiner's lamp]]. 
 
 There is often an electric cigarette lighter in cars. When the lighter button is pushed in, a metal [[heating element]] is connected to the car's 12 volt [[electricity]] supply, and it heats up to a high temperature. The lighter is then removed from the socket and the element is used to light the tip of a [[cigarette]]. The socket that the lighter goes in can also be used to power [[mobile phone]]s and other electronics, and the term  " cigarette lighter "  is now commonly used to refer to this type of connector even when not being used to light a cigarette.
