 The '''brolga''' (''Grus rubicunda'') is a bird in the family [[Gruidae]]. It lives in [[Australia]]. < ref name= " NSW " > {{cite web|publisher=[[New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage]]|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10382|accessdate=September 3, 2021|title=Brolga - profile|date=April 2, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 Only two [[crane (bird)|cranes]] live in Australia, the brolga and the [[sarus crane]]. < ref name=NSW / > 
 
 ==Appearance== 
 
 This is the largest bird in Australia that can fly. (The [[emu]] is larger but does not fly.) It is 1.3 & nbsp;metres tall and its wings stretch 2.5 & nbsp;metres from end to end.  Its feathers are light gray except under the chin, and there is some red skin on its neck.  it has long black legs. < ref name=NSW / > 
 
 Young brolgas are darker gray with no red or black. < ref name=NSW / > 
 
 ==Habitat and food== 
 
 The brolga looks for food in swamps and other [[wetland]]s.  It will put its head all the way under the water.  It can look for food in drier places, like grasslands and farms, but it goes to wetlands when it can. < ref name=NSW / > 
 
 The brolga digs into the ground with its strong bill.  It pries up bits of earth.  It eats the roots of [[sedge]] plants the most, but it also eats molluscs, frogs, [[crustacean]]s, and large insects. < ref name=NSW / > 
 
 ==Breeding == 
 
 Brolga [[mating dance|dance for each other]].  It jumps in the air, stretches down and up, throws things into the air, and makes loud noises. < ref name=NSW / > 
 
 Brolga make nests.  They build a [[platform]] out of mud, grass, and sticks.  They build it on an island or even in the water.  They have two [[clutch (eggs)|eggs at a time]]. < ref name=NSW / > 
 
 ==Threats== 
 
 The brolga suffers from [[habitat loss]] because humans drain their swamps to make farmland and control [[flooding|flood]]s.  Long ago, farmers poisoned brolga so they would not eat [[crop]]s. < ref name=NSW / >
