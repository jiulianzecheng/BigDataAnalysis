'''Behavior''' (or '''behaviour''') is what an [[animal]] does and how they act. Behaviors may be [[conscious]] or [[unconscious]]. They may be [[Heredity|inherited]] or [[Learning|learned]]. The term is also used for [[systems]] and for [[machines]] which interact with their environment. The term is not well-defined. < ref > Levitis, Daniel; William Z. Lidicker, Jr; Glenn Freund (2009). Behavioral biologists do not agree on what constitutes behavior. ''Animal Behavior''. '''78''' (1): 103â€“10. doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.03.018. PMC 2760923. PMID 20160973 < /ref > 
 
 In [[experiment]]s, behavior is the observed [[reaction]] which occurs when an [[organism]] is given a [[stimulus]]. Some organisms are more complicated than others and may be more [[:wikt:awareness|aware]] of their surroundings. If their behavior is [[consciousness|conscious]] it means that they know what they are doing. If they are not aware of what they are doing this is unconscious behavior. 
 
 [[Human]]s will pull their hand back without [[:wikt:thought|thinking]] if they accidentally touch something [[heat|hot]]. This is done because we (and other animals) inherit [[nervous system]] [[reflex]]es which cause us to pull away from the thing that is causing the [[pain]]. 
 
 Behavior is linked to the [[nervous system]] as well as the [[endocrine system]]. The nervous system reacts, and notices what happens. The [[hormone system]] is much slower. It makes some kinds of behavior more, or less, likely. A simple example is the change from being a child to an adult. This involves a whole range of [[hormone]]s which affect [[growth]] and behavior. 
 
 Behavior is also linked to [[learning]]. Organisms which are more complicated can learn better than those that are simpler. However, even the simplest animals show [[habituation]], which is a primitive kind of learning. For organisms, learning means that they change their behavior because they remember having been in that situation before and know how to react. 
 
 People often use the word  " behavior "  to mean the way people interact with (behave towards) one another. [[Child]]ren are taught what is good behavior and what is bad behavior. Good behavior is about being [[:wikt:polite|polite]] and thoughtful to other people. It is the kind of behavior that people in a society expect from others.
