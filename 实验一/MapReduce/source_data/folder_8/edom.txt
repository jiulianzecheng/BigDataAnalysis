The nation's name in [[Assyrian language|Assyrian]] was '''Udumi'''. In [[Syriac language|Syriac]] it was '''{{lang|syr|ܐܕܘܡ}}'''. In [[Greek language|Greek]], it was '''{{lang|grc|Ἰδουμαία}}''' (Idoumaía). In [[Latin]], it was '''{{lang|la|Idumæa}}''' or '''{{lang|la|Idumea}}'''. 
 
 The Edomite people were a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking tribal people. They lived in the [[Negev Desert]] and the [[Arabah]] valley. The Arabah valley is now the south of [[Dead Sea]] and next to the [[Jordan]]. The area has much red [[sandstone]]. This may have made the name  " Edom " .  The nation of Edom is known to have existed back to the [[8th century BC|8th]] or [[9th century BC]]. The Bible dates it back several centuries further.

Others argue that the 8th or 9th century dates are right. < ref > van der Steen, Eveline; Piotra Bienkowski ''How Old is the Kingdom of Edom'' [http://www.wadiarabahproject.man.ac.uk/titlepage/news/Antiquity/WAP%20review.htm]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >   The nation stopped being a settled state after the [[Jewish-Roman Wars]].
