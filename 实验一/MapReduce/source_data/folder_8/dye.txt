'''Dye''' is a [[substance]] used to [[color]] materials. It is often used to color the [[fabric]] used to make [[clothing]]. It has low [[solubility]]. A [[pigment]] won't do this because it won't stick to the [[fiber]]s of the fabric and color them. A dye can be natural, usually made from plant material such as berries, or a dye can be artificial, meaning that it is made by humans from chemicals such as [[petrochemical]]s. 
 
 Most natural dyes are gotten from different parts of a [[plant]] like the [[Root|roots]], [[Fruit|fruits]], [[bark]], [[Leaf|leaves]], [[wood]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[Lichen|lichens]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/667210526|title=Harvesting color : how to find plants and make natural dyes|last=Burgess, Rebecca, 1977-|date=2011|publisher=Artisan|others=Green, Paige|isbn=978-1-57965-425-2|location=New York|oclc=667210526}} < /ref >  Most dyes are synthetic and are made from petrochemicals. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_F4hAwAAQBAJ & dq=organic+dye+laser & pg=PA539|title=Laser Fundamentals|last=Silfvast|first=William T.|date=2008-07-21|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-85557-0|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Classification== 
 Dyes can be classified based on their [[solubility]] and chemical properties.  
 
 * [[Acid dye]]s can dissolve in water.  They are used on [[fiber]]s such as [[silk]], [[wool]], [[nylon]].  Most [[food coloring]] that are made by man are acid dyes.  Examples of acid dye are Alizarine Pure Blue B, [[Acid red 88]], etc. 
 * Basic dyes can dissolve in water.  They are mainly used on [[acrylic]] fibers.  They may also be used on wool and silk.  Basic dyes are also used to make [[paper]] colourful.
