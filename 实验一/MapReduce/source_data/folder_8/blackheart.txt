'''Blackheart''' is a fictional demonic entity from [[Marvel Comics]] and the son of Mephisto, as such he is a creature of immense supernatural power and pure evil that is comparable to an arch-demon in status: although not quite as powerful as his father, Blackheart is more than a match for any of Earth's heroes and has faced many of Marvel's greatest heroes in battle. He serves as one of [[Ghost Rider]]'s main enemies. 
 
 The character is played by actor [[Wes Bentley]] in the 2007 supernatural movie, [[Ghost Rider (movie)|''Ghost Rider'']].
