 '''Dreieich''' is a city in the [[Offenbach Rural District]] in the state of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 
 Dreieich is in the ''Rhine Main area''. Its northern urban district Sprendlingen is {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Frankfurt]]. In the south it touches the City of [[Darmstadt]]. The whole area of the town is {{convert|53.33|km2|abbr=off}}. It is {{convert|140|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. < ref > [http://www.dreieich.de/ Homepage of the City of Dreieich], looked up on 17 January 2010, German. < /ref >  It is a plain area with no hills. 
 
 About 35 to 20 million years ago in the Age of [[Tertiary]] the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of [[sediment]]s sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor. 
 
 The city consists out of the towns Dreieichenhain and Sprendlingen and the 3 former independent villages Buchschlag, Götzenhain and Offenthal, all now urban districts of Dreieich. On 1 January 1977 they were united and became the City of Dreieich. 
 
 The name Dreieich means ''three oaks''. This is a hint to the former landscape. In the [[Middle Ages]] the Dreieich area was a huge forest with a lot of wild animals, where only the emperor had the right of hunting. 
 
 The neighbours of Dreieich are:  
 * [[Neu-Isenburg]] (North) 
 * [[Rödermark]], [[Dietzenbach]] and [[Heusenstamm]] (East) 
 * [[Messel]] ([[Darmstadt-Dieburg Rural District]]) and [[Darmstadt]] (South) 
 * [[Langen]] (West) 
 
 Dreieich has 40,432 inhabitants (2008). < ref > [http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html Official statistiks of the state of Hesse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173109/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html |date=2016-05-13 }}, looked up on 17 January 2010, German. < /ref > 
 
 The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany. 
 
 Some local people are speaking a regional type ([[dialect]]) of the German [[language]] with a certain tone and special words. It is a [[Hessian dialects|Hessian dialect]] (German: ''Hessisch''). This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a [[minority]] and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain [[pronunciation]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 In the 9th century the names of Sprendlingen and Offenthal were written down in documents for the first time. But people think, that especially Sprendlingen is much older because of its name. They say the name was given by the [[Alamanni]], a band of west germanic tribes (see also: [[germanic peoples]]), which had settled in the area a long time before. 
 
 Formerly the people in the Dreieich area were mostly [[farmer]]s and [[craft]]smen but not [[trade]]smen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the [[industrial revolution]] the Rhine Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for [[metal]] working and [[leather]] [[manufacturing]], also chemical processing. Many men got [[work]]men and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.
