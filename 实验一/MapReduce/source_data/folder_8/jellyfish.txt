 '''Jellyfish''' are animals of the phylum [[Cnidaria]]. They are a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]], the '''Medusozoa'''. < ref > Daly M. ''et al'' 2007. The phylum Cnidaria: a review of phylogenetic patterns and diversity 300 years after Linnaeus. ''Zootaxa'', '''1668''': 127–182, Wellington.   [http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01668p182.pdf Abstract - PDF] < /ref >  Most of them live in the oceans, in salt water, where they eat small sea animals like plankton and little fish, and [[wikt:float|float]] in the sea. Only a few jellyfish live in fresh water.  
 
 They have soft bodies and long, [[Sting (biology)|stinging]], [[poison|venom]]ous [[tentacle]]s that they use to catch their prey, usually small plankton animals or small crustaceans or tiny fish. Some jellyfish hunt others by stinging cells called ''nematocysts''. A jellyfish is 97% water. < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/invertebrates/jellyfish/Jellyfishcoloring.shtml |title=Jellyfish, Enchanted Learning Software |work=enchantedlearning.com |accessdate=7 April 2010}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |title=Israeli boy, 9, dies in Thailand after jellyfish sting |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-boy-9-dies-in-thailand-after-jellyfish-sting/ |website=The Times of Israel |accessdate=31 August 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 Most jellyfish have a [[bell]]-shaped [[body]] and long [[tentacle]]s at the underside of the body. Tentacles are long  " arms "  with special stinging [[cell]]s called cnidoblasts containing the structure of the nematocyst. The nematocysts are pockets in the tentacle that have a small stinger that is sealed with a cap. There is a microscopic hair, or “trigger” on the outside of the pockets and when the tentacle brushes against something it activates the hair which opens the cap and allows salt water to pour in. The inrushing salt water increases the pressure in the nematocyst pushing out the venomous tentacle or thread, thus stinging the jellyfish’s prey. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Olivia|date=2019-03-27|title=All about jellyfish stings|url=https://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/all-about-jellyfish-stings|access-date=2022-03-14|website=Curious|language=en}} < /ref >  They move by contracting their bodies, but they do not have much control over where they go: most of the time, they drift with the water current. The largest type of jellyfish is the Lion's mane jellyfish, which has tentacles that can be as long as 60 meters, but most jellyfish are much smaller. 
 
 The Medusozoa are four [[Class (biology)|classes]] of the Cnidaria:  < ref > Classes in Medusozoa based on {{cite web| url=http://www.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=11582| title=The Taxonomicon - Taxon: Subphylum Medusozoa| accessdate=2009-01-26| publisher=Universal Taxonomic Services| archive-date=2009-03-11| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311093127/http://www.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=11582| url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 There are many types of jellyfish. The smallest jellyfish are just a few centimetres across. The largest jellyfish is the Lion's mane (''Cyanea capillata''), whose body can be over 3 feet (1 m) across, with much longer tentacles. Some jellyfish [[wikt:glow|glow]] in the dark (this is called [[phosphorescence]]). Some of the most dangerous jelly fish include the [[box jelly]] (Genuses ''Chironex'', ''Chiropsalmus'' and ''Carybdea'') and the tiny, two-cm-across [[Irukandji jelly]] (''Carukia barnesi''); the venomous sting of these jellyfish can kill a person. 
 
 Many animals eat jellyfish, including sea turtles and some fish (including the sun fish). Humans eat jellyfish too; especially in Asia jellyfish are a delicacy. Jellyfish spoil very quickly after they are caught. Sometimes they are dried to preserve them. Or, they are cleaned, which can take up to 40 days. They are often eaten in a kind of salad, with soy sauce or vinegar. 
 
 == Life cycle == 
 [[File:Polypen einer Gorgonie.jpg|thumb|Polyps]] 
 Most jellyfish undergo two distinct life history stages (body forms) during their [[life cycle]]. The first is the [[polyp]]oid stage, when the animal takes the form of a small stalk with feeding tentacles. Very often, this polyp is attached to the sea floor, or to another hard surface; it rarely moves around. A polyp that lives that way is called [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]]. In some cases, the polyp is free-floating. Polyps generally have a mouth surrounded by upward-facing tentacles. Polyps may be on their own or in groups, and some bud [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]], making more polyps. Most are very small, measured in [[millimeter]]s. 
 
 In the second stage, the tiny polyps asexually produce jellyfish, each of which is known as a [[Medusa (animal)|medusa]]. Tiny jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed in the [[plankton]]. Jellyfish reproduce both sexually and asexually. Well-fed adult jellyfish [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] daily. In most species, spawning is controlled by light, so the entire population spawns at about the same time of day, often at either dusk or dawn. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Claudia|year=1983|title=Vertical migration and diel activity patterns of hydromedusae: studies in a large tank|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|volume=5|pages=619–635|doi=10.1093/plankt/5.5.619|issue=5}} < /ref >  Jellyfish are usually either male or female (with occasional [[hermaphrodites]]). In most cases, adults release [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and eggs into the surrounding water, where the (unprotected) eggs are fertilized and mature into new organisms. 
 
 Medusae have a [[Symmetry in biology|radially symmetric]], umbrella-shaped body called a bell, which is usually supplied with marginal tentacles that capture prey. A few species of jellyfish do not have the polyp portion of the life cycle, but go from jellyfish to the next generation of jellyfish through direct development of fertilized eggs. Jellyfish at the medusa stage usually lives only up to six months, after which it dies. 
 
 Jellyfish eat [[plankton]] and small fish, which they catch using their [[poison|venom]]ous tentacles. Jellyfish may live in [[symbiosis]] with [[algae]]. The jellyfish transports them into sunlight and get [[nutrients]] from the algae's [[photosynthesis]]. Both forms of jelly fish have small tentacles with nematocysts (stinging cells) that sting and can hurt people on contact. 
 
 === Other facts === 
 Medusozoans differ from anthozoans in having a [[Jellyfish#Life history and behavior|medusa]] stage in their life cycle. Their [[mitochondrial DNA]] molecules are linear rather than circular as in anthozoans and almost all other animals. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Kayal, Ehsan |display-authors = etal |year=2012 |title=Evolution of linear mitochondrial genomes in medusozoan cnidarians |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evr123 |pmid = 22113796 |pmc = 3267393 }} < /ref >  The [[cnida]]e, the explosive cells of the Cnidaria, are of a single type. There are [[Cnidocyte|nematocysts]] but no spirocysts or ptychocysts. < ref name=Ruppert > {{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=148 }} < /ref > 
 
 A group of jellyfish is called a current; an occurrence of many jellyfish simultaneously is sometimes called a ''bloom''.
