The '''Triassic''' is the first [[Period (geology)|geological period]] in the [[Mesozoic era]] and the seventh period of the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]]. It lasted 50.6 [[million]] years. The period began 251.9 million years ago, and ended 201.3 million years ago. < ref name=chart > {{cite web |url= http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf |title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart |author=Cohen, K.M.; Finney, S.;  &  Gibbard, P.L.|date=January 2013 |website=International Commission on Stratigraphy |publisher=International Union of Geological Sciences |accessdate=June 12, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale|title=ICS - Chart/Time Scale|website=www.stratigraphy.org}} < /ref >  Its start and finish were both notable extinction events. < ref > Sahney S.  &  Benton M.J. 2008.

 The period before the Triassic was the [[Permian]] period, the last period in the [[Palaeozoic]] era. The [[Jurassic]] period came after the Triassic. < ref name=chart/ > 
 
 Many new groups arose during the Triassic period, including the first [[dinosaur]]s, the first [[mammal]]s, the first [[Pterosaur|pterodactyls]], the first [[Ichthyosaur|ichthyosaurs]] and the first [[Plesiosaur|plesiosaurs]]. < ref name=brit/ > 
 
 ==Extinction events== 
 {{See also|Extinction event}} 
 
 Great [[extinction event]]s happened at the beginning and end of the Triassic period. The Triassic began after the great [[extinction]] at the end of the [[Palaeozoic]] era, the [[Permian/Triassic extinction event]].  
 
 Nobody really knows the exact cause of the Permian/Triassic extinction, and experts have different [[theories]]. < ref > Erwin D.H. 1993.

 The Triassic had several more extinction events, whose causes are also unknown. The most significant of these took place at the end of the Triassic, which was one of the 'big five' [[Phanerozoic]] [[Ocean|marine]] [[extinction]]s. < ref > Raup D.M. and Sepkoski J.J. 1982.

 == Geology == 
 === Name === 
 The name 'Triassic' comes from the three [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[strata]] that formed during the Triassic period ( " tri "  means  " three " ). < ref name=brit > {{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/science/Triassic-Period |title=Triassic Period |author=Logan A. |date=2016 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc |accessdate=June 12, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >  Three layers of rock strata formed during this period: < ref name=brit/ > 
 *[[Red bed]]s, laid down in [[desert]] conditions; 
 *[[Limestone]], laid down in [[seas]], mostly over [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]]; and 
 *Black [[slate]], laid down in rich organic conditions such as [[river delta]]s. 
 
 === Overall climate === 
 On average, the Triassic's [[climate]] was very different from today's: < ref name=brit/ > 
 :#It had about 80% of today's [[oxygen]] levels 
 :#There was about six times as much [[carbon dioxide]] in the air as there was before the [[Industrial Revolution]] 
 :#The Earth's average surface [[temperature]] was about 3 < sup > o < /sup >  [[Celsius|C]] hotter than it is now 
 
 === Paleogeography === 
 [[File:Snider-Pellegrini Wegener fossil map.svg|thumb|center|500px|The distribution of fossils across the continents is one line of evidence pointing to the existence of Pangaea.]] 
 [[File:Pangaea (230 million years ago).png|thumb|300px|Another view of Pangaea in the early Triassic. It makes the point that some of the land areas had large deserts at their centre.]] 
 
 During the Triassic period, there were no separate [[continent]]s as there are today. Almost all the Earth's land mass was together in a single [[supercontinent]] called [[Pangaea]] ( " all the land " ). Pangaea was centred more or less on the [[equator]]. < ref name=brit/ >  and surrounded by the superocean [[Panthalassa]]. Later the [[Tethys Ocean]] developed. 
 
 The supercontinent Pangaea was [[Rift (geology)|rifting]] during the Triassic – especially late in the period – but had not yet separated again into different continents. In contrast to the present Earth with its distribution of continents, Pangaea was centred on the Equator. Probably, apart from some volcanic island chains, there was an unbroken sea stretching round the world: the ''Panthalassa''.   
 
 Being a super-continental land mass, Pangaea had a limited [[shore]]line. Because of this, Triassic marine deposits {{ndash}} [[fossil]]s from Triassic ocean life {{ndash}} are rare in most of the world. In [[North America]], for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. However, they are common in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. < ref name=brit/ > 
 
 == Major adaptive radiations == 
 {{See also|Adaptive radiation}} 
 
 The first part of the Triassic had much less variety than the Permian, and showed signs of a deteriorated [[environment]]. This situation lasted for about five million years, then steadily improved. Into the vacant [[ecological niche]]s, new forms [[evolution|evolved]], replacing old with new. This rapid [[adaptive radiation]] happened to the [[reptile]]s on land, the [[fish]] in the [[seas]], and a number of other groups, like the [[insect]]s. Communities with complex [[ecology]] took 30 million years to re-establish. < ref name= " Sahney " > {{ cite journal | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | author=Sahney S. and Benton M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | issue=1636 | pages = 759–765| pmid=18198148 | pmc=2596898 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Plants === 
 New groups of [[Fern|ferns]] and [[Seed plants|seed plant]]s were a feature of the Triassic.  
 
 === Fish === 
 The group of [[bony fish]] known as the [[teleost]]s first appeared during the Triassic period. The group now includes over 80% of all fish and 95% of all bony fish. The only other common group of fish are the [[Chondrichthyes]] (the [[shark]]s and [[ray]]s). The rays also first appeared during the Triassic. < ref name=brit/ > 
 
 === Reptiles === 
 Many reptile groups first appeared during the Triassic period, possibly because so many niches were vacant at the time. Some of these new groups died out in the [[End–Triassic extinction event]], but those that survived ruled the Earth for the rest of the Mesozoic. < ref name= " Benton " > Benton M. 1990. ''The reign of the reptiles''. Crescent, New York. {{ISBN|978-0517025574}}. < /ref >  Examples include: 
 *The [[Archosaur]]s, including [[dinosaur]]s and [[crocodile]]s 
 *[[Pterosaur]]s 
 *[[Ichthyosaur]]s 
 *[[Turtle]]s 
 *[[Plesiosaur]]s 
 
 This was a major change, because in the [[middle Triassic]] period, the [[Synapsid]]s ([[mammal]]s' [[ancestor]]s) were still dominant. 
 
 == The end-Triassic extinction == 
 {{Main|End-Triassic extinction event}} 
 Many reptile groups became [[extinction|extinct]] during the Triassic, including: < ref name= " Benton "  / > < sup > p. & nbsp;41 < /sup > 
 *Crocodilian Archosaurs: 
 *: [[Ornithosuchia]] 
 *: [[Aetosaur]]s 
 *: [[Pseudosuchia]] 
 *Other Archosaurs: 
 *: [[Euparkeria]] 
 *: [[Erythrosuchus]] 
 *: [[Proterosuchus]] 
 *Proto-Archosaurs 
 *: [[Rhynchosaur]]s 
 *: [[Trilophosaur]]s 
 
 Also, amongst the Synapsids (which used to be called [[mammal-like reptile]]s), the [[Dicynodont]]s died out during the end-Triassic extinction. < ref name= " Benton "  / > < sup > p. & nbsp;41 < /sup > 
 
 The Triassic was a period of great change in [[tetrapod]]s: many new and important groups appeared, but many others became extinct. Of all the periods in the Mesozoic era, there are the least number of [[fossil]]s from the Triassic period. This makes it difficult for [[scientist]]s to explain these events.
