 '''''Maiasaura''''' was a large, plant-eating, [[duck]]-billed [[dinosaur]]. ''Maiasaura'' was the first dinosaur which was found alongside its young, [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], and [[nest]]s. This suggests that ''Maiasaura'' nurtured its young. 
 
 == About ''Maiasaura'' == 
 ''Maiasaura'' lived about 80 to 65 million years ago in the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period. It ate [[plant]]s, [[leaf|leaves]] and [[berry|berries]]. Its name ''Maiasaura'' means “Good Mother Lizard”. The name refers to the find of nests with eggs, embryos and young animals, in a nesting colony. These showed that Maiasaura fed its young while they were in the nest. It was the first time such evidence was got for a dinosaur.  
 
 Fully grown ''Maiasaura'' measured about 9 & nbsp;metres long, 2-2.5 [[metre]]s tall and weighed around 1800 [[kilogram|kg]]. 
 
 == Where they lived == 
 ''Maiasaursa'' fossils have been found in [[Montana]], [[United States]], and [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. < ref name= " cdnsciencepub.com " > {{Cite journal|last1=McFeeters|first1=Bradley D.|last2=Evans|first2=David C.|last3=Ryan|first3=Michael J.|last4=Maddin|first4=Hillary C.|date=2021-03-01|title=First occurrence of Maiasaura (Dinosauria, Hadrosauridae) from the Upper Cretaceous Oldman Formation of southern Alberta, Canada|url=https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjes-2019-0207|journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=58|issue=3|pages=286–296|doi=10.1139/cjes-2019-0207|bibcode=2021CaJES..58..286M|s2cid=233851376|issn=0008-4077}} < /ref >
