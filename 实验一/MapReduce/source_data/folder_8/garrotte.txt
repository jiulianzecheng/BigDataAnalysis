 ==Assassination weapon== 
 The garrote has been used for centuries for silent [[assassination]]. < ref name=NEW/ >  It was widely used in 17th and 18th century [[India]] by the [[Thuggee]] [[cult]]. < ref name=NEW/ >  A garrote can be made out of many materials, including slik scarves, ropes, [[cable tie]]s, fishing lines, nylon, and even guitar strings, telephone cord and [[piano wire]]. < ref name=NEW/ > < ref name=WHI > Whittaker, Wayne 1943.

''Black Belt Magazine'', (August) '''24''' #8, pp. 48-49 < /ref >  The Indian version of the garrote often had a knot at the center to crush the [[larynx]] while applying pressure to the victim's back, usually by means of a foot or knee. 
 
 A stick may be used to tighten the garrotte (the Spanish word actually refers to the stick itself). In Spanish, the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a [[torture]] device. < ref name=NEW/ > < ref name=DRAE > ''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2 & TIPO_BUS=3 & LEMA=garrote#0_7 garrote]'', 7th sense, ''Diccionario de la Real Academia Española''. < /ref > 
 
 Since World War II the garrotte has been regularly used as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of eliminating (taking out) sentries and other enemy [[personnel]]. < ref name=WHI/ > < ref name=STE/ >  Instruction in the use of garrottes is in the training of many elite military units and special forces. < ref name=STE/ >  A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire; the wire is looped over a sentry's head and pulled taut in one motion. < ref name=WHI/ > < ref name=STE/ >  Soldiers of the [[French Foreign Legion]] used a particular type of double-loop garrotte (referred to as ''la loupe''), where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victim's neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils, he only succeeds in tightening the other. < ref name=STE/ >

 The garrote was the main device used for [[capital punishment]] in Spain for hundreds of years. Originally, it was an execution where the convict was killed by hitting him with a club (''garrote'' in Spanish). This later developed into a strangulation device, where the condemned was tied to a wooden stake, with a loop of rope placed around his neck. A wooden stick was placed in the loop, and by rotating the stick, the rope was tightened until the condemned person was strangled to death. As time went on, the execution method was modified in the form of a wooden chair to which the condemned was bound, while the [[executioner]] tightened a metal band around his/her neck with a crank or a wheel until [[asphyxia]]tion of the condemned person was accomplished. 
 
 Other versions of this device incorporated a fixed metal blade or spike directed at the [[spinal cord]] to cause the breaking of the neck. Such a device can be seen in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', the Coppola classic ''[[The Godfather]]'', and the Banderas/Jolie film, ''[[Original Sin (2001 film)|Original Sin]]''. The spiked version, called the Catalan garrotte, was used as late as 1940. American authorities kept the garrotte for a time in the [[Philippines]] after that Spanish colony was captured in 1898.  Its use was abolished in 1902 (Act No. 451, passed 2 September 1902). 
 
 American military authorities in [[Puerto Rico]] used the garrotte to execute at least five convicted murderers in 1900. In a report to Congress, the American military governor said  " that execution by the garrotte is far less inhumane and revolting than execution by hanging " . < ref > S. Doc. 360, 56th Cong., 1st sess., p. 3. < /ref >  However, the method was replaced by [[hanging]]. Since 1929, capital punishment has not existed under Puerto Rican law. 
 
 In the [[Ottoman Empire]], execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version, a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AluFxq_GeLMC & dq=execution+by+the+bowstring & pg=PA74|title=The Ottoman Empire: the classical ... - Google Books|publisher=|accessdate=2009-09-16|first=Halil|last=Inalcik|year=2000|isbn=978-1-84212-442-0}} < /ref > 
 
 The garrotte ({{lang-la|laqueus}}) is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the [[Catiline#Second Catilinian Conspiracy|Second Catiline Conspiracy]], where conspirators were strangled with a ''laqueus''. The implement is shown in some early reliefs, e.g., ''Répertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains'', tome I, p. & nbsp;341 (1919). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mediterranees.net/civilisation/Rich/Articles/Supplices/Laqueus.html|title=Laqueus|publisher=Mediterranees.net|accessdate=2009-09-16}} < /ref >  It was also used in the [[Middle Ages]] in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquista]] of the Americas, notably in the execution of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emperor [[Atahualpa]]. 
 
 During the [[Peninsular War#Course of the war|Peninsular War]] of 1808–1814, French forces regularly used the garrotte to execute Spanish ''guerrilleros'', priests, and other opponents to Napoleonic rule. Around 1810 the earliest known metallic garrotte appeared in Spain, and on 28 April 1828, the garrotte was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country. 
 
 In May 1897, the last public garrotting in Spain was performed in [[Barcelona]]. After that, all executions were performed inside prisons. In 1935 in Spain the legislature adopted a law prohibiting any member of the armed forces from being a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. As a result of this edict, 80 Freemasons were garrotted to death in [[Málaga]]. < ref > Scottish Rite News Bureau bulletin,15 February 1937, in the files at the Scottish Rite House of the Temple in Washington, DC. < /ref >  This was one of the many issues that led to unrest that became the [[Spanish Civil War]]. 
 
 The last civilian executions in Spain by garrotting were in March 1974. Two men both convicted of killing police officers: they were the last state-sanctioned garrotings in Spain. In Spain, the garrote was abolished in 1978 along with the death penalty after adoption of a new constitution. 
 
 In 1990, [[Andorra]] became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garroting, though this method had not been used there since the late 19th century.
