 '''''Eritherium''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of early [[Proboscidea]]n.

 The [[phosphate]] [[bed (geology)|bed]] where the remains were found places the animal's age as 61.1 to 57.8 million years ago. 
 
 ''Eritherium'' is the oldest known representative of the Proboscideans. It has not been assigned to any family in the order. ''Eritherium'' is the sister [[clade]] to ''[[Phosphatherium]]'', ''[[Numidotherium]]'' and ''[[Moeritherium]]''. This is one of the most complete [[evolutionary]] sequences of early mammalian [[adaptive radiation|radiations]] after the [[K/T extinction event]]. Thus, the [[elephants]] are one of the oldest  " modern "  mammal orders to have survived.
