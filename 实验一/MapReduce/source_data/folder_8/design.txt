'''Design''' is the visual appearence or [[shape]] given to an object. Design aims to make things prettier, more comfortable, or better in some way by making them work well and look good. 
 
 Good design decisions can make a space, for example, a [[hospital]] or an [[airport]], more [[Accessibility|accessible]] or an [[Picture|image]] more attractive for [[Advertising|advertisements]], adding value in the market. 
 
 [[Designer|Designers]] use knowledge and rules from [[geometry]] and [[art]] to create their designs. 
 
 Design is sometimes divided to sub-categories, including [[graphic design]], [[interior design]], [[vehicle]] design, [[furniture]] design, [[Product (business)|product]] design, [[Typography|type design]], [[fashion design]] and [[web design]], to name a few. 
 
 Design doesn't always lead to physical objects; it can involve [[Computer program|applications]], [[Website|websites]], [[Prototype|prototypes]], [[Presentation|presentations]], or serve as a plan for creating something else. 
 
 Design is also a [[concept]] used to create an object (virtual or not). Design is picturing things using the [[imagination]]; as to using perception or [[memory]].
