 '''Atropa''' is a [[genus]] of flowering plants, in the [[nightshade]] family. They are [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[perennial]]s, with large leaves, and shiny berries. These berries are particularly dangerous to children, because they look like cherries, but they are highly [[poison]]ous. < ref > ''A Colour Atlas of Poisonous Plants : A Handbook for Pharmacists, Doctors, Toxicologists, and Biologists'' by Frohne, Dietrich and Pfänder, Hans Jürgen of University of Kiel, translated from second German edition by Norman Grainger Bisset, London : a Wolfe Science Book and one of the volumes in the illustrated series Wolfe Atlases, pub. Wolfe Publishing Ltd. 1984. < /ref >   Atropa species prefer [[temperate]] climates and [[alkaline]] soils. They often grow in light shade in [[woodland]]s near [[limestone]] hills and mountains. < ref > Flora Europaea, Tutin T.G., Heywood V.H. and Burgess N.A. pub.

'she who may not be turned (aside)' - one of the [[Moirai|Three Fates]] and cutter of the thread of life / bringer of death. They are named after her because of the extreme toxicity of ''A. belladonna'' and its fellow species. < ref > {{cite web|author=|date=|title=Atropa — The Plant List|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/1.1/browse/A/Solanaceae/Atropa/|website=www.theplantlist.org|accessdate=24 September 2018}} < /ref > < ref > The Biology and Taxonomy of the Solanaceae edited by Hawkes, J.G., Lester, R.N. and Skelding, A.D.
