 '''GRU'''  < ref > ''Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye'': [[Russian language|Russian]]: Главное разведывательное управление < /ref >  is in the [[military intelligence]] service of the [[Russian Federation]], (formerly the [[Red Army]] of the [[Soviet Union]]). 
 
 " GRU "  is the [[English language|English]] version of the [[Russian language|Russian]] [[acronym]] '''ГРУ''', which means '''Main Intelligence Directorate'''. 
 
 The GRU is Russia's largest foreign intelligence agency. < ref > [https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE53N3K820090424 Reuters factbox on Russian military intelligence by Dmitry Solovyov] < /ref >  In 1997 it had six times as many agents in foreign countries as the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (The SVR is the successor to the [[KGB]]'s foreign operations directorate). The GRU commanded 25,000 [[Spetsnaz]] ('special') troops in 1997. < ref > The current GRU Director is Lieutenent General Igor Sergun.{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/27/press-digest-russia-dec-idUSL6E7NR06E20111227 | work=Reuters | title=PRESS DIGEST & nbsp;– Russia & nbsp;– Dec 27 | date=27 December 2011 | access-date=31 August 2017 | archive-date=17 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017185001/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/27/press-digest-russia-dec-idUSL6E7NR06E20111227 | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 The GRU's first predecessor in post-tsarist Russia was created on October 21, 1918 under the sponsorship of [[Leon Trotsky]], who was then the civilian overseer of the Red Army. < ref > Earl F. Ziemke, ''Russian Review'' 60(2001): 130. < /ref >  It was originally known as the Registration Directorate (''Registrupravlenie'', or RU). In his history of the early years of the GRU, Raymond W. Leonard writes: < blockquote > 
 " As originally established, the Registration Department was not directly subordinate to the General Staff [of] the Red Army... In 1921... it was elevated in status to become the Second (Intelligence) Directorate of the Red Army Staff. < ref name=Leonard > Leonard, Raymond W. 1999. ''Secret soldiers of the Revolution'': Soviet military intelligence, 1918-1933. Westport, Conn.  &  London: Greenwood Press.  xiv, 7. {{ISBN|0-313-30990-6}} < /ref >

 It was given the task of handling all [[military intelligence]], particularly the collection of intelligence of military or political significance from sources outside the Soviet Union.  The GRU operated residencies all over the world. They ran with the SIGINT ([[signals intelligence]]) in [[Cuba]], and throughout the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bloc countries, especially in [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], and [[Estonia]]. 
 
 The GRU was well known in the Soviet government for its fierce independence from the rival  " [[secret police|internal intelligence organizations]] " , such as [[NKVD]] and [[KGB]].  At the time of the GRU's creation, Lenin infuriated the [[Cheka]] (predecessor of the KGB) by ordering it not to interfere with the GRU's operations.  Nonetheless, the Cheka infiltrated the GRU in 1919.  This planted the seed for a fierce rivalry between the two agencies, which were both engaged in espionage. The rivalry was even more intense than that between the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]]. 
 
 The existence of the GRU was not publicized during the Soviet era. Documents about it became available in the West in the late 1920s, and it was mentioned in the 1931 memoirs of the first [[OGPU]] defector, Georges Agabekov. Walter Krivitsky, the most senior Red Army intelligence officer ever to defect, described it in detail in his 1939 autobiography (''I was Stalin's agent''). < ref name=Leonard/ > 
 
 It became widely known in Russia, and the [[Western world|West]]  during [[perestroika]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]] (Vladimir Rezun), a GRU agent who defected to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in 1978, wrote about his experiences in the Soviet military and intelligence services.  According to Suvorov, even the General Secretary of the [[CPSU]] could not enter GRU headquarters without going through a security screening. 
 
 The GRU is still a very important part of the Russian Federation's intelligence services, especially since it was never split up like the KGB. < ref name= " reuters.com " > [https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE53N21920090424 Reuters Russia's Medvedev sacks military spy chief by Dmitry Solovyov Fri Apr 24, 2009] < /ref >   The KGB was dissolved after aiding a failed [[coup]] in 1991 against the then Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. It has since been divided into the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Federal Security Service (FSB). 
 
 The GRU was officially dissolved on 7 May 1992. It continues as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces.
