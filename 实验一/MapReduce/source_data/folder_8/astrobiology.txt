 '''Astrobiology''' is the study of [[life]] in [[outer space]]. The field of astrobiology looks for conditions necessary for life, such as liquid [[water]] or a similar substitute, a good [[temperature]], or the presence of [[oxygen]]. 
 
 Some possible places to find life in the [[solar system]] are [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/714572/LIVE-NASA-surprising-activity-Jupiter-Europa |title='There may be ALIENS on Europa' Scientists say Jupiter's moon has key ingredients for LIFE |publisher=express.co.uk |accessdate=18 July 2017 |date=27 September 2016}} < /ref >  [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], moons of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]], or [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] < ref > {{cite web |url=http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast105/making_sense.php.html |title=Cassini: Making sense of the news |publisher=[[New Mexico State University]] |accessdate=18 July 2017 |archive-date=20 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420161349/http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast105/making_sense.php.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and [[Enceladus]], both moons of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. Some of these places may have liquid water, or, in the case of Titan, [[Hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] that could support a different type of life. They may be too cold to support life on their surfaces, but if they have liquid water, the water must be warm enough to support life. Astrobiologists suggest that there may be a liquid water ocean under their surfaces.
