 '''Scotland''' ({{lang-sco|Scotland}}, {{lang-gd|[[Alba]]}} {{IPA-gd|ˈal̪ˠapə||Alba-gd.ogg}}) is one of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|four countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Scotland located on the northern third of [[Great Britain]]. Many other islands in the [[British Isles]] are also part of Scotland. To the south of Scotland is [[England]], the [[North Sea]] is to the east, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is to the west and the [[Irish Sea]] is to the south-west. 
 
 The [[capital city]] of Scotland is [[Edinburgh]] on the east coast, but the biggest city is [[Glasgow]] on the west coast. The other cities in Scotland are [[Aberdeen]], [[Dundee]], [[Inverness]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Stirling]] and [[Dunfermline]]. About five million people live in Scotland. Most of the population lives in the Central Belt, an area between the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. 
 
 Unlike most of Great Britain, most of Scotland was not part of the [[Roman Empire]] (only the southern half of Scotland -then named Caledonia- was under roman control for a century) and did not become part of [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. The [[Kingdom of Scotland]] started in the 9th century AD. In [[1603]], [[James VI and I|James VI]] of Scotland inherited the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. In [[1707]], the [[parliament of Scotland]] joined with the [[parliament of England]] to become the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. This formed the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom of Great Britain]]. This kingdom joined with the Kingdom of Ireland in [[1801]] to make the modern [[United Kingdom]].

 Because of where Scotland is in the world and its strong [[wikt:reliance|reliance]] on trade routes by sea, the nation held close links in the south and east with the Baltic countries, and through Ireland with France and Europe. The sea was very important for trade reasons. Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], Scotland grew to be one of the largest commercial, intellectual and industrial states in Europe. 
 
 === Caledonians, Picts, and Romans === 
 {{Main|Ancient Britons|Roman Britain}} 
 
 The written history of Scotland begins when the [[Roman Empire]] came to the British Isles. The Romans gave Great Britain its name in {{Lang-la|Britannia}} or {{Lang-la|Britannia Maior|lit=Great Britain|label=none}}. The Romans overcame and controlled what is now [[England]], [[Wales]], and southern Scotland. To the north of the [[River Forth]] was ''Caledonia'', land not fully owned by the Romans < ref > [https://adviceandresearch.blogspot.com/2019/11/romans-in-caledonia-actual-scotland.html?showComment=1643561414923#c1662115457572177349 Romans in Caledonia] < /ref > ). 
 
 The Romans had military [[camp]]s and [[Fortification|forts]] in much of Scotland. In [[Classical Antiquity]], the Romans named the people in Caledonia in {{Lang-la|Caledonii|lit=Caledonians|label=none}}. During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], the people of Caledonia were the [[Picts]]. The [[Roman army]] left Great Britain in the 5th [[century]], and by the time Roman military had fought many battles with the Picts. 
 
 === Scoti, Picts, and Saxons === 
 [[File:Skotte.jpg|thumb|right|Scots soldier playing [[Bagpipes|bagpipe]]]] 
 
 In the Early Middle Ages, the Picts lived in a part of the land with the name [[Pictland]]. The Scoti came from Ireland and started the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]]. Parts of south-western Scotland and northern Ireland were part of Dál Riata. People there spoke old [[Goidelic languages]]. The Saxons came from [[Continental Europe]]. In the British Isles they have the name [[Anglo-Saxons]]. South-eastern Scotland became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. Their language was [[Old English]]. 
 
 In Pictland, the Picts started the [[Kingdom of Alba]] in the 9th-century. The kingdom began in the land between the [[River Spey]] and the [[River Forth]]. The [[Pictish language]] went [[extinct]], and people in the 10th-century kingdom of Alba spoke the Goidelic language, [[Scots Gaelic]]. In time, the kingdom grew. The lands of [[Moray]] and [[Angus]] became part of the kingdom. The northern parts of [[Northumbria]], south of the [[River Forth]], became part of the kingdom. 
 
 People began to build large towns in the 10th century. 
 
 === Norse === 
 Most of the Scottish islands were ruled by the [[Norse]] (and then by [[Norway|Norwegians]] and [[Denmark|Danes]]) for over four hundred years. The [[Kingdom of the Isles]] was a Norse kingdom in the western, [[coastal]] parts of Scotland. They spoke the [[Old Norse language]]. 
 
 The Norse lands include the [[Hebrides]] to the west and [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] to the north. The [[Isle of Man]] was also a part of the Kingdom of the Isles. The islands still have a culture of their own. 
 
 ====Wars of Independence==== 
 {{main|Wars of Scottish Independence}} 
 The [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] were many military [[campaign]]s fought between Scotland and [[Kingdom of England|England]] in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. 
 
 The First War (1296–1328) began with the [[Edward I of England]]'s invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]] in 1328. The Second War (1332–1357) began with the English-supported invasion of Scotland by [[Edward Balliol]] and the 'Disinherited' in 1332, and ended around 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]]. 
 
 The wars were part of a great national crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most important moments in the nation's history. At the end of both wars, Scotland was an [[independent]] kingdom. The wars were also important for other reasons, such as the invention of the [[longbow]] as an important weapon in [[medieval warfare]]. 
 
 A series of deaths in the line of succession in the 1280s, followed by King [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]'s death in 1286 left the Scottish crown in crisis. His granddaughter, [[Margaret I of Scotland|Margaret, the  " Maid of Norway " ]], a four-year-old girl, was the heir. 
 
 [[Edward I of England]], as Margaret's great-uncle, suggested that his son (also a child) and Margaret should marry, stabilising the Scottish line of succession. In 1290 Margaret's guardians agreed to this, but Margaret herself died in [[Orkney]] on her voyage from Norway to Scotland before she was made Queen, or her wedding could take place. 
 
 Because there was no clear heir to the throne anymore, the Scottish people decided to ask Edward I of England to choose their king. The strongest candidate was called [[Robert Bruce]]. Robert Bruce had castles all around the country, and had a private army. But Edward wanted to invade Scotland, so he chose the weaker candidate, who was [[John I of Scotland|John Balliol]]. He had the strongest claim to the throne, and became king on 30 November 1292. Robert Bruce decided to accept this decision (his grandson and [[wikt:namesake|namesake]] later took the throne as Robert I). 
 
 Over the next few years, Edward I kept trying to undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295, John, on the recommendation of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with [[France]]. This was the beginning of the [[Auld Alliance]]. 
 
 In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland. He removed King John from power, and put him in jail. The following year [[William Wallace]] and [[Andrew de Moray]] raised an army from the southern and northern parts of the country to fight the English. Under their joint leadership, an English army was defeated at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]]. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm. 
 
 Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] in 1298. Wallace escaped but resigned as Guardian of Scotland. [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] were put in his place. In 1305 Wallace was captured by the English, who executed him for treason. Wallace claimed he did not commit treason as he was not loyal to England. 
 [[File:Robert the Bruce.jpg|Robert Bruce|thumb|200px|right]] 
 
 In February 1306 Robert Bruce murdered John Comyn, a leading rival, in a [[Church (building)|church]]. Bruce went on to take the crown, but Edward's army overran the country yet again after defeating Bruce's small army at the [[Battle of Methven]]. Despite the [[excommunication]] of Bruce and his followers by [[Pope Clement V]], his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314, with the help of leading nobles such as [[Sir James Douglas]] and the [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Earl of Moray]], only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling were still under English control. 
 
 Edward I died in [[Carlisle]] in 1307. His heir, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], moved an army north to break the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] and again take control. Robert defeated that army at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, securing temporary independence. In 1320, a letter to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland (the [[Declaration of Arbroath]]) went part of the way towards convincing [[Pope John XXII]] to overturn the earlier excommunication and cancel the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's independence could be recognised by other European countries. 
 
 In 1326, the first full [[Parliament of Scotland]] met. The parliament was made from an earlier council of nobility and clergy around 1235, but in 1326 representatives of the burghs—the burgh commissioners—joined them to form the Three Estates. 
 
 In 1328, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] signed the [[Treaty of Northampton]] which declared Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce. Four years after Robert's death in 1329, England invaded Scotland yet again, looking to put the  " Rightful King " —[[Edward Balliol]], son of John Balliol—to the Scottish throne, starting the Second War of Independence. In the face of tough Scottish resistance, led by [[Sir Andrew Murray]], attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed. Edward III lost interest in Balliol after the outbreak of the [[Hundred Years' War]] with France. In 1341 [[David II of Scotland|David II]], King Robert's son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his empty claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364. 
 
 ==== Union of the Crowns ==== 
 {{Main|Union of the Crowns}} 
 
 In 1603, [[Elizabeth I]], queen of England and of Ireland, died. The king of Scotland was the queen's [[heir apparent]], and [[James VI of Scotland]] (son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]) became king of England and king of Ireland. James VI and I (from Scotland's [[House of Stuart]]) went to England to control the government, and none of Scotland's kings came to Scotland for more than one hundred years. 
 
 === United Kingdom === 
 In 1707, Scotland and England were joined in the [[Act of Union]] to make one big Kingdom, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. When [[Ireland]] joined in 1801, the [[United Kingdom]] was created. Scotland was an important part of the [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]] of the [[British Empire]]. Scots [[colonist]]s [[emigrated]] throughout the empire, and a large [[diaspora]] of Scots lives throughout the world as a result. The [[Scottish Enlightenment]] was an important part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Philosophers like [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] led the Scottish Enlightenment. 
 
 Soldiers fought some of the wars caused by [[Jacobitism]] in Scotland. The Jacobites wanted the [[Roman Catholic]] [[House of Stuart]], and not the [[Protestant]] [[House of Hanover]] to be kings of Britain and of Ireland. The last land battle in Great Britain was the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1745. At that time the government's [[British Army]] stopped the Catholic [[rebellion]] led by [[Charles Edward Stuart]]. Scots-speakers and English-speakers moved many Gaelic speakers off lands in the Scottish Highlands, and many [[emigrated]] to the British Empire and the [[United States]]. In the 19th century, [[George IV]] visited Scotland. After that, Scotland and Scottish culture became more popular. [[Tourism]] to Scotland started in the 19th century.

 In a [[referendum]] in 1997, a majority of voters in Scotland chose to have political [[devolution]]. The [[Scottish Parliament]], [[Scottish Government]], and the office of [[First Minister of Scotland|first minister of Scotland]] was set up in 1999. 
 
 One first minister of Scotland, [[Alex Salmond]], led the [[Scottish National Party]]'s Scottish Government from 2007. in 2014, the [[Scottish independence referendum]] ended in a majority (55%) voting against independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Nicola Sturgeon]] became first minister on 20 November 2014.

Scotland's land also includes several islands, including the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]] off the west coast and the [[archipelago]]es of [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] to the north of the mainland. 
 
 Compared to the other areas of the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, Scotland is sparsely populated, most especially the north-western half of it. The main geographical feature that dictates this is the [[Highland Boundary Fault]] which roughly splits the country in half from the southwest to the northeast. 
 
 To the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault are the more mountainous [[Scottish Highlands]] and islands, and this half of the country contains less than 5% of the total population.  To the south and east of the Highland Boundary Fault is the [[Scottish Lowlands]], which contain the vast majority (about 75%) of the Scottish population, and 3 of the 4 biggest cities ([[Glasgow]] which is 1st, [[Edinburgh]] which is 2nd, and Dundee which is 4th).  Below the lowlands are the Southern Uplands which are hilly, but not as hilly at the Highlands.  They are less densely populated than the lowlands, but still a lot more dense than the highlands and islands. 
 
 Located within the central part of the lowlands is the  " Central Belt " , a rectangle of land roughly 88 kilometres (55 miles) from West to East and 48 kilometres (30 miles) North to South.  About half of the population of Scotland lives within these roughly 4,530 square kilometres (or 1,750 square miles), which is a little more than 2% of the total land area of Scotland.  This is the area between Scotland’s two largest cities - Glasgow, at the Central Belt’s Western end, and Edinburgh, at the Central Belt’s Eastern end.  This area is geographically bound by two bays of water – the Firth of Clyde to the West and the Firth of Forth to the East.  It is the most fertile Earth in Scotland, which is why it is so population-dense, compared to the rest of the country.
