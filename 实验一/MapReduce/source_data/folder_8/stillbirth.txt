A '''stillbirth''' happens when a [[fetus]] (unborn baby) dies while still inside the mother or dies during delivery ([[childbirth]]). It is said that the delivered baby is ''stillborn''. Stillbirth is different from a [[miscarriage]] because a stillbirth happens after the baby has been living inside its mother 20 to 24 weeks (depending on the country). It is called a miscarriage if the baby lived inside the mother for less time. 
 
 == Causes == 
 The causes of many stillbirths are unknown, even when [[autopsy|special tests]] are done to learn the cause. 
 *[[nicotine]], [[alcohol]], or [[drug]]s taken by the mother during [[pregnancy]] 
 *[[physical trauma]] 
 *[[radiation]] poisoning 
 *[[Rh disease]] 
 *[[umbilical cord]] problems 
 
 == Occurrence == 
 The number of stillbirths in the [[United States]] is about 1 in 115 births, which is about 26,000 a year, or one every 20 minutes. In [[developing country|developing countries]], where medical care is not as advanced or good, the number of stillbirths is higher.  
 
 In [[Australia]], [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], the rate is about 1 in 200 babies. < ref name= " Aust-stat " > {{cite web | last = Gordon | first = Adrienne (Dr) | title = Department of Neonatal Medicine Protocol Book: Royal Prince Alfred Hospital | url = http://www.cs.nsw.gov.au/rpa/neonatal/html/newprot/stillbirths.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-13 | archive-date = 2006-09-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060912090555/http://www.cs.nsw.gov.au/rpa/neonatal/html/newprot/stillbirths.htm | url-status = dead }} < /ref >

 The death of the baby is usually treated like the death of an older baby.  The family may have a [[funeral]]. The body of the dead baby can be [[Burial|buried]] or [[Cremation|cremated]] (burned).  In some places, there are special places for putting the bodies or the ashes of stillborn babies. 
 
 The mother may be ill.  Her body may be hurt from having the baby. 
 
 == Legal definitions of stillbirth == 
 === United Kingdom === 
 In the UK, any baby that leaves its mother's body after 24 weeks and does not show any signs of life is called a ''stillbirth''. The mother or father must tell the government about the baby. A Stillbirth Certificate is given to the family.  < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/stillbirths/ |title=Guide to registering stillbirths in the UK |access-date=2007-01-22 |archive-date=2007-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121162814/http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/stillbirths/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === Australia === 
 In Australia, any stillborn fetus that weighs more than 400 grams and lived in the mother for more than 20 weeks must be reported to the government. 
 
 === United States === 
 The United States does not have a formal definition of ''stillborn'' babies.  < ref name= " CDC-def " > {{cite book | author =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | authorlink=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=State Definitions and Reporting Requirements |  edition=1997 Revision | publisher =National Center for Health Statistics | url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/itop97.pdf}} < /ref >  All pregnancies are legally called either: ''live birth'', ''fetal death'', or ''induced termination of pregnancy'' ([[abortion]]). The law does not have a difference between a stillbirth and a miscarriage. However, it is recommended to register infants who weighed over 350 grams or who lived over 19 weeks inside the mother before dying.
