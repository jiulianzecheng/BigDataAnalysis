 '''Hobbits''' are a fictional race in the [[Middle-earth]] world invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], also often called ''halflings''. 
 
 They appeared in the books ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Several important main characters in those books are hobbits, such as [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Frodo Baggins]].  
 
 Hobbits (or similar beings) have become very popular and are now often used in [[fantasy]] [[fiction]] and ([[Video game|video]]) [[games]]. 
 
 == Appearance == 
 Hobbits are like small [[humans]] between two and four foot tall (between 60 and 120 centimeters). They have [[hair]]/[[fur]] on the top side of their [[Foot|feet]], leathery foot-soles, and slightly pointed [[ear]]s. They tend to be stout and often have brown and curly hair. Male hobbits do not have [[beard]]s. Hobbits live longer compared to humans, and many hobbits reach the age of 100. 
 
 == Culture == 
 Hobbits are a peaceful people and live a simple, pre-industrial life in the land which they call [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]], and also in [[Bree-land]]. 
 
 A typical hobbit-house has a long hallway with rooms on both sides, and round doors and windows. Originally these were underground in hills, then the house was called a ''smial''; but this [[architecture]](style of building) is also used for 'normal' houses above ground.
