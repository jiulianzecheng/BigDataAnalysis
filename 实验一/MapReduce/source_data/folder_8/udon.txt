 {{nihongo|'''Udon'''|うどん}} is a type of thick, [[wheat]]-based [[noodle]] popular in [[Japan]]ese [[cuisine]]. 
 
 Udon is most often served hot as a [[noodle soup]] in a mild, salty [[broth]]. Its simplest form is called ''kake udon''. This consists only of [[dashi]] stock, [[soy sauce]] (''shōyu''), [[mirin]], and ''udon'' noodles. Different things can be put on top of the soup as toppings. Often thinly cut [[scallion]]s are used, along with other common toppings such as [[kamaboko]], [[prawn]] or vegetable [[tempura]], some spices, and [[wakame]]. 
 
 The [[flavor]] of the broth and toppings, as well as even noodle texture and thickness, is different from region to region. Usually, dark brown broth made from dark [[soy sauce]] (''koikuchi shōyu'') is common in eastern Japan. Light brown broth made from light soy sauce (''usukuchi shōyu'') is common in western Japan. However, many other regional types exist outside of just broth color and mainly vary in toppings used. 
 
 [[Kagawa Prefecture]] is famous for using udon as a [[staple food]].
