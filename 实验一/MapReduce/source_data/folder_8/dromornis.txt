 '''''Dromornis''''' is a [[genus]] of [[fossil]] [[flightless birds]]. It lived in [[Australia]] from the late [[Miocene]] to the early [[Pliocene]]. This means early humans never met this animal.  
 
 ''Dromornis'' had a huge beak and jaw capable of great force. It did not have the typical beak and claws of a [[carnivore]], and its life style is not certain. Though they looked like giant [[emu]]s, the ''Dromornis'' are more closely related to [[geese]].  
 
 ''Dromornis stirtoni'' was three metres (10 & nbsp;feet) tall and weighed up to half a ton (500 kilos). It inhabited subtropical open woodland in [[Australia]] during the late [[Miocene]]. It may have been partly [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. It was heavier than the  [[Moa]] and taller than ''[[Aepyornis]]''.  
 
 ''D. stirtoni'' had a long neck and stub-like wings, so it was flightless. < ref name= " EllisNTB " > {{cite book| last = Ellis| first = Richard| authorlink = | title = No turning back: the life and death of animal species| url = https://archive.org/details/noturningbacklif00elli| publisher = Harper Perennial | date = 2004| location = New York| isbn =0-06-055804-0| page = [https://archive.org/details/noturningbacklif00elli/page/102 102] }} < /ref >  Its legs were powerful, but it was not a fast runner. < ref name= " EllisNTB " / >  The bird's beak was large and immensely powerful, leading early researchers to believe that it was used to shear through tough plant stalks. < ref name= " EllisNTB " / >  However, others have argued that the size of the beak suggests that the bird was a carnivore. < ref name= " EllisNTB " / >  There were forests and a permanent water supply where the ''Dromornis'' birds lived, although the climate was unpredictable. 
 
 ''Dromornis'' are part of a family of giant birds called Dromornithidae that lived from 15 million years ago until less than 30,000 years ago. [[Australasia]] had started to separate from other continents as [[Gondwana]] started to break up in the [[Mesozoic]] era.  
 
 Australia's last connection with [[Antarctica]] broke about 40 million years ago. Since then the animals of Australasia (Australia and [[New Guinea]]) evolved slowly in almost complete isolation from the animals of other continents, except for the occasional immigrant [[species]] from [[Asia]].
