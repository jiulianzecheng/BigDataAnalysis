 '''Hawaii''' (sometimes spelled  " Hawai'i " ) is a [[U.S. state]] and the only U.S. State that is in [[Oceania]]. It is the last state that joined the [[United States]], becoming a state on August 21, 1959. It is the only state made only of [[island]]s. Hawaii is also the name of the largest island. The [[Capital (city)|capital]] and largest city of Hawaii is [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] on the island named [[Oahu]]. 
 
 ==Name== 
 Hawaii is known as the  " Aloha State " . ''Aloha'' is a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word that has many meanings like welcome, hello and goodbye. Aloha also means love and care. The different meanings are brought together in the term  " Aloha Spirit "  to describe the friendly people of Hawaii. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Hawaii is an [[archipelago]], a long chain of islands. There are eight main islands and many small islands and [[atoll]]s. They are the tops of underwater [[volcano]]s. The main islands are [[Niihau]], [[Kauai]], [[Oahu]], [[Molokai]], [[Lanai]], [[Kahoolawe]], [[Maui]] and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The first people of Hawaii were [[Polynesians]]. They came to the islands sometime between 200 and 600 AD. [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] discovered the islands in 1778. Others may have been there before him. Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands for the fourth [[Earl of Sandwich]], John Montague. 
 
 [[Kamehameha I]] was the first [[king]] of Hawaii. He united the separate small Hawaiian kingdoms into one large kingdom in 1795. In 1893, American soldiers stopped Queen [[Liliuokalani]] from leading Hawaii when American business people took over the government and made their own laws. She was the last [[monarch]] of Hawaii. She also wrote the original words of the song called ''Aloha Oe''. 
 
 The Americans made Hawaii into a [[republic]] for a short time. The new leader, [[Sanford Dole]] was called the President of Hawaii. In 1898, the United States of America took over the government and made Hawaii into a [[territory]].In 1907, [[University of Hawaiʻi]] is established.  In 1959, Hawaii became the fiftieth American state. In other words, it was taken ( " annexed " ) against the wishes of its native people. Their queen, Lili’uokalani, wrote that “it had not entered into our hearts to believe that these friends and allies from the United States… would ever go so far as to absolutely overthrow our form of government, seize our nation by the throat, and pass it over to an alien power”. < ref > {{Cite book |author=Liliuokalani, Queen of Hawaii |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1262093837 |title=Hawaii's story by Hawaii's Queen |date=February 23, 2021 |isbn=978-1-5132-0902-9 |oclc=1262093837}} < /ref > 
 
 === Reason for statehood === 
 Early in [[World War II]] the U.S. Pacific Fleet was based on the [[Philippines]]. Perceiving that this was not safe, the navy moved its base to the Hawaiian islands, namely [[Oahu]] (the main island in the chain). It was there that the Japanese attacked [[Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam|Pearl Harbor]]. That was significant in the later discussions about the future of the islands. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 The biggest [[industry]] of Hawaii is [[tourism]]. Almost seven [[million]] people visited in 2000. Important [[export]]s are [[sugar]], [[pineapple]], [[macadamia nut]]s, and [[coffee]]. 
 
 Popular [[tourist site]]s include [[Waikiki Beach]], [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]], [[Polynesian Cultural Center]], and the [[USS Arizona Memorial]] at [[Pearl Harbor]]. 
 
 ==State symbols== 
 The state [[flower]] is the yellow [[hibiscus]] (''Hibiscus brackenridgei'' or {{lang|haw|ma'o hau hele}}). The state [[bird]] is the [[Nene|Hawaiian goose]] (nene). The state [[fish]] is the [[reef triggerfish]], also called the ''{{lang|haw|humu humu nuku nuku apua'a}}''. The state [[tree]] is the [[candlenut]], also called ''kukui''. The state [[song]] is [[Hawaii Ponoi]]. The state [[motto]] is ''{{lang|haw|Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono}}''. In English it says, ''The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness''.
