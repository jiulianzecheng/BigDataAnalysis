 The '''Braconidae''' are a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[parasitoid]] [[wasp]]s. They are one of the richest families of [[insect]]s: there are between 50,000 and 150,000 species worldwide. The species are grouped into 45 subfamilies and about 1,000 genera. 
 
 ==Parasitism== 
 Most braconids are [[parasitoid]]s (both external and internal) on other [[insect]]s. Their victims are the [[larvae]] of [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], and [[Lepidoptera]], and also some [[hemimetabolous]] insects such as [[aphid]]s and [[true bugs|bugs]].  
 
 Most species kill their hosts, though some cause the hosts to become [[infertility|sterile]] and less active. The endoparasitoid species lay their eggs inside the victim. They have elaborate [[adaptations]] which improve larval survival inside the host. They have [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] [[viruses]] which disable the host [[immune system|immune defences]]. These [[polydnavirus]]es are often used by the wasps instead of a [[venom]] [[cocktail]].  
 
 The DNA of the wasp actually has bits which are the templates for the viral particles. < ref > Piper, Ross 2007. ''Extraordinary Animals: an encyclopedia of curious and unusual animals''.

 These viruses suppress the larva's immune system and allow the parasitoid to grow inside the host undetected. Through the evolutionary history of being used by the wasps, these viruses apparently have become so modified, they appear unlike any other known viruses today. Because of this highly modified system of host [[immunosuppression]], a high level of parasitoid-host specificity is not surprising. In other words, the viruses need to be a bit different for every host species. 
 
 Parasitism on adult insects (particularly on Hemiptera and Coleoptera) also happens. Members of two subfamilies are known to form [[gall]]s on plants.
