 '''Phulra''' was a minor [[princely state]] of both [[Pakistan]] and [[British India]], in the modern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. It was east of the nearby princely [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]]. Both states ended in 1950 when they were merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. There is some dispute as to whether Phulra ranked as a full princely state or as a minor noble estate (''jagir'') of the [[British India|Indian Empire]]. 
 
 At present, Phulra is a small town and union council in [[Mansehra District]], [[Hazara]], Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
