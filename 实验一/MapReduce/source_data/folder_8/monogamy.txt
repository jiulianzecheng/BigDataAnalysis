'''Monogamy''' ({{lang-gr|μονός+γάμος}}; ''monos+gamos'' meaning ''one+marriage'') is a form of [[marriage]] in which a person or animal has only one [[spouse]] at any one time. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 The word ''monogamy'' comes from the Greek words  " μονός " , ''monos'' which means one or alone, and  " γάμος " , ''gamos'' which means marriage. < ref name= " BRIT " > Cf.  " Monogamy "  in ''Britannica World Language Dictionary'', R.C. Preble (ed.), Oxford-London 1962, p. 1275:''1. The practice or principle of marrying only once. opp. to digamy now ''rare'' 2. The condition, rule or custom of being married to only one [[person]] at a time (opp. to polygamy or bigamy) 1708. 3. [[Zoology|Zool.]] The habit of living in pairs, or having only one mate''; The same text repeats ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', W. Little, H.W. Fowler, J. Coulson (ed.), C.T. Onions (rev.  &  ed.,) Oxford 1969, 3rd edition, vol.1, p.1275; [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00314586 OED Online]. March 2010. Oxford University Press. 23 Jun. 2010  Cf.

 == Religion == 
 Monogamy is one of the [[belief]]s of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. An exception is the [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] branch of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) who strictly follow the teachings of founder [[Joseph Smith]]. Smith allowed [[polygamy]], and had many [[wives]]. In Jewish and Christian [[doctrine]], [[marriage]] is between one [[husband]] and one [[wife]], which is monogamy. 
 
 == Law == 
 In most countries, monogamy is the only [[legal]] form of marriage, either between a man and a woman in most of these countries, and between two persons of the same [[gender]] ([[gay marriage]]) in some of the [[Western world]].  
 In these countries [[polygamy]] is [[:wikt:illegal|illegal]], and a person who has more than one [[spouse]] can be [[:wikt:prosecute|prosecuted]] for [[bigamy]]. 
 
 == Historical angle == 
 [[Polygamy]] without equality was almost universal in ancient human tribes. < ref > Salisbury, Joyce E. 2001. ''Women in the Ancient World''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 142–143. ISBN 9781576070925. < /ref >  By  " without equality "  is meant that of the wives only one would have full rights and recognition as the main wife. 
 
 The fact is that all societies of which we have good records lost men disproportionately, mainly because of warfare, but also accidents in [[hunting]]. This left [[Widow|widows]] who were not responsible for being widows: they were just unlucky. 
 
 It might be thought that this would be counter-balanced by loss of females during child-birth, but apparently not so.  
 A full appreciation of this fact needs to take into account: 
 #On the one hand, the absence of modern medical technology, and  
 #The well-known fact that earlier societies had younger mothers. < ref >  Donald Todman 2007. ''Childbirth in ancient Rome: from tradition folklore to obstetrics''. Australian  &  New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 2007, p83. < /ref > 
 #The life expectancy in prehistoric times was low, 25 & ndash;40 years, < ref > {{cite book |author=Schools History Project |title=Medicine  &  health through time: an SHP Development Study |url=https://archive.org/details/medicinehealthth0000daws |publisher=Hodder Education |date=26 September 1996 |isbn=978-0719552656}} < /ref >  and with men living longer than women; archaeological evidence of women and babies found together suggests that many women would have died in childbirth.
