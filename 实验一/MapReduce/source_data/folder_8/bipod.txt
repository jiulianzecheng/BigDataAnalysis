 A '''bipod''' is a V-shaped portable attachment that helps support and steady a device, usually a weapon such as a long gun or a mortar. The word  " bipod "  comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] words  " bi "  and  " pod " .  " Bi "  means  " two "  and  " pod "  means  " foot " , or  " feet " . < ref > {{cite web|title=Bipod-Definition and More|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bipod|access-date=10 February 2012}} < /ref >  A bipod is sometimes attached to a [[firearm]] to help support it. It also makes it more stable. It gives the best [[wikt:stable|stability]] along two [[Coordinate axis|axes]] of motion: side-to-side and up-and-down.  
 
 ==Firearms== 
 On [[firearm]]s, bipods are often used on [[rifles]] and [[shotguns]] to allow the gun to rest and stop it from moving. They can also be seen on long-[[Barrel (firearms)|barrel]]led weapons. The bipod allows the gunner to rest the weapon on the ground, a short wall or other object. This allows for more [[accuracy]]. Different types of bipods are set up in different ways. Some bipods are a specific length that can not be changed, but some bipods' length can be changed. Mostly, when bipods are not being used, they are folded forwards, not back towards the gunner. Some types of bipod can fold into grips for the gunner to hold to keep the weapon steady. 
 
 When firing a weapon without a bipod, it is harder to aim and keep the weapon steady. < ref > {{cite web|last=Hawks|first=Chuck|title=Choosing the Right Sight|url=https://www.chuckhawks.com/choosing_sights.htm|website=CHUCKHAWKS.com|access-date=10 February 2012}} < /ref > 
 The good thing about having a bipod is that it makes weapons more accurate. At first, the bipod was only used on long-barreled rifles, such as [[snipers]]. However, [[light machine gun|light]] and [[heavy machine gun]]s now use them, as well as small [[pistol]]s. < ref > {{cite web|last=USA Army|title=Infantry Weapons Test Methods|url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/05/0525/A052580.html|access-date=10 February 2012}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >
