 '''Polandball''', also known as '''Countryballs''', is an  [[internet meme]]. The meme began on the /int/ board of Krautchan.net in 2009. The meme takes the form of large number of [[online comics]]. In the comics, [[country|countries]] flags are drawn as a circle shape.  The balls interact in [[broken English]], often referred to as  " Engrish " , (except for those countries who have English as their main language) and ridicule national [[stereotypes]] and [[international relations]]. 
 
 Polandball has its roots in an August 2009 'cyberwar' between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. Drawball.com allows Internet users to draw whatever they want. It also allows people to draw over others drawings. On the Polish flag internet, an idea was raised to draw the [[flag of Poland]] on the ball. Thousands of Poles managed to take over the drawball. The painting consisted of white on top of red. In the middle, the word  " [[Poland|POLSKA]] "  was written. After co-ordination from [[4chan]], this was then covered over by a giant [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[swastika]]. < ref name= " gazeta " > {{cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,86116,7462232,Wyniosle_lol_zaborcow__czyli_Polandball.html|title=Wyniosłe lol zaborców, czyli Polandball|last=Orliński|first=Wojciech|authorlink=Wojciech Orliński|date=16 January 2010|publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|language=Polish|accessdate=25 March 2012}} < /ref > < ref name= " cooltura " > {{cite news|url=http://www.elondyn.co.uk/newsy,wpis,7731|title=Znowu lecą z nami w... kulki|last=Zapałowski|first=Radosław|date=15 February 2010|publisher=[[Cooltura]]|language=Polish|accessdate=22 March 2012|archive-date=14 May 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GcFM7m6D?url=http://www.elondyn.co.uk/newsy,wpis,7731|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Krautchan.net is a German-language [[imageboard]]. Its /int/ board is frequented by Russian-speaking [[netizen]]s. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to ''Falco''. Falco is a British user on /int/. In September 2009 Falco created the meme using [[MS Paint]]. The meme was made in an apolitical way to [[troll (internet)|troll]] ''Wojak''. Wojak is a Pole on the same board and contributes in [[wikt:broken English|broken English]]. Afterwards, Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by [[Russians]]. < ref name= " gazeta "  / > < ref name= " przeglad " > {{cite news|url=http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/fenomem|title=Fenomem - Polska nie umieć kosmos|last=Kapiszewski|first=Kuba|date=February 13, 2010|publisher=[[Przegląd]]|language=Polish|accessdate=26 March 2012|archive-date=5 August 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Rasv9f4k?url=http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/fenomem|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " KYM " > {{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/polandball|title=Polandball|publisher=[[Knowyourmeme]]|accessdate=26 March 2012}} < /ref >

 A description of Polandball is found on the [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] /r/Polandballball, which reads  " Wiggly mouse-drawn comics where balls represent different countries. They poke fun at national stereotypes and the  " international drama "  of their [[diplomatic]] relations. Polandball combines [[history]], [[geography]], Engrish, and an inferiority complex. The comic series first became popular on a well known [[Germany|German]] image board /int/. " 
 
 The premise of Polandball is it represents the [[history of Poland|history]], [[Foreign relations of Poland|relations with other countries]], and [[stereotype]]s. < ref name= " przeglad "  / > < ref name= " hiro " > {{cite news|url=http://hiro.pl/magazyn/magazyn_zjawiska/memy.html|title=MEMY.

This is similar to the [[Lolcat]] meme. Poland is purposely drawn as red on top of white. This is the opposite of the united nations flag.

 Some Polandball comics are based on the premise that Russia can fly into space. This premise also includes Poland cannot fly into space. One of the most popular Polandball cartoons begins with the premise that Earth is going to be struck by a giant meteor. All countries with [[space technology]] leave Earth and go into [[orbit]] around the planet. At the end of the cartoon, Poland is still on earth and is crying. In broken English, Poland says their famous catchphrase  " Poland cannot into space " . < ref name= " przeglad "  / >  In this [[Polish joke|humorous way]], Russians stop discussion with Poles on which country is superior. < ref name= " gazeta " / > < ref name= " przeglad "  / > < ref name= " hiro "  / >  Another Polandball comic delves into historic-political [[satire]]. Poland is seen to be boring other countryballs. Poland proclaims  " So when we crushed Russia and the turks [sic] were were the biggest country in the world... and.. " . This leads other countryballs to laugh at it. Poland, by now irritated, utters [[:wikt:kurwa|''kurwa'']]. Poland holds up a sign saying  " Internet serious business " . This is an internet slogan used to deride others who treat subjects with disdain. Then, in Polandball convention, Poland finishes by crying. < ref name= " gazeta "  / > < ref name= " cooltura "  / > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ROeMOIC|title=Polandball cartoon|publisher=Unknown|accessdate=26 March 2012|archive-date=9 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109234304/http://www.webcitation.org/66ROeMOIC|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
