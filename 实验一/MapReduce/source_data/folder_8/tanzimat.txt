 The '''Tanzimat''' was a period of reform in the [[Ottoman Empire]] that began in 1839 and ended in 1876. It intended to modernise the Ottoman Empire, and allowed for religious freedom. The period started with the publishing of the Tanzimat edict which was written by Koca Mustafa Reşit Paşa with the order of Mahmud II. There are two scripts and a constitution that has been published: The Hatti Humayun and Hatti Serif.
