 '''KFUO''' ('''850''' [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a [[Christian]] [[radio station]] in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]]. It can be heard locally on the radio, and it also streams online. It is the longest-running Christian radio station in the United States. The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) owns and runs the station. It broadcasts talk programs about the Bible, theology, and society. It also plays Lutheran sacred music. The station broadcasts four Lutheran church services on the weekends. < ref > {{cite web|title=Schedule and Program Guide|url=http://kfuo.org/programs/|publisher=KFUO Radion|access-date=August 4, 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 KFUO's studios are in the LCMS headquarters in [[Kirkwood, Missouri]]. The transmitter is located at [[Concordia Seminary]] in [[Clayton, Missouri|Clayton]]. 
 
 KFUO broadcasts on the same frequency as [[KOA (AM)]] in [[Denver]], Colorado. KOA is a [[clear-channel station]]. Because of this, KFUO must stop at night. The station's website plays sacred music when the 850 AM signal is off the air. 
 
 ==History== 
 On February 19, 1923, Richard Kretzschmar said that there should be a Lutheran radio station. This happened at a meeting of the Board of Control of [[Concordia Seminary]]. Then they raised money from students and other Lutheran organizations. < ref name= " KFUOHistory " > {{cite web|title=History|url=https://kfuo.org/about-us/mission/history/|publisher=KFUO Radio|access-date=August 5, 2018}} < /ref >  Then they started a  " radio committee "  to oversee the project. < ref name= " Cyclopedia " / > 
 
 Soon afterwards, construction for the station began at the seminary. At this time, it was located in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. The control room and studio for the station were located in the attic of one of the seminary buildings. < ref name= " Cyclopedia "  / >  The license to broadcast was issued on October 25, 1924. < ref name= " MediaHistory1 " > {{cite web|title=KFUO Was One Of St. Louis' First Stations|url=http://www.stlmediahistory.org/index.php/Radio/RadioArticles/kfuo-was-one-of-st.-louis-first-stations|publisher=St. Louis Media History Foundation|access-date=August 8, 2017|archive-date=August 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822221915/http://www.stlmediahistory.org/index.php/Radio/RadioArticles/kfuo-was-one-of-st.-louis-first-stations|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The station went on air for the first time the next day. It broadcast a speech about the laying of the cornerstone for the new seminary being constructed in Clayton. < ref name= " TIH10-26 " > {{cite web|title=Today in History October 26|url=http://www.lutheranhistory.org/history/tih1026.htm|publisher=Concordia Historical Institute|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-date=June 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624000147/http://www.lutheranhistory.org/history/tih1026.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The station was formally dedicated and began regular broadcasting on December 14, 1924. < ref name= " Cyclopedia " > {{cite web|work=Christian Cyclopedia|title=Radio Stations, Religious.|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=r & word=RADIOSTATIONS.RELIGIOUS|publisher=[[Concordia Publishing House]]|access-date=August 5, 2018}} < /ref >  In 1927, the station moved to the new campus of Concordia Seminary in Clayton. < ref name= " KFUOHistory " / > 
 
 At first, KFUO had to share frequences with other stations. < ref name= " KFUOHistory " / > < ref name= " MediaHistory1 " / >  The FCC approved the station to move to 830 & nbsp;kHz on July 1, 1940. By September 1941, the FCC reassigned the station to 850 & nbsp;kHz, where it has remained to this day. < ref name= " KFUOHistory " / > < ref name= " MediaHistory1 " / >  It also received a  " limited time "  license because this was the same frequency as KOA in Denver. KFUO can only operate between 80.5 and 102.5 hours per week. The exact hours depend on the times of sunrise and sunset in Denver. 
 
 The LCMS started the FM station KFUO-FM at 99.1 & nbsp;MHz in 1948. At first, the FM station broadcast the same thing as the AM station. In 1975, KFUO-FM switched to broadcasting classical music. < ref name= " KFUOHistory " / >  In March 2010 the FM station was sold to Gateway Creative Broadcasting. On July 7, 2010 of that year it switched to a [[Contemporary Christian]] format. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/st-louis-classic-99-ends-62-years-in-the-format-tonight-with-beethovens-9th|title=St. Louis'  " Classic 99 "  ends 62 years in the format tonight with Beethoven's 9th|date=July 6, 2010|work=Radio-Info.com|access-date=August 11, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322055914/http://www.radio-info.com/news/st-louis-classic-99-ends-62-years-in-the-format-tonight-with-beethovens-9th|archive-date=March 22, 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 In 1997, the FCC said that the LCMS's radio stations had violated the FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. The FCC said that KFUO and KFUO-FM did not hire enough minorities, women, and non-Lutherans. The LCMS lost an appeal within the FCC, and then appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. That court found, in [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod v. FCC]] (1998), that the FCC's requirements were unconstitutional. < ref > {{cite web|last=Carney|first=David|title=DC Appeals Court Rules Against FCC in Lutheran Church Case|url=http://www.techlawjournal.com/telecom/80415eeo.htm}} < /ref > 
 
 KFUO began streaming its broadcast on the station's web site, kfuo.org, in 1998. In 2004, KFUO started its [[HD radio]] station, the first in Missouri. < ref name= " KFUOHistory "  / > 
 
 In 2008, there was a controversy about the theological talk show, ''Issues, Etc.''. The program was removed from the station on March 18. The producer and host were also fired. Three weeks later, the management of KFUO announced that ''Issues, Etc.'' was canceled because the station did not have enough money for it. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=15079 |title=An updated statement on ''Issues, Etc.'' |publisher=[[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] |date=March 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526122539/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=15079 |archive-date=May 26, 2010}} < /ref >  The station did not make its financial information public. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ministrywatch.com/profile/jubilee-network.aspx |title=Jubilee Network/KFUO AM 850 |publisher=MinistryWatch.com |access-date=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429172750/http://ministrywatch.com/profile/jubilee-network.aspx |archive-date=April 29, 2010 }} < /ref >  About 75 people had a peaceful protest outside the LCMS International Center to question the station's motives. < ref name= " petition " > {{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/pages/rpage.asp?NavID=13570 |title='Issues, Etc.' cancellation draws responses |date=June 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124104748/http://www.lcms.org/pages/rpage.asp?NavID=13570 |work=Reporter |publisher=[[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] |archive-date=November 24, 2010}} < /ref > < ref name= " stlpd " > {{cite news |url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/religion/story/2AA6C162EE5AE3EA8625742C001087AA?OpenDocument |title=Missouri-Synod Lutherans protest cancellation of radio show |date=April 11, 2008 |work=[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080418201651/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/religion/story/2AA6C162EE5AE3EA8625742C001087AA?OpenDocument |archive-date=April 18, 2008}} < /ref >  More than 7,000 people signed a petition online to ask for the program to be returned. < ref name= " petition " / > < ref name= " petition " / >  The program started again on another local Christian radio station on June 30, 2008.
