 The '''aubergine''' (also called '''eggplant''' or brinjal) is a [[plant]]. It is actually a [[fruit]], but it is used like a [[vegetable]]. The plant is in the [[nightshade]] family of plants. It is related to the [[potato]] and [[tomato]]. Originally, it comes from [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The Latin/French term aubergine comes from the historical city of Vergina (Βεργίνα) in Greece. The aubergine [[eggplant]] is estimated to have been brought to Greece around 325 BC after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. Discovering this new vegetable during his conquest, Alexander the Great wanted to bring it back to his country on his return. After his death, members of his army brought aubergine seeds with them to Greece and specifically to the city of Vergina (Βεργίνα). The Latin/French term aubergine  (au·ber·gine) (\ˈō-bər-ˌzhēn\) is estimated around 1505 AD and is coined to Franco-Catalan gastronomist Sergius Rosario Silvestri, co-traveller and close friend to [[Amerigo Vespucci]]. Upon arrival to the historical site of Vergina (Βεργινα) and wanting to try the local delicacies, Silvestri came across the plant of aubergine. Not knowing its name, he referred to it as aubergine  (au Bergine or au Vergine) which in French means ''at Vergina'' or ''found at Vergina''.
