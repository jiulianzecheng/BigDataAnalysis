 '''''Dracovenator'''''  was a genus of [[theropod]] dinosaur that lived in southern [[Africa]] during the [[Lower Jurassic]] period. That was about 185 million years ago. It is closely related to ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''. It might have had a pair of crests like ''Dilophosaurus''. 
 
 Its name means  " Dragon hunter " . It was given this name because dinosaurs are similar to the dragons of mythology, and it was a carnivore, so it was probably a hunter.  
 
 ''Dracovenator'' was a large carnivore, about 23 feet long. It is the first large meat-eating dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic of Africa to be discovered. ''Dracovenator'' was described and named in 2006, based on a hand claw, an upper jaw with teeth, [[vertebra|back bones]], [[pelvis|hip bones]], ribs, and foot bones. There is one named species, ''Dracovenator regenti''. ''Dracovenator'' was discovered in the upper [[Elliot Formation]] in [[South Africa]].
