 '''Sugababes''' are a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[girl group]]. They were formed in 1998 by Ron Tom when the members were still at school. The band has since had a string of hits both in the [[United Kingdom]] including six number ones, and in several other countries. The band has changed its line-up thrice, because of reported differences between the members of the band. The original lineup was Siobhan, Mutya, and Keisha.
