'''Historiography''' is about the writing of [[history]] and the use of [[historical method]]s. Thus it looks at [[author]]s, [[source]]s, [[interpretation]], [[style]], [[bias]], and [[audience]]. It is sometimes called  " the history of history " . The word historiography can also refer to a body of historical work. 
 
 ==The history of written history== 
 For thousands of years people have been telling [[story|stories]] about the past, and making written records of the actions of [[king]]s and [[prophet]]s and other famous persons. After 500 BC, they began writing more organized histories. 
 
 === Hellenic world ===

 Written history appeared first with the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], whose historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The very first historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484 BC–ca.425 BC), who became later known as the 'father of history' ([[Cicero]]).   
 [[Thucydides]] was the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, and his successor [[Xenophon]] (ca. 431–355 BC) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his Anabasis. 
 
 === Roman world === 
 The Romans adopted the Greek tradition, becoming the first people to write history in a non-Greek language. The most famous writers are [[Julius Caesar]]'s (100 BC–44 BC) ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Bellum Gallicum]]''. 
 Livy (59 BC–AD 17) who records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from city-state to world dominion. < ref > [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html Livy's History of Rome: Book 9] < /ref > 
 [[Plutarch]] (c. 46 - 127) and [[Suetonius]] (c. 69-after 130) introduced [[biography]] as a branch of history. [[Tacitus]] (c. 56–c. 117) criticizes Roman [[immorality]] by praising [[Germanic peoples|German]] virtues. 
 
 ===Medieval Europe===

 Writing history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the [[Middle Ages]].  They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, the Church and of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers.  In the Early Middles Ages historical writing often took the form of [[annals]] or chronicles recording events year by year but this style tended to hampered the analysis of events and causes. < ref > Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder  &  Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, p. 78-79. < /ref >   An example of this type of writing are [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s which were the work of several different writers and start during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] in the late [[9th century]] and one copy of which was still being updated in 1154. 
 
 History was written about states or nations during the [[Renaissance]]. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that were important according to him, instead of describing events in a chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia''). 
 
 === Modern era === 
 Modern historiography began with Leopold Ranke in the 19th century, who was very critical on the sources used in history.  
 The French Annales School radically changed history during the 20th century. Fernand Braudel wanted history to become more scientific by demanding more mathematical evidence in history, in order to make the history discipline less subjective. Furthermore, he added a social-economic and geographic framework to answer historical questions. Other French historians, like Philippe Ariès and [[Michel Foucault]] described history of daily life topics such as death and sexuality. They wanted history to be written about all topics and that all questions should be asked. 
 
 ==== Historical journals ==== 
 Historical journals for academic historians to exchange ideas started in the nineteenth century.  The early journals were similar to the [[academic journal]]s used in the physical sciences, and were seen as a means by which history could be [[professional]]ised.  Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was ''Annales. Économies. Sociétés. Civilisations.'' a publication instrumental in establishing the [[Annales School]].

 ==Approaches to history == 
 The question of how a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important questions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach. 
 
 Some of the more common historigraphical approaches are: 
 
 *[[Annales School]] 
 *[[Deconstruction]] 
 *[[Oral history]] 
 
 ===Determinism=== 
 Determinism means that historians view history as being caused more by certain factors than by other factors.  The two most common types of determinism are geographic determinism and economic determinism.  Geographic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by [[geography]].  Frederick Jackson Turner was a proponent of geographic determinism.  Economic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by [[economics]].  Charles Beard was a proponent of economic determinism.  Other historians believe that history is caused mostly by [[politics]] or mostly by a struggle for [[natural rights]], but these are usually not labeled as determinism.
