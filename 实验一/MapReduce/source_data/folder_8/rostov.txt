 '''Rostov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росто́в; [[Old Norse]]: Rostofa) is one of the oldest towns in [[Russia]]. It was first mentioned in the year [[862]] as an already important town. By the [[13th century]] Rostov became the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of an important area. 
 
 Now it is an important tourist centre of the so-called [[Golden Ring of Russia|Golden Ring]]. It is located on the shores of [[Lake Nero]] in [[Yaroslavl Oblast]]. About 35,300 people lived there in 2002. 
 
 While the official name of the town is Rostov, it is better known to Russians as '''Rostov Veliky''', i.e. ''Rostov the Great''. This name is used to distinguish it from [[Rostov on Don]], which is now a much larger city. '''Rostov Yaroslavsky''' is the official name of its railway station (due to its position in Yaroslavl Oblast), but not of the town itself.
