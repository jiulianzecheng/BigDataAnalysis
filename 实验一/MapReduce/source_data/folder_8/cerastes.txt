 '''Cerastes''' is a [[genus]] of small [[Venom (poison)|venomous]] [[viper]]s growing up to the length of around 50 & nbsp;cm. There are currently three species found. They are usually known as the  " ''Horned Vipers'' " , the  " ''North African Desert Vipers'' " , or the  " ''Cerastes Vipers'' " . 
 
 == Behavior== 
 The Horned Viper is [[nocturnal]] and terrestrial (lives on the ground), and is usually found buried underneath the sand. They are said to be slow moving, but they are able to do sidewinding. When they do sidewinding they can move faster across the sand. They are able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. They sink into the sand tail first and keep on sinking deeper into the sand until only their eyes and nose are sticking out of the sand. The reason they do this is so they can ambush prey which come close to it. They are [[oviparous]], meaning they lay eggs. They live in the [[desert]]s of [[North Africa]], [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], and [[Iran]]. 
 
 === Feeding=== 
 The Horned Viper catch their prey by ambushing. They eat mainly [[rodent]]s, [[bird]]s and [[lizard]]s.
