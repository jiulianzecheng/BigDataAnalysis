Their place of residence was the subject of much dispute: according to both [[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]], these warrior women lived on the banks of the river [[Terme River|Thermodon]], by the [[Black Sea]], < ref name= " Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene " > [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene] < /ref > < ref name= " THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND " > [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND] < /ref >  while [[Diodorus]] states that, prior to the ones by the Black Sea, there lived a different tribe of Amazons in the region of Libya. < ref > [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html|Diodorus Siculus' ''Bibliotheca Historica'' (''Book III'', Ch. 52)] < /ref >  The Amazons were said to have founded several cities and temples found in Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons were the ones who invented the [[cavalry]]. < ref name= " Wonder Woman " > {{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}} < /ref >
