 The '''Laurales''' are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s. They are a basal group of [[dicot]]s. They are related to, and sometimes included in, the [[Magnoliales]]. 
 
 The order includes 85-90 [[genera]] from seven [[family (biology)|families]] of [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s. Most of the species are [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]], though a few genera reach the [[temperate zone]]. The best known species in this order are those of the [[Lauraceae]] (for example [[bay laurel]] or ''Laurus'', [[cinnamon]] or ''Cinnamomum'', [[avocado]] or ''Persea'', and ''[[Sassafras]]''), and the spice bush or ''[[Calycanthus]]'' of the Calycanthaceae. 
 
 The earliest lauraceous [[fossil]]s are from the [[Cretaceous]]. < ref > [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/ Stevens P.F. 2001 to date.

Indeed, at present no one [[trait]] is known which would unify all the members of Laurales. This used to cause much argument among botanists about the correct limits of the order. The presently classification is based on recent [[molecular biology|molecular]] and [[genetic analysis]].
