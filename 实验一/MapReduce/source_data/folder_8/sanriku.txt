 ==History== 
 In 1869, the provinces of [[Mutsu Province|Mutsu]] and [[Dewa Province|Dewa]] were divided.  
 
 Mutsu was split into new five provinces: [[Mutsu Province (1868)|Rikuōku]], < ref > Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005).

 The new provinces were abolished in July 1871; however, the regional name is still in use as the [[Sanriku Coast]] from Aomori to the [[Oshika Peninsula]] in Miyagi. < ref > Japan-i, [http://www.japan-i.jp/explorejapan/tohoku/iwate/sanrikucoast-north/d8jk7l000002r62g.html  Sanriku Coastline/Kamaishi Daikannon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722111046/http://www.japan-i.jp/explorejapan/tohoku/iwate/sanrikucoast-north/d8jk7l000002r62g.html |date=2011-07-22 }}; retrieved 2012-1-12. < /ref >
