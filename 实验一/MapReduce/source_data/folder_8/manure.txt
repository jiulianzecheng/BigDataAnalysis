 '''Manure''' is [[organic matter]] used as [[fertilizer]] in [[agriculture]]. Manures improve the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and lots of [[nutrient]]s, such as [[nitrogen]] that is trapped by [[bacterium|bacteria]] in the soil. Higher organisms then feed on the [[fungus|fungi]] and bacteria in a chain of life. 
 
 The term  " manure "  was used for inorganic [[fertilizer]]s in the past, but this usage is now very rare. < ref > [[Ronald Fisher]] seems to have used the word manure systematically for what we would call fertilizer today. < /ref >   Manure from birds and bats is called [[guano]]. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The word '''manure''' came from [[Middle English]]  " manuren "  meaning  " to cultivate land, "  and initially from [[French language|French]]  " main-oeuvre "  =  " hand work "  alluding to the work which involved manuring land.

 There are two classes of manures in [[soil]] management: [[green manure]]s and animal manures. [[Compost]] is distinguished from manure in that it is the ''decomposed'' remnants of organic materials (which may, nevertheless, include manure). 
 
 Most animal manure is [[feces]]–[[excrement]] of plant-eating [[mammal]]s ([[herbivores]]) and plant material (often straw) which has been used as bedding for animals and thus is heavily contaminated with their feces and [[urine]]. 
 
 [[Green manure]]s are crops grown for the express purpose of [[plow]]ing them under. In so doing, fertility is increased through the nutrients and organic matter that are returned to the soil.

 == Uses of manure == 
 
 Manure has been used for centuries as a [[fertilizer]] for [[farming]], as it is rich in [[nitrogen]] and other nutrients which facilitate the growth of plants.  Liquid manure from pig/hog operations is usually knifed (injected) directly into soil to reduce the unpleasant odors. Manure from hogs and cattle is spread on fields using a manure spreader. Due to the relatively lower level of proteins in grasses, which [[herbivores]] eat, cattle manure has a milder smell than the dung of carnivores–for example, elephant dung is practically odorless. However, due to the quantity of manure applied to fields, odor can be a problem in some agricultural regions.  Poultry droppings are harmful to plants when fresh but after a period of [[compost]]ing are valuable fertilizers.

 The [[cow dung|dried manure]] of animals has been used as [[fuel]] throughout history. Dried manure (usually known as dung) of [[cow]]s was, and still is, an important fuel source in countries such as [[India]], while [[camel]] dung may be used in treeless regions such as deserts. On the Oregon Trail, pioneering families collected large quantities of  " buffalo chips "  in lieu of scarce firewood. It has been used for many purposes, in cooking fires and to combat the cold [[desert]] nights. 
 
 Another use of manure is to make paper. This has been done with dung from [[elephant]]s where it is a small industry in Africa and Asia, and also [[horse]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[kangaroo]]s. Other than the llama, these animals are not [[ruminant]]s and thus tend to pass plant fibres undigested in their dung.
