 '''''Banksia''''' is a [[genus]] of plants common to [[Australia]], they were named after [[Joseph Banks]]. The ''Banksia'' are noted for their unique flowering. 
 
 It is a genus of around 170 [[species]] in the [[plant]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Proteaceae]]. < ref > George A.S. 1981. The genus Banksia. ''Nuytsia'' '''3''' (3): 239–473. < /ref >  As Australian wildflowers and popular [[garden]] [[plant]]s, they  are easily recognised by their characteristic flower spikes and fruiting  " cones " . They can vary from woody [[shrub]]s to trees up to 30 metres tall. They are generally found in a wide variety of landscapes: (occasionally) [[rainforest]], [[shrubland]], and some more [[arid]] landscapes, though not in Australia's [[deserts]]. 
 
 They produce plenty of [[nectar]],and are a vital part of the [[food chain]] in the Australian [[bush]]. They are an important food source for all sorts of nectariferous animals, including birds, bats, rats, [[possums]] and a host of invertebrates. Also, they are of economic importance to Australia's [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] and cut flower industries. 
 
 ''Banksia'' plants are threatened by land clearing, frequent burning and disease, and a number of species are [[rare]] and [[endangered species|endangered]].
