 The word  " corbel "  comes from [[Old French]] and derives from the [[Latin]] ''corbellus'', a [[diminutive]] of ''corvus'' (a [[raven]]) which refers to the beak-like appearance. < ref name= " Britannica11 " / > < ref > Oxford English Dictionary gives a similar etymology but from Latin corvellum or corvellus < /ref >  Similarly, the French refer to a bracket-corbel, usually a load-bearing internal feature, as a ''corbeau'' (a [[crow]]).
