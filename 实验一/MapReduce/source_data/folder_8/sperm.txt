 '''Sperm''' are the [[male]] [[reproduction|reproductive]] [[cell]]s. Most [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s use sperm to reproduce. They have different ways of making and releasing the sperm. In all cases the sperm meets with the [[ovum|egg]] of the [[female]] and together they grow into a new organism. 
 
 The name sperm is taken from the [[Greece|Greek]] word ''sperma'' meaning ''seed''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sperm|title=Etymology of Sperm}} < /ref > 
 
 An animal sperm cell is capable of movement, as it has to get to the [[uterus]] to meet with the [[ovum]]. Animal sperm cells (including humans) have small 'head' and a long tail called a ''[[flagellum]]''. The flagellum acts like a [[motor]] to propel the sperm cell through the female [[reproductive system]].  
 
 == In humans == 
 [[Human]] sperm is made in the [[testicle]]s of a [[man]]. Human sperm contains 23 [[chromosome]]s. A human needs 46 chromosomes, so a sperm cell is called a ''haploid'' as it only has half. The other half is contained within the [[ovum]] or egg of a female. During [[sexual intercourse|sex]], [[semen]] is shot out of the man's [[penis]] during [[ejaculation]]. 
 Semen carries the sperm into the woman's [[vagina]] and down to the ovum in the [[uterus]]. During ejaculation millions of sperm cells are released in the semen, but only one hundred or so reach the egg. < ref name=analysis > {{cite web|url=http://www.questdiagnostics.com/kbase/topic/medtest/hw5612/results.htm|title=SemenAnalysis Male Fertility Test, Sperm Count|access-date=2008-08-30|archive-date=2008-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828040822/http://www.questdiagnostics.com/kbase/topic/medtest/hw5612/results.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 The egg can merge with one sperm cell that reaches it.  Because it now has 46 chromosomes, it is called a ''diploid'', like ordinary cells of the body. This diploid is called a [[zygote]], and it can grow into a [[fetus]] and eventually a [[baby]]. 
 
 == In plants == 
 [[File:Plant sperm.png|thumb|right|The lower plants and the [[algae]] have different kinds of sperm]] 
 Some plants such as ferns and mosses have sperm that move. [[Flowering plant]] sperm [[cell]]s cannot move by themselves. The flowering plant sperm cells are contained within [[pollen]] grains. 
 Thus, they rely on ''transportation'' to take their sperm cells to other plants. For example, a [[bee]] lands on a plant to collect the [[nectar]]. Some pollen will get stuck to the bee. The bee moves on to another plant and the pollen falls onto that plant. The sperm is moved down a ''pollen tube'' until it reaches the [[ovule]] at the bottom of the flower.
