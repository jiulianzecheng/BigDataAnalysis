 An '''aquanaut''' is a person who stays at the bottom of the [[ocean]] for 24 hours or longer while exposed to the [[pressure]] of the water at that depth in the ocean. This usually happens in a special building, called an [[underwater habitat]], on the ocean bottom. 
 
 The first person to stay at the bottom of the ocean for 24 hours was a man from [[France]]. His name was [[Robert St√©nuit]]. This happened in September 1962. The [[United States Navy]] had a program in the 1960s called [[SEALAB]] in which [[military]] aquanauts and scientists spent time on the ocean bottom. This program ended in February 1969 after aquanaut [[Berry L. Cannon]] died from breathing too much [[carbon dioxide]]. 
 
 [[NASA]] carries out programs in the [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]] underwater habitat off [[Key Largo]] in [[Florida]]. These programs are called  " NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations "  ([[NEEMO]]). The NEEMO programs help teach [[astronaut]]s how to live and work in [[outer space]].
