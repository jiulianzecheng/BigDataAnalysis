 ==Introduction== 
 Clines consist of forms of a species that show gradual [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] and/or genetic differences over a geographical area.  
 
 The reason for these differences is that the [[environment]] is somewhat different in different parts of the range. Populations become adapted to the situation in their areas, but this [[adaptation]] is limited by gene flow between neighbouring sub-species. 
   
 Genetically, clines result from the change of [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]] within the [[gene pool]] of the species in question. < ref > Microsoft Encarta Premium 2009:  " cline " < /ref > < ref > King, Stansfield, Mulligan 2006.
