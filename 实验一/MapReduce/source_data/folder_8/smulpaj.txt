 '''Smulpaj''' (crumb pie) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[dessert]]. Unlike normal pies, the pie dish is greased first. A crumbly dough made of [[butter]], [[sugar]], [[wheat flour]] and [[oatmeal]] and placed on top is used instead of a [[pastry]] shell. < ref name= " Nordstrรถm 2013 p. 532 " > {{cite book | last=Nordström | first=T. | title=Tina Nordström's Scandinavian Cooking | publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-62914-010-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgeAwAAQBAJ & pg=PA532 | page=532}} < /ref >
