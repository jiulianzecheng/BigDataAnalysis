 '''Symbiosis''' (pl. symbioses) means living together. It describes close and long-term relationships between different [[species]]. The term was 
 used by [[Anton de Bary]] in 1879, as  " the living together of unlike organisms " . < ref > de Bary, Anton 1879. Die Erscheinung der Symbiosis. In ''Verlag auf der Versammlung der Naturforscher und Artze zu Cassel''. Strassburg. < /ref > < ref > Schwendener, Simon 1868. Unter suchungen über den Flechtenthallus. ''Beiträge zur wissenschaftlichten Botanik'' '''6''', 195–207. < /ref > < ref > Crombie J.M. 1886. On the algae-lichen hypothesis. ''J Linn. Soc''. '''21''', 259–282. < /ref >   
 
 A '''symbiont''' is an organism living in a relationship with another species in which one or both get benefits. < ref name= " King " > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. < /ref >  When one species lives inside another species, or a [[microscope|microscopic]] symbiont lives inside the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of a host, it is called an [[endosymbiont]]. 
 
 The relevance of symbiosis is its frequency and its [[evolution]]ary significance. There appear to be no higher plants or animals without symbionts. Those symbionts are of great importance to the larger organisms, who in most cases would be unable to live as they do without their symbionts. [[Mycorrhiza]] in higher plants, and [[gut flora]] in [[insects]] and [[vertebrate]]s are examples. Humans are no exception. < ref name=Guarner > {{cite journal |author=Guarner F, Malagelada JR |title=Gut flora in health and disease |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9356 |pages=512–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12583961 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12489-0 |s2cid=38767655 |url=}} < /ref > < ref name=Sears > {{cite journal |author=Sears CL |title=A dynamic partnership: celebrating our gut flora |journal=Anaerobe |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=247–51 |year=2005  |pmid=16701579 |doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2005.05.001 |url=}} < /ref > 
 
 Furthermore, most of these associations are between organisms not just from different species, but from different [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. And lastly, the cells of all [[eukaryote]]s contain [[organelle]]s which are descendants of symbiotic relationships which began at least a [[billion]] years ago. [[Mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s are examples. The conclusion must be that symbiosis has been highly significant in the evolution of life.

 The definition of symbiosis has been controversial. Some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent [[mutualism]]s, while others believe it should apply to all kinds of long-term biological interactions. < ref > {{Citation |title= The symbiotic habit|last= Douglas|first= Angela E.|year= 2010|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= New Jersey|isbn= 978-0-691-11341-8|pages= 5–12}} < /ref > 
 
 After 130 years of debate, < ref > {{Citation |title= Symbiosis: 'Living together' in chaos|last1= Martin|first1= Bradford D.|last2= Schwab|first2= Ernest|year= 2012|journal= Studies in the History of Biology|volume= 4|issue= 4|pages= 7–25}} < /ref >  current [[biology]] and [[ecology]] textbooks now use the latter  " de Bary "  definition or an even broader definition (where symbiosis means all species interactions). The restrictive definition (where symbiosis means mutualism only) is no longer used. < ref > {{Citation |title= Current usage of symbiosis and associated terminology|last1= Martin|first1= Bradford D.|last2= Schwab|first2= Ernest|year= 2013|journal= International Journal of Biology|volume= 5|issue= 1|pages= 32–45|doi=10.5539/ijb.v5n1p32}} < /ref > 
 
 The widest definition includes [[parasitism]] (in which one [[organism]] is helped and the other [[organism]] is hurt), [[mutualism]] (in which both [[organisms]] are helped), [[commensalism]] (in which one [[organism]] is helped and the other is not affected), and [[competition]] (in which both [[organisms]] are hurt). 
 
 == Types of symbiosis == 
 
 [[File:symbiotic relationships.svg|thumb|Three types of symbiotic relationships: commensalist (I), parasitic (II), and mutualist (III)]] 
 
 The various forms of symbiosis include: 
 === Type 1: Partners keep their bodies separate === 
 Symbiosis does not always benefit both partners. This is what may happen: 
 
 * [[parasitism]], in which the association has disadvantages for one of the two. One may even destroy or kill the other. (+ –) 
 * [[mutualism]], in which the association has advantages for both (+ +) 
 * [[commensalism]], in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected (+ 0) 
 * [[competition]], in which both members of the association are fighting over food or other needs. (– –) 
 
 === Type 2: Partners live as one organism ===

 This kind of symbiosis is called [[endosymbiosis]]. Examples are: 
 *[[Rhizobia]]: [[nitrogen]]-fixing [[bacteria]] which live in [[root]] nodules on plants of the [[pea]] family. 
 *Singly-celled [[foram]]s which include a single-celled [[alga]] inside the cell. This is 'facultative', which means they may or may not do it. A more far-reaching version is ''idioplastic'' endosymbiosis. Here, the foram consumes the alga, but keeps its [[chloroplast]]s in working order. 
 *[[Green algae]] inside [[Ocean|marine]] [[polychaete]] worms. 
 *Single-celled algae inside [[reef]]-building [[coral]]s. 
 *[[Bacteria]] inside the guts of those [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s which digest plant [[cellulose]]. These are 'obligate' symbionts, which means the host must have them. < ref > Buchner P. 1965. ''Endosymbioses of animals with plant microorganisms''. Wiley N.Y. < /ref > 
 *[[Lichen]]: [[fungus]]+[[alga]] or [[bacterium]]. 
 *[[Mycorrhiza]]: fungal [[hypha]]e and [[root]]s of [[tree]]s. 
 Almost for certain, this happened to form the [[eukaryote]] [[cell]]. That's the type of cell all animals and plants are made of. The [[organelle]]s inside the cell, such as [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, contain some DNA. This DNA is the remnant of a once separate [[bacterium]]. The theory is that the eukaryote cell evolved by the fusion of several bacteria or [[archaea]] organisms. < ref > Margulis, Lynn 1998. ''The symbiotic planet: a new look at evolution''.

 == Examples of symbiosis == 
 * An example of mutual symbiosis is the relationship between [[clownfish]] that live among the [[tentacle]]s of tropical [[sea anemone]]s. The clownfish protects the anemone from other [[fish]].  Clownfish waste excreted provides vital nutrients, and they can boost their hosts’ oxygen supplies at night too.  The stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the anemone fish from its [[predator]]s. A special [[mucus]] on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles. < ref > [https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21572738-clownfish-help-their-anemones-breathe-finding-nemos-role ''Clownfish help their anemones breathe''] March 2, 2013 [[The Economist]] < /ref > 
 
 *Another example is the [[goby|goby fish]], which sometimes lives together with a [[shrimp]]. The shrimp digs and cleans up a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the goby live. The shrimp is almost blind, and is vulnerable to predators when above ground. When a predator approaches, the goby touches the shrimp with its tail as a signal. When that happens both the shrimp and goby quickly retreat into the burrow. 
 
 * A [[lichen]] is an intimate combination of a [[fungus]] with an [[alga]]. The alga lives inside the fungus, which must have the alga to survive. The alga, on the other hand, can survive on its own. The result of the union is a flat, coloured lichen which grows on rocks and other surfaces in the open air. 
 
 * [[Herbivores]] are host to [[gut]] [[bacteria]] which help them digest plant material. Plant cell walls are made of [[cellulose]], and almost no animal has developed an enzyme to digest this material. Therefore, at least for herbivores which eat leaves, the bacteria are essential. 
 
 * Some species of [[ants]] 'farm' [[aphid]]s, protecting them from predators, and moving them from one feeding site to another. The ants consume the sweet sticky fluid which aphids secrete after sucking plant [[sap]].
