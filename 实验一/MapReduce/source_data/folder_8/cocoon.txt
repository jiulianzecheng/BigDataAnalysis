 A '''cocoon''' is a [[shell]] made of [[silk]] by most kinds of [[moth]] [[caterpillar]]s and other [[insect]] [[larva]]e. Some [[butterfly]] [[larva]]e (in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Hesperiidae]] and [[subfamilies]] [[Parnassiinae]] and [[Satyrinae]]) do spin cocoons. < ref name= " Smart " > {{cite book|last=Smart|first=Paul|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Butterfly World|publisher=Chartwell Books Inc|date=1977|pages=33|chapter=2|isbn=0-89009-093-9}} < /ref >  However, most butterfly [[pupa]]e are called [[chrysalis|chrysalids]]. < ref name= " Smart " / >  Some caterpillars attach small twigs or pieces of vegetation to the outside of their cocoon to hide it from [[predator]]s. Others spin their cocoon in a hidden place. Examples would be on the underside of a leaf, in a crevice, or down near the base of a tree trunk. 
 
 Silkworm cocoons are processed and used to produce natural [[silk]] for [[clothing]].
