[[File:Octagon_2.svg|thumb|An octagon]] 
 An '''octagon''' or '''8-gon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 8 sides and 8 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular octagon == 
 All sides of a '''regular octagon''' are the same length. Each corner is 135°. All corners added together equal 1080°. 
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular octagon takes up is 
 
 : < math > \text{Area} = 2(1+\sqrt{2})a^2. < /math > 
 
 ''a'' is the length of one of its sides. 
 
 Another way to write it is 
 
 : < math > \text{Area} = 2 a^2 (\sqrt{2} + 1). < /math >
