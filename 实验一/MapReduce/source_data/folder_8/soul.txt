 Many [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religion]]s say that a '''soul''' is the part of a [[life|living]] [[human being]] which is [[supernatural]] and lives after [[human death|death]]. It is usually said to be [[immortal]]. It cannot be discovered by science, because it cannot be tested in any controlled way. Many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal [[experience]] after death.  
 
 [[Reincarnation]] is a belief that after the body dies, the soul will be born again in another body. It is important to [[Hinduism]]. [[Buddhist]]s understand the idea of an eternal soul, and the idea of simple annihilation as delusion; they say that there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul or essence in phenomena.  Buddhists believe in [[transmigration]], or [[rebirth]] in samsara or other [[planes of existence]], based on how they understand kamma (PƒÅli; karma in Sanskrit), and nibbana (nirvana in Sanskrit) for Enlightened ones. 
 
 [[Resurrection]] is the Christian belief that a soul returns in the same body. In most Christian denomination this was realized in Jesus Christ but is also the promise for all souls; see [[heaven]], [[hell]], and [[Final Judgement]]. 
 
 Most [[Atheism|atheists]] say that there is no such thing as a soul, and that the body is the only part of a person. 
 
 == Popular culture == 
 In popular culture, soul usually means deep feeling and commitment. It is in this sense that the word appears in the term [[soul music]]. However that music was also influenced by [[gospel music]] which was religious. 
 
 One popular idea about souls that is easy to express, is that a person ''is'' a soul, and ''has'' a body. < ref > Miller, Walter M. Jr. (1960). ''A Canticle for Leibowitz.'' < /ref >  The soul is the  " I "  in  " I exist "  that feels and lives life. What people call the [[mind]] could be ''part'' of the soul: one soul started this article, other souls have edited it, and another soul is reading it. This view, however, implies that the [[human body]] is a possession, and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker (some people say that [[animal]]s, [[heretic]]s, and people of another [[religion]] do not have souls). Like most uses of the verb [[to be]], there is an ideology in these simple words. 
 
 Christianity teaches that all humans have an immortal soul. < ref name=mayled > {{cite book|title=GCSE Religious Studies: Philosophy and Applied Ethics for OCR B: Revision Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/gcsereligiousstu0000mayl_a2d6|first=Jon|last=Mayled|publisher=Hodder Education|date=2010|page=[https://archive.org/details/gcsereligiousstu0000mayl_a2d6/page/17 17]|isbn=978-1-444-11071-5}} < /ref >  This means that it is a part of them which does not die when their physical body dies, but lives on with them to [[heaven]] or to [[hell]]. Christians believe that the soul is the 'breath of life' which God gave to Adam. < ref name=mayled / > 
 
 In [[Japan]] the soul is believed to weigh 21 grams. This belief may have been influenced by the observations of [[:en:Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Dr. McDougall]] in the early 1900s.{{cn|date=June 2013}}  < !-- citation needed tag includes both sentences -- > 
 
 === Characteristics === 
 One distinction often made is between soul, which is distinct from other souls, and [[spirit]] which may be combined with that of other beings. The idea of the [[Holy Spirit]] in [[Christianity]], for example, is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of, and which is expressed on Earth in that faith by  " the Church "  meaning  " the body of Christ "  meaning  " all bodies that follow Jesus. "  This could be more inclusive than the is/has view of souls and bodies.
