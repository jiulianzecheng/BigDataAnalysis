 A '''watchtower''' or '''watch tower''' is a [[tower]] used for [[surveillance]]. They were used at city walls to see invaders, when they were far away, so the city could prepare for an attack. A watchtower is also used for watching over people (like a town or a city). Watchtowers were popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. They are still often used to watch over [[prisoner]]s and make sure that they don't escape or leave the area. [[Forestry]] uses watchtowers to find fires before they become more dangerous.
