 An '''ooid''' is a small rounded [[sedimentary rock]]. Like sand grains, ooids have a diameter of 2 mm or less. Larger grains formed the same way as ooids are called ''pisoids''. Rock made of ooids isÂ '''oolite'''. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ooid Sand - Sandatlas|url=http://www.sandatlas.org/ooid-sand/|access-date=2022-04-16|website=www.sandatlas.org}} < /ref >
