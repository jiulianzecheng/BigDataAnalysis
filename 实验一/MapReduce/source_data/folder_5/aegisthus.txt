'''Aegisthus''' (or ''Aigisthos'') was a figure in [[Greek mythology]]. He is known from two sources. The first is [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', about the end of the 8th century [[BC]]. The second from [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Oresteia]]'', written in the 5th century BC.  
 
 As [[Agamemnon]] lay siege to [[Troy]], his queen [[Clytemnestra]] took Aegisthus as a lover. The couple killed Agamemnon when he returned.  Aegisthus ruled for seven more years before being killed by Agamemnon's son ''[[Orestes]]''. This is part of the story of the ''Orestia''.
