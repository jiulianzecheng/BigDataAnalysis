'''Pedogenesis''' or '''soil evolution (formation)''' is how [[soil]] is created. 
 
 [[Climate]] regulates soil formation. Soils develop more in areas with more [[rainfall]] and more warmth. The rate of chemical [[weathering]] increases by 2-3 times when the temperature increases by 10 degrees Celsius (50Â°F). Climate also affects which organisms are present, affecting the soil chemically and physically (movement of roots, burrowing by animals). 
 
 The organisms living in and on the soil form distinct soil types. [[Coniferous]] forests have acidic leaf litter. Mixed or [[deciduous]] forests leave a larger layer of [[humus]]. [[Prairie]]s have very high humus accumulation, creating a dark, thick soil. 
 
 The rock from which soil is formed is called 'parent material' ([[bedrock]]). The main types are: [[eolian]] (wind), [[glacier|glacial material]], [[alluvium]], [[lake]] material other parent materials. 
 
 Pedogenesis is the major topic of the science of '''pedology'''. Its other aspects include the [[soil morphology]], [[soil classification|classification]] ([[taxonomy]]) of soils,  and their distribution in nature.
