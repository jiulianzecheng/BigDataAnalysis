 '''''Impatiens''''' is a [[genus]] of about 850 & ndash;1,000 [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s, widely distributed throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[tropics]]. < ref > ''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607 < /ref >  Together with  ''Hydrocera triflora'', they make up the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Balsaminaceae]]. < ref > Common names include '''impatiens''', '''jewelweeds''', '''[[touch-me-not]]s''', and, for ''I. walleriana'' in Great Britain,  " Busy Lizzie " , and '''balsams'''.  " Jewelweed "  is used only for [[Nearctic]] species,  " balsam "  is usually applied to tropical species, and  " touch-me-not "  is used in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|url=https://archive.org/details/azencyclopediaof0000unse|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1405332965|pages=1136}} < /ref >   
 
 These plants derives their scientific name ''Impatiens'' ([[Latin]] for  " impatient " ) and the common name  " touch-me-not "  in reference to their [[seed]] [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]]s. When the capsules mature, they 'explode' when touched, sending seeds several metres away. This mechanism is also known as  " explosive dehiscence " ; see also [[rapid plant movement]]. 
 
 Impatiens have become one of the most popular garden annuals. Hybrids, typically derived from  " Busy Lizzie "  (the well-known ''I. walleriana'') and the New Guinea Impatiens (''I. hawkeri''), have commercial importance as garden plants. ''I. walleriana'' is native to [[East Africa]], < ref > {{cite web|title=Impatiens|url=http://faculty.ucc.edu/biology-ombrello/POW/Impatiens.htm|access-date=2012-10-30|archive-date=2012-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031231920/http://faculty.ucc.edu/biology-ombrello/POW/Impatiens.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and was bred through selection by Claude Hope. The original series of impatiens bred by Hope was the 'Elfin' series of [[cultivar]]s, later improved as the 'Super Elfin' series. Double-flowered cultivars also exist. But in [[tropical]] islands, such as [[Hawaiʻi]], Busy Lizzie can also become a [[wikt:noxious|noxious]] [[weed]].
