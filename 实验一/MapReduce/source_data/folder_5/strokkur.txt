 == Tourism == 
 Strokkur is famous throughout Iceland and regularly attracts many tourists. People go there to see the geyser erupt. 
 
 == Sequence of the eruption == 
 The water present at a depth of 23 meters has a temperature of about 120 ° C, but cannot transform into a gaseous state due to the high pressure, due to the overlying mass of water. When this water reaches 16 meters deep, a certain amount can reach the boiling point and this induces the chain reaction that we see.
