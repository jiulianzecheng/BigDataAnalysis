 A '''ballerina''' is a name given to a [[female]] [[ballet]] dancer. Only very good female ballet dancers are called ballerinas. A ballerina is a principal dancer in a classical ballet company. The highest ranking female dancer in a company was usually called the '''prima ballerina'''. 
 
 Today the term 'ballerina' has gone rather out of fashion. Now they are simply called 'Principal dancers'. < ref > Crane, Debra and Mackrell, Judith 2000. ''The Oxford dictionary of dance''. Oxford University Press. p40 < /ref >  Dancers in a company are [[rank]]ed by the company, and paid accordingly. They have to prove themselves in lesser parts before they can get promoted.  
 
 Example of the ranks in a modern dance company: < ref > From the progamme of the [[Mariinsky Theatre|Mariinsky Ballet]] at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]], 2011. < /ref >
