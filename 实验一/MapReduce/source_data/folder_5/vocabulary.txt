 A '''vocabulary''' is a list of [[word]]s. 
 
 The [[vocabulary]] a person uses is all the words that person knows and uses. In general, a person who is five knows about 4,000 to 5,000 words. < ref > Nation, Paul, and Robert Waring. 1997. Vocabulary size, text coverage and word lists. ''Vocabulary: Description, acquisition and pedagogy'', 6-19. [http://www.fltr.ucl.ac.be/fltr/germ/etan/bibs/vocab/cup.html] < /ref >  [[Adult]]s who have gone to [[college]] may know 20,000 words. < ref > Goulden R; Nation P.  &  Read J. 1990. How large can a receptive vocabulary be? ''Applied Linguistics'' '''11''': 341-363. < /ref >  A hearing vocabulary and reading vocabulary are bigger than a speaking vocabulary or writing vocabulary, as people understand some words that they do not use. 
 
 The number of words in a [[language]] is more than the words listed in one dictionary. One dictionary may have a list of 500,000 (half a [[million]]) words. Another dictionary may have some other words that the other dictionary does not have. Adding up all the words in those dictionaries, there are about 750,000 words in [[English language|English]]. There may be more words than that. < ref name=Crystal > Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge University Press, p119, p423. < /ref > 
 
 The most used words are short words. That is true in all languages. < ref > Zipf G.K. 1949. ''Human behavior and the principle of least effort''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley. < /ref >  The 50 most common words in English have fewer than seven letters. Half of these words have fewer than four letters. < ref name=Crystal/ >   
 
 The vocabulary of a language is always changing.  New words are made or words change their meaning. Words about [[computer]]s, like  " download "  are new to the [[English language]]. The new word  " bling "  came from [[hip hop]].  Words like  " cool "  have developed new meanings.
