 On the first day, the girls gather at the middle of the town or village. Then they break up into groups, and walk through the town. They [[sing]] and [[dance]] for the people in every house, and also in the village square. The people in each house give them money, food, drinks, or other [[gift]]s. The women and girls give these gifts to poor people. They sing and dance all day until [[sunset]]. This festival may last for a week or more. 
 
 Ashenda is thousands of years old. It existed even before Ethiopia became [[Christianity|Christian]], in the [[4th century]] AD. < ref name= " AEMIH " > {{Cite web|date=26 August 2019|title=ASHENDA: Ethiopia’s Multihued Intangible Heritage|url=https://www.ena.et/en/?p=9315|website=ENA}} < /ref >  as the Tigrayans migrated down south they brought the culture to the southern part of Ethiopia it was adopted reflecting the spirit and culture of the locals developing new name E.g in Wello region it's called '''Shadey''', [[Agew Awi Zone]] they call is '''Ashendye''', in [[Gojjam]] and [[Shewa]] region they call it '''Solel''', or '''Mariya'''.

 == Story == 
 According to old stories, King [[Menelik I]] of Ethiopia was the son of the ancient [[Israelite]] king [[Solomon]]. He traveled to Ethiopia with other Israelites in the [[10th century BC]]. In modern times, [[Jews]] lived in Ethiopia: the [[Beta Israel]] people. Researcher Timkehet Teffera thinks that Ashenda started as an ancient Israelite celebration. < ref name= " TefferaII-I "  / >  Other people think that Ashenda was once a [[pagan]] festival. They think it started to celebrate the [[harvest]] season, or as a time for women and men to find partners for [[marriage]]. < ref name= " Balehey "  / > 
 
 Ethiopia became Christian in the 4th century AD. The meaning of Ashenda changed to focus on the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. It is mainly celebrated in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]. This church says that after Mary died, the [[Apostles]] [[fasting|fasted]] for 14 days. On the 15th day, they buried her. So Ethiopians fast for the first 15 days of ''Nahase'', a month in the [[Ethiopian calendar]]. On the 16th day, Mary rose from the [[grave]]. God carried her to [[Heaven]]. This event is called the [[Assumption of Mary]]. Ashenda starts on ''Nahase'' 16th, in honor of the Assumption. 
 
 The story says that Mary rose from a glowing field of tall grass. Some say that the ashenda grass represents this field. Others say that it is related to the story of [[Moses]]. When Moses was born, the [[Pharaoh|king of Egypt]] said to kill all baby Israelite boys. Moses' mother had to hide her son to save his life. She hid him in a basket in the grasses by a river. The king's daughter found Moses and raised him in [[secret]]. One popular Ashenda song is about Moses.

 Girls usually wear a white cotton dress. People weave these dresses by hand, without a machine. They put colorful embroidery patterns on the dresses. However, now some girls wear colorful cloths from other countries. Girls usually tie a band of cotton cloth around their waist. They often wear plastic shoes. The girls' hair is [[braid]]ed. A few days before the festival, girls go to local [[hairdresser]]s. They can braid hair in many complex ways. The girls wear many types of jewelry. It can be made of [[gold]], [[silver]], [[brass]], [[copper]], [[seashell]]s, [[coconut]] shells, [[bead]]s, or twisted [[Natural fibre|thread]]s. They often wear [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s, and ankle bracelets. < ref name= " TefferaII-I "  / >  They traditionally wear [[Kohl (cosmetics)|Kohl]] eyeliner on their face. Today, they also wear other kinds of makeup, or [[cosmetics]].

 Many families buy new clothing and jewelry for Ashenda. If the family does not have enough money to buy clothing, neighbors or relatives will [[:wikt:lend|lend]] it to them. Each group of girls plans what they will wear for Ashenda, so they can all wear the same style. < ref name= " TefferaII-I "  / > < ref name= " Nunoo " > {{Cite web|last=Nunoo|first=Ama|date=11 October 2019|title=The Ashenda festival of the Ethiopians where girls parade their beauty to get suitors|url=https://face2faceafrica.com/article/the-ashenda-festival-of-the-ethiopians-where-girls-parade-their-beauty-to-get-suitors|access-date=7 February 2023|website=Face2Face Africa|language=}} < /ref > 
 
 == Celebration == 
 Ashenda involves singing, dancing, and playing [[drum]]s. Older family members, especially [[mother]]s, teach Ashenda [[tradition]]s to the girls. Most Ashenda groups have at least one boy with them. Traditionally, boys walk with the girls to protect them. During Ashenda, girls meet many different people. So it can also be a time to find a [[husband]]. < ref name= " Nunoo "  / > < ref name= " TefferaII-II "  / > 
 
 On the first day of Ashenda, girls go to a [[church]] and pray. They then sing songs of praise to St. Mary. After this, they go to houses and sing and dance. The people in each house usually give them gifts. Some common gifts are chicken stew, honey wine, local beer, and money. Then the girls sing a special song to thank them. 
 
 Some Ashenda songs are about [[political]] topics. They may [[:wikt:criticize|criticize]] people in the village, or in the government. The girls are free to say anything they want in their songs. Tradition says that nobody can stop them from talking. Girls in Ethiopia do not usually have this freedom. So Ashenda is a special time for them. Ashenda songs may also say nice things about people in the town. Girls may sing about unity and belonging. They may sing about the [[:wikt:joy|joy]] of the celebration. < ref name= " Balehey "  / > 
 
 The songs are usually sung in two parts: the group leader, and everyone else. They are often sung as an [[Antiphon (music)|antiphon]], or call and response. The drum and [[clapping|hand claps]] keep a [[rhythm]]. < ref name= " TefferaIII-I " > {{Cite web|last=Teffera|first=Timkehet|date=2019|title=Ethiopian Magnificent Holidays: A Case Study of the Ašända Feast.
