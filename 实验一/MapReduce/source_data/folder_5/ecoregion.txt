 An '''ecoregion''' (ecological region), sometimes called a '''bioregion''', is the next smallest [[Ecology|ecologically]] and geographically defined area beneath  " realm "  or  " [[ecozone]] " . Ecoregions cover relatively large area of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct natural [[community (ecology)|communities]] and [[species]]. When defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), the boundaries of an ecoregion approximate the original extent of the natural communities prior to any major recent disruptions or changes. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] has identified 825 terrestrial ecoregions, and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth. 
 
 World Wide Fund for Nature's full definition of an ecoregion, which is widely accepted and used, is the following: 
 :''A large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities that 
 ::''(a) share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics;'' 
 ::''(b) share similar environmental conditions, and;'' 
 ::''(c) interact ecologically in ways that are critical for their long-term persistence.''

 The ''[[Global 200]]'' is the list of ecoregions identified by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) as priorities for [[conservation]]. 
 
 == Terrestrial == 
 A terrestrial ecoregion is a certain area of land which is different from the area near it. It has a distinct [[climate]], [[geology]], type of [[soil]], water availability, and distinct living [[species]] (the animals and plants that live in the ecoregion). 
 
 For example, one ecoregion can be a [[desert]]. It would have sand, very little water, very hot [[temperature]]s during the day and very cold at night. The [[plant]]s could be just bushes, small [[tree]]s, [[cactus|cactii]]. The [[animal]]s could be [[scorpion]]s, little [[mammal]]s, [[spider]]s. 
 
 Or for example, an ecoregion could be a [[tropical]] [[forest]] It would have warm temperatures all day, a lot of rainfall all year, a huge river crossing, and a very [[Organic matter|organic]] soil. The plants could be huge trees or ferns. The animals could be [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]] and [[ape]]s. 
 
 == Marine == 
 Marine ecoregions are regions of the world's [[ocean]]s, that are defined by the WWF, to help activities for saving [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[ecosystem]]s. 
 
 The scheme used to find out these ecoregions is more or less the same as that for terrestrial ecoregions. Major [[habitat]] types are identified: polar, temperate shelfs and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]], [[Pelagic zone|abyssal]], and [[Pelagic zone|hadal]] (ocean trench) â€” which correspond to the terrestrial [[biome]]s. Major biogeographic realms, analogous to the seven terrestrial [[ecozone]]s, represent large regions of the ocean basins: North Temperate [[Atlantic]], Eastern Tropical Atlantic, Western Tropical Atlantic, South Temperate Atlantic, North Temperate [[Pacific Ocean|Indo-Pacific]], Central Indo-Pacific, Eastern Indo-Pacific, Western Indo-Pacific, South Temperate Indo-Pacific, [[Southern Ocean]], [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic]], [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]], and [[Mediterranean]]. 
 
 The classification of Marine ecoregions is not developed to the same level of detail and comprehensiveness as that of the terrestrial ecoregions; only the priority conservation areas of the [[Global 200]] are listed. 
 
 See [[Global 200#Global 200 Marine ecoregions|Global 200 Marine ecoregions]] for a full list of marine ecoregions (World Wide Fund for Nature). 
 
 == Freshwater == 
 Freshwater ecoregions are the [[freshwater]] habitats of a particular geographic area, including [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[wetland]]s. Freshwater ecoregions are distinct from [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s, which have biotic communities of the land, and [[marine ecoregion]]s, which are biotic communities of the oceans. 
 
 The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] speaks of seven major habitat types of freshwater ecoregions: Large rivers, large river [[headwater]]s, large [[river delta]]s, small rivers, large lakes, small lakes, and xeric basins. 
 
 Several freshwater ecoregions are listed in the [[Global 200]], the WWF's priority ecoregions for conservation of [[biodiversity]].
