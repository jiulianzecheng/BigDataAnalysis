 The '''Taunus''' is a mountain range in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. It is bounded by the river valleys of [[Rhine]], [[Main]] and [[Lahn]]. On the opposite side of the Rhine, the mountains are continued by the [[Hunsrück]]. The mountains themselves span the districts of [[Hochtaunuskreis]], [[Main-Taunus]], [[Rheingau-Taunus]], and [[Rhein-Lahn]]. 
 
 Not to be confused with the more famous and high [[Feldberg]] in [[Black Forest]], the highest peak is the ''Großer Feldberg'' (878 [[metre|m]] above [[sea level]]). It is followed by the ''Kleiner Feldberg'' and the ''Altkönig'' (798 m) with the remains of a late [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]] (La-Tène A, ca. [[400 BC]]) near the summit. 
 
 The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Limes]] was built across the Taunus. The [[Saalburg]], a restored Roman castellum, now houses a museum. After the fall of the Limes (in [[259]]/[[260]] AD), the [[Alamanni]] settled here.
