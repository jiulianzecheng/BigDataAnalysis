 In an interview from 2007, Chris Thile described what he had in plan for ''Deceiver'': {{cquote| " I had to get that record out of my system I think. I really love pop music. I really love well made pop music. I needed to try making a pop record before I could move on and do what I really think I actually should be doing. That [last record] was like exploring pop music, not as an influence of mine, but as the desired result. Sometimes it works, but that ultimately I’m just not a pop musician. I love [pop music]; I think it’s a very noble calling. But it’s not my calling. And that’s kinda how I feel about that record. I feel like I hit the nail on the head about maybe two or three out of ten. Which is not a high enough percentage. That being said, I’m proud of that record because I think it helped me get that out of my system. I also like the control thing. I realized I don’t want that much control. That’s just too much control for any one musician to have. And it’s not necessarily conducive to the best music making.
