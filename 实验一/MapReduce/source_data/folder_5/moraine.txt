[[Image:Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Moraines on a side glacier of the [[Gorner Glacier]], [[Zermatt]], [[Switzerland]].  The '''lateral moraine''' is the high snow-free bank of debris in the top left hand quarter of the picture.  The '''medial moraine''' is the double line of debris running down the centre-line of the glacier.]]  
 '''Moraines''' are accumulations of [[debris]] that are found in [[region]]s where there are [[glacier]]s or were glaciers formerly. 
 
 Moraines which are found far off from existing glaciers were created during a past [[ice age]].  The debris may have been taken off the valley floor as a glacier moved or fallen off the valley walls as a result of [[weathering]].  Moraines may be made of [[silt]] like [[Rock flour|glacial flour]] to large [[boulder]]s. Moraines may be on the glacierâ€™s surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted.  Moraines may also develop when a glacier or [[iceberg]] reaches the sea and melts, dropping rocks that it has carried.
