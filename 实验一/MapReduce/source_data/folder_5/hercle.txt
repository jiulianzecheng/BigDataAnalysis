 '''Hercle''' (alternately spelled '''Heracle''' or '''Hercl''') is a hero and god in [[Etruscan mythology]]. The son of [[Tinia]] and [[Uni]], Hercle was the Etruscan equivalent of the Greek hero [[Herakles]], depicted as a muscular figure who carried a club and wore a lionskin. Hercle was a popular subject in [[Etruscan art]], especially [[bronze mirrors]], which depict him engaging in a set of adventures different from those of Herakles.
