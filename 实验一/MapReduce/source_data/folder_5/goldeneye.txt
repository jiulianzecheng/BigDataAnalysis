 '''''GoldenEye''''' is a 1995 [[United Kingdom|British]] action-adventure espionage movie. It was released in November 1995. Starring in this are [[Pierce Brosnan]] (as [[James Bond]]) and [[Judi Dench]] (she plays M). ''GoldenEye'' was the seventeenth spy feature in the James Bond series. This was also the first one after a six-year break, which was the result of legal disputes. ''GoldenEye'' made over $350 million worldwide. According to critics, Brosnan acted the role of James Bond much better than his predecessor [[Timothy Dalton]]. [[Tina Turner]] sings the title song of the movie.
