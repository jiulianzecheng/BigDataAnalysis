 '''''Temnodontosaurus''''' was an [[ichthyosaur]] from the early [[Jurassic]], some 196 to 190 million years ago. It was found in [[England]] by [[Mary Anning]], and later in [[Germany]]. It was, in fact, her first ichthyosaur. Her brother found the skull, and she found the rest of the skeleton, in about 1810. It was described in 1814.  
 
 There are four or five species of ''Temnodontosaurus''. They grew to [[killer whale]] size, about 30 to 40 feet. < ref > The first-found species, ''T. platyodon'', is the smallest one. < /ref > 
 
 This huge ichthyosaur cruised the [[wikt:shallow|shallow]] seas hunting. But hunting what? A discussion by Christopher McGowan suggests that other reptiles might have been on the menu. < ref > McGowan, Christopher 1997. ''The raptor and the lamb: predators and prey in the living world''. Henry Holt and Penguin, p192. {{ISBN|0-14-027264-X}} < /ref >  McGowan also mentions that in the museum collections are some teeth and bones which suggest even larger ichthyosaurs existed. 
 
 == Eye size == 
 Ichthyosaurs hold the record for eye size: the largest was 264mm in diameter (~10.4 & nbsp;inches), from the species ''Temnodontosaurus platyodon''. < ref > [[David Attenborough]] on ''Temnodontosaurus''. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv3WhUqpKhE] < /ref >  This is the largest eye ever recorded for any [[vertebrate]]; the [[colossal squid]] eye is larger still. < ref name= " UCMP " > University of California Museum of Paleontology: Motani's Ichthyosaur page [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/motani/ichthyo/eyes.html] < /ref >  The eyes are surrounded by sclerotic rings, a kind of bony support.
