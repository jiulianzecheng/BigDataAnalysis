 In [[geography]], a '''marsh''' is a type of [[wetland]]. It has [[grass]]es, [[rush]]es, [[Reed (plant)|reeds]], [[typha]]s, [[sedge]]s, and other herbaceous [[plant]]s (possibly with low-growing woody plants) in a context of shallow [[water]].  A marsh is different from a [[swamp]], which has a greater proportion of open water surface, which is generally deeper than a marsh. In the US, the term 'swamp' is used for wetland dominated by trees rather than grasses and low herbs.

 The water of a marsh can be [[fresh water|fresh]], [[brackish]] or [[salinity|saline]]. Coastal marshes may be associated with [[Estuary|estuaries]] and along waterways between coastal [[barrier island]]s and the inner coast.  Estuarine marshes often are based on soils consisting of sandy bottoms or [[bay mud]]s. 
 
 Marshes are critically important wildlife [[habitat]], often serving as breeding grounds for a wide variety of [[animal]] life.
