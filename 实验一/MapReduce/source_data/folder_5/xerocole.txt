A '''xerocole''' (from [[Greek language|Modern Greek]] xēros [[:en:Help:IPA English|/ˈzɪroʊs/]], meaning 'dry', and [[Latin]] col(ere), meaning 'to inhabit'), is an animal [[Adaptation|adapted]] to live in the [[desert]]. The main problems these animals face are very little water to drink, and a very hot environment. Xerocoles tend to be [[nocturnal]] or [[crepuscular]] to escape the heat. 
 
 ==Saving up water== 
 Xerocoles have many ways to conserve (save up) the water in their body. Most xerocoles do not [[sweat]], or sweat very little. Many desert birds and [[mammal|mammals]] have oils on their skin to prevent water from escaping. There is also very little water in their [[urine]] and [[feces]].
