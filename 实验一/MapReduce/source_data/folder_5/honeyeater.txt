 A '''honeyeater''' is one of a large family of small to medium-sized birds which feed on [[nectar]]. They are most common in [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]], but are also found in [[New Zealand]], the [[Pacific]] islands as far east as [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]], and the islands to the north and west of New Guinea. [[Bali]], on the other side of the [[Wallace Line]], has a single [[species]]. 
 
 Honeyeaters and the Australian '''chats''' ([[Epthianura]]) make up the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Meliphagidae'''. In total there are 182 [[species]] in 42 [[genera]]. < ref > as listed in Sibley  &  Monroe 1990. < /ref >  About half of them live in Australia, and many of the others are from  New Guinea.  Although honeyeaters look and behave much like other nectar-feeding birds around the world (such as the [[sunbird]]s and [[flowerpecker]]s), they are not related. 
 
 There is an important partnership between honeyeaters and Australian [[flowering plants]]. A great many Australian plants are fertilised by honeyeaters, particularly the [[Proteaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], and [[Epacridaceae]]. It is known that the honeyeaters are important in [[New Zealand]] as well, and scientists believe they are just as important in other areas.

 Unlike the [[hummingbird]]s of America, honeyeaters do not usually [[hover]] (beat their wings fast to stay in the same air space). However, smaller members of the family do hover hummingbird-style to collect nectar from time to time. Usually honeyeaters move quickly from perch to perch in the outer leaves, stretching up or sideways or hanging upside. Many honeyeaters have a highly developed brush-tipped tongue, covered with bristles which soak up liquids readily. The tongue is flicked rapidly and repeatedly into a flower, the upper [[mandible]] then squeezes liquid out when the bill is closed. 
 
 As well as nectar, all or nearly all honeyeaters take insects and other small creatures, usually by catching them in the air, sometimes by picking them off plants. A few of the larger species, such as the [[white-eared honeyeater]], and the [[strong-billed honeyeater]] of [[Tasmania]], search under bark for insects. Many species also eat fruit, and a small number eat large amounts of fruit, < ref name=EoB > {{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Lindsey, Terence|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 208|isbn= 1-85391-186-0}} < /ref >  particularly in [[tropical rainforests]] and in semi-[[arid]] [[scrubland]]. The [[painted honeyeater]] is a [[mistletoe]] specialist. Most, however, live on a diet of nectar and insects. In general, the honeyeaters with long, fine bills eat more nectar, the shorter-billed species less so, but even specialised nectar eaters like the [[spinebill]]s take extra insects to add protein to their diet when they are breeding. 
 
 The movements of honeyeaters are poorly understood. Many follow the flowering of favourite food plants. Arid zone species appear to travel further and less predictably than those of the more fertile areas. It seems probable that no single explanation will emerge: the general rule for honeyeater movements is that there is no general rule.
