 A '''Fountain''' is an arrangement, usually made by man; in it, the [[water]] from a [[river source|source]] is captured in some way. Most often, it is used to fill a [[basin]] of some kind. Sometimes there are many basins, and water runs from one into the next. It is also common to have [[sculpture]]s in fountains.  
 
 Sometimes jets are used to make the water go high into the air, using [[pressure]].
