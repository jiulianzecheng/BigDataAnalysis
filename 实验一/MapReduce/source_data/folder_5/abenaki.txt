 == History == 
 Large confederacies like the [[Iroquois]] wanted to take over Abenaki land. Agriculture helped the Abenaki to become more powerful and resist such attacks. < ref > Muir, Diana, ''Reflections in Bullough's Pond'', University Press of New England. < /ref > 
 
 The Abenaki had contact with [[French colonial empire|French]] and [[British Empire|English]] colonists in the 17th century. They got involved in the fur trade and often allied with the French. Soon they had to move out of their lands to [[Quebec]]. This was because there was tension with Colonists. There was also [[disease]] that made the Abenaki population smaller. The Abenaki lost several wars and had to move to Quebec in [[Canada]]. < ref > Spencer C. Tucker; et al., eds. (2011).

 == Culture == 
 The Abenaki were made of small groups of people. Small family groups were led by a chief. The chief helped the group make decisions that the majority could accept. There was also a chief for war. The groups also tried to develop relations with other groups and tribes. Groups usually met in the spring and summer. In the society, descendants were based on the father's side (partrilineal). 
 
 Telling stories was part of the culture. People told stories from one generation to the next. Storytelling was also a way to teach children how to act. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2010-02-10|title=Abenaki|url=http://www.abenakination.org/stories.html|access-date=2022-07-31|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2010-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210183130/http://www.abenakination.org/stories.html|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > 
 
 The people had different types of foods and goods. Tribe members went fishing and hunting.  They also grew special plants and collected wild plants for food. The [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]] squash, corn and beans were also eaten. They often used plants for medical problems. < ref > {{Cite web|title=BRIT - Native American Ethnobotany Database|url=http://naeb.brit.org/uses/search/filtered/?string= & tribe=1 & use_category=1|access-date=2022-07-31|website=naeb.brit.org}} < /ref >
