 A '''debutante''' is a young [[woman]] who is first introduced into [[society]]. In former times, these young ladies would be part of [[nobility]], or the [[upper class]]. Originally, the term meant the young person was now old enough to be married. The purpose of the coming out was to display her to eligible [[bachelor]]s and their families. The term comes from [[French language|French]], and can be translated as  " beginner " .  
 
 In those days, a young lady of quality could not meet anyone unless they were introduced to her. This introduction could happen at an event (such as a [[Ball (dance)|ball]]) which was part of the '[[season (society)|season]]'. In the [[United Kingdom]] there was a formal presentation of the debutants to the [[monarch]] at the [[Royal Court]] (abolished by the present [[Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]] in 1957). According to the [[peerage]] guide [[Debrett's]], the traditional social season runs from April to August. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://debretts.com/memoirs-of-a-debutante/ |title=Memoirs of a Debutante
