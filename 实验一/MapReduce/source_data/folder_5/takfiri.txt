A '''Takfiri''' is a [[Muslim]] who says that another Muslim has apostated (left the religion).  'Takfiri' comes from the word ''[[kafir]]'', meaning somebody who does not follow [[Islam]]. The ideology partially comes from [[hadith]]ic (from narrations from Muhammad's life) requirements to ''enjoin [instruct someone to follow] the good and forbid the evil''. < ref > 2010 Amil Khan, The Long Struggle, p 88 < /ref >
