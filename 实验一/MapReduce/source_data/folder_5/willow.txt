 '''Willows''' are a group of [[trees]] and [[shrub]]s which may be called sallows or osiers. Their [[Latin language|Latin]] name is ''Salix''. 
 
 Willows have many differences in [[size]] and type of growth, but are very much alike in other respects. There are about 350 [[species]] of this plant, usually found on moist [[soil]]s in cooler zones in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Many [[hybrid]]s are known, both naturally occurring and in cultivation, because willows are very fertile. 
 
 Willows have watery bark sap, charged with [[salicylic acid]] ([[defence against herbivory]]). They have soft, usually pliant (bendy), tough wood, slender branches, and large, fibrous, often [[stolon]]iferous [[roots]]. The roots are remarkable for their toughness, size, and are hard to kill. Roots readily sprout from aerial parts of the plant. 
 
 Willows are [[dioecious]], with male and female flowers appearing as catkins on separate plants. The catkins are produced early in the spring, often before the leaves.
