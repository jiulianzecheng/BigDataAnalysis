 The '''Galician Institute of Aquaculture Training''' ( '''IGaFA''' or '''IGAFA''' ) is an educational body dependent on the ''Dirección Xeral de Innovación e Desenvolvemento'' (Directorate General of Innovation and Development) of the Consellería de Pesca e Asuntos Marítimos (Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs) of the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] autonomous government ([[Xunta de Galicia]]). It is co-financed by the European Social Fund. Courses are taught for obtaining the certificates of shell fisherman, [[Aquaculture|aquaculturist]] and specialist in marine cultures. 
 
 The center is located in the municipality of Arousa Island ([[Illa de Arousa]]). 
 
 == History == 
 The first attempts to found a  " Pisciculture "  center in the Ría de Arousa were due to Antón Vila Nadal, at the end of the 19th century, when he proposed the creation of a single Galician Biological Station, located in [[Carril]]. In the pamphlet ''Objeto y descripción del Acuario Ambulante de la Estación Zoológica de Barcelona y Escuela de Piscicultura de Arosa'' (1892)  < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://biblioteca.galiciana.gal/gl/consulta/registro.do?id=530269|title=Objeto y descripción del Acuario Ambulante de la Estación Zoológica de Barcelona y Escuela de Piscicultura de Arosa|date=1892|publisher=[s. n.]}} < /ref >  he explained the details and set out his ideas about the Station. In 1900 the first stone of the Station was laid in Carril. Under the auspices of the reform of the Museum of Natural Sciences, the establishment was intended to be created, dependent on the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] and in charge of the professor of Natural History. However, it was not until 1952 that the Marine Research Institute was created in Vigo.  < ref > {{Cite web|title=Historia|url=http://www.iim.csic.es/index.php/historia/|language=es|access-date=2022-02-25|archive-date=2022-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203081635/http://www.iim.csic.es/index.php/historia/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Much later, public bodies such as the Center for the Control of the Marine Environment (CCMM), CIMA and INTECMAR were created. 
 
 In the second half of [[1980s|the 80's]], during the [[President of the Regional Government of Galicia|presidency of the Xunta]] de [[Fernando González Laxe|González Laxe]], the IGAFA was tendered, the main architect was Pascuala Campos de Michelena, and others collaborated such as Rodríguez Abilleira and Teresa Táboas. Formally, they sought continuity with the large number of canneries on the island, < ref > {{Cite web|title=IGAFA|url=http://culturagalega.gal/album/docs/CCG_ig_album_pascuala_obradoiro_20.pdf}} < /ref >  and the Museo do Mar de Galicia, designed in Vigo by César Portela, bears similarities to the IGAFA building. It was inaugurated in 1992, under the presidency of [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Fraga Iribarne]]. 
 
 Since 2005, IGaFA has been the '' " National Center for Occupational Vocational Training in the Aquaculture Training Area " '' and has been ISO 9001: 2000 certified by the Quality Management System.
