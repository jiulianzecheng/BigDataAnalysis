'''Rickrolling''' is an [[internet meme]] that involves playing a trick on someone by tricking them into listening to [[Rick Astley]] singing his 1987 song,  " [[Never Gonna Give You Up]] " . It was first seen on [[4chan]] and is called a  " bait and switch " . A  " bait and switch "  happens when the prankster gives a [[website]] to someone saying that the [[URL|website address]] (which is somehow hidden) is about something else. When the victim clicks the link, they see the music video and have been  " rickrolled "  or  " rickroll'd " . 
 
 As rickrolling has grown in popularity, two of the many videos online have been watched over 13 million times each. < ref > {{cite web|date=2007-05-15|publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0|title=RickRoll'D|accessdate=2008-12-28}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|date=2008-03-25|publisher=YouTube|last=YouTube staff|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu_moia-oVI|title=Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up|accessdate=2008-12-28}} < /ref >

 ===Origin of the term=== 
 Rickrolling is said to have begun as a [[spin-off]] of an earlier [[Practical jokes|prank]] called ''duckrolling'', < ref name= " hoaxonwheels " > {{cite web |work=FOX News|publisher=[[FOX News Network]]|date=2008-04-22|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream |accessdate=2008-04-22}} < /ref >  which was when a link was supposed to lead to a picture or news story but would really link to an edited picture of a duck on wheels. The victim was then said to have been '''duckrolled'''. The first [[wikt:instance|instance]] of rickrolling happened in [[May]] [[2007]] on the [[4chan]] video game board, where a link to the video was said to be a copy of the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto IV. The joke was [[wikt:confined|confined]] to 4chan for a short time. < ref name= " hoaxonwheels " / >
