 ORCIDs usually have four groups of four numbers. An example of a person with an ORCID is [[John Wilbanks]]. His ORCID is  < nowiki > https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385 < /nowiki > . < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780-structure-of-the-orcid-identifier |title=Structure of the ORCID Identifier |publisher=ORCID |access-date=2014-05-30 |archive-date=2018-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122190739/https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780-structure-of-the-orcid-identifier |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  That is also the web address of the page about him, on the ORCID website. His ORCID can also be written as  " ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385 " . < ref name= " Asakura " > {{cite web|url=http://www.hindawi.com/80647648/|title=Hiroshi Asakura|publisher=[[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]]|accessdate=20 April 2014|archive-date=1 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101214652/http://www.hindawi.com/80647648/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Sometimes an ORCID has an  " X "  instead of a number at the end. An example of this is [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Nick Jennings]]'s ORCID. His is  < nowiki > https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X < /nowiki > . The final number (or  " X " ) is a [[check digit]].
