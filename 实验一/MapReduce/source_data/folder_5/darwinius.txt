 '''''Darwinius''''' is a [[genus]] of [[primates]] known from only one [[fossil]]. It was discovered in 1983 by an amateur at the [[Messel Pit]]. This is a disused [[shale]] [[quarry]] noted for its astonishing fossil preservation, near the village of Messel, about 35 km (22 miles) southeast of [[Frankfurt am Main]] in Germany. 
 
 The fosssil dates from the [[Eocene]] epoch, 47 million years ago. < ref > Mertz D.F.  &  Renne P.R. 2005. A numerical age for the Messel fossil deposit (UNESCO World Heritage Site) derived from 40Ar/39Ar dating on a basaltic rock fragment. ''Courier Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg'' 255: pp 7â€“75. < /ref >  The genus ''Darwinius'' was named to celebrate [[Charles Darwin]] on his bicentenary and the species name ''masillae'' honors Messel, where the specimen was found. The creature appeared superficially similar to a modern [[lemur]]. It is the only known specimen of its [[species]]. 
 
 The fossil, nicknamed 'Ida', was divided into a slab and partial counterslab after the excavation. The two parts were sold separately, was not reassembled until 2007.  
 
 == Description == 
 The specimen was privately collected and sold in two parts. Only the lesser part was known earlier. The second part shows that the skeleton is the complete primate fossil known. It includes the skeleton, soft body outline and contents of the [[digestive tract]]. < ref name=Franzen/ >   
 
 Skull [[radiography]] shows teeth developing within the juvenile face. The individual was a weaned and independent-feeding female that died in her first year of life. She was  " an agile, [[nail (anatomy)|nail]]-bearing, generalized [[arboreal]] [[quadruped]] living above the floor of the Messel [[rain forest]] " . < ref name=Franzen >  Franzen J.L.
