 '''DSLinux''' is a port of the [[Linux]] operating system to the [[Nintendo DS]] platform. It requires only a device capable of writing to a [[DS Game Cart]]. 
 
 DSLinux is not the same as DSL ([[Damn Small Linux]].) 
 
 == Criticism == 
 DSLinux has been criticized, some of these thing are for: 
 * Hard to use 
 * Hard to install (few devices capable of writing to a [[DS Game Cart]]), not really true if you're using a 2DS or 3DS.
