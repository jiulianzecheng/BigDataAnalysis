 An '''amulet''' (from [[Latin]] ''amuletum'', meaning  " charm " ), is an object that people think will bring good [[luck]] and or [[protection]] to its owner. 
 
 Usually amulets are [[gemstone|gems]], [[statue]]s, [[coin]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[pendant]]s, [[ring]]s, [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, etc. Even [[word]]s can be amulets, such as ''vade retro satana''â€”([[Latin]],  " go back, [[Satan]] " ), to make bad luck go away.
