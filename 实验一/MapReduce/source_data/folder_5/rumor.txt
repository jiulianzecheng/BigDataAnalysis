A '''rumor''' or '''rumour'''  is often thought as [[myth]] or [[tall tale]] surrounding a person that might or might not be true. However, a review of the research on rumor made by Pendleton in 1998 found that research across [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and communication studies had made definitions of rumor. < ref > Pendleton, S.c. (1998), 'Rumor research revisited and expanded', Language & 
 Communication, vol. 1. no. 18, pp. 69-86.
