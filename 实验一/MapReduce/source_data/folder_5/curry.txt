 '''Curry''' (from [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''kari'') is the English word for any of a general variety of [[spice]]d dishes, best known in [[India]]n, [[Bangladesh]]i, [[Sri Lanka]]n, [[Indonesia]]n, [[Malaysia]]n, [[Pakistani]], [[Thailand|Thai]], and other [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n cuisines. Curry has also been adopted into many other cuisines. Curry first came from [[India]]. The idea of curry was later brought to the [[Western world|West]] by British colonialists in India from the 18th century. Dishes that are often called curries in Europe and America are rarely called curries in the native language. 
 
 Curry can also be found in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Jamaica]]. It is usually eaten with [[Basmati rice]] or [[naan]], a type of flat bread. 
 
 A curry dish called Balti is said to have been originated in [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]] and has been dubbed Britainâ€™s de facto national dish. < ref > {{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-18494918 | title=What makes the Birmingham Balti unique? | work=BBC News | date=19 June 2012 }} < /ref >
