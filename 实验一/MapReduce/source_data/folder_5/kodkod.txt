 The '''kodkod''' (''Leopardus guigna'') is the smallest cat in the [[Americas]], found in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. < ref name=msw3 / >  It is sometimes called the '''güiña'''. They are closely related to the other small cats of South America, such as the [[Ocelot]] and the [[Margay]]. 
 
 Kodkods live in mixed [[temperate rainforest]]s of the southern [[Andes]]. They also live in the [[coast]]al forests of Chile, which have [[bamboo]] in the understory of the forest. They prefer [[evergreen]] [[temperate rainforest]]s. They are tolerant of altered habitats, and are found in secondary forest and shrub as well as primary forest, and on the fringes of settled and cultivated areas. < ref > Nowell K.  &  Jackson P. 1996.

 Kodkods are active during the day and night, but they only go into open ground under the cover of darkness. During the day, they rest in dense vegetation in ravines, along streams with heavy cover. They are excellent climbers, and easily able to climb trees more than a meter in diameter. They are terrestrial predators of [[bird]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[rodent]]s in the ravines and forested areas. 
 
 Male kodkods maintain exclusive territories {{convert|1.1|to|2.5|km2|mi2}} in size, while females occupy smaller ranges of just {{convert|0.5|to|0.7|km2|mi2}}. < ref > Sunquist, Mel  &  Sunquist, Fiona 2002.
