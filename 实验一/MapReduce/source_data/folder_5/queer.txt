 Queer is mostly used by younger [[LGBT]] people to describe themselves and is usually described as a  " fluid "  label. Many people like the term in the LGBT community as it focuses on what that community has in common and not its differences. But many older LGBT people may find the term  " queer "  to be offensive due to its use as a [[homophobia|homophobic]] insult. < ref name=PFLAG1 / >  Some queer folks may or may not be [[genderqueer]] (of non-binary gender).
