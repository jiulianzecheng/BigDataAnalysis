Overactivity of growth [[hormone]] during childhood causes this condition in humans. < ref > {{DorlandsDict|four/000044375|Gigantism}} < /ref >  The growth hormone is one of the hormones that is released from the interior pituitary gland. If a person has been exposed to very high level of growth hormones before their growth plates have merged during childhood for example, this can be lead to the condition of gigantism.
