 The '''Pleistocene''' stage or epoch was a long period of time. It stretched from 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago. < ref > ''International Commission on Stratigraphy'' (ICS). [http://www.quaternary.stratigraphy.org.uk/correlation/GSAchron09.jpg ICS geologic time scale] < /ref >  The Pleistocene followed the [[Pliocene]]. It is the first [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Quaternary]] period and the sixth in the [[Cainozoic]], and  is followed by the present [[Holocene]].  
 
 The Pleistocene was a time of [[ice age]]s: cold glacial periods with shorter, warmer, interglacials. Ice ages are when the world becomes much colder for a long time. In much of the 20th century geologists counted four  " major "  ice ages. Nowadays several more are called  " major " . During these glaciations, much of the world we know was covered by ice: North America down to and past the [[Great Lakes]]; all of northern [[Russia]], and [[Europe]]; [[England]] down to the [[Thames]]. 
 
 Many animals that lived then have become [[extinct]]. [[Climate change]] and [[hunting]] by humans were responsible. < ref > Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. eds 1984. ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. Arizona, Tucson AZ. < /ref >  Many of the mammals were larger cold-adapted versions of animals that live now. [[Glyptodon]] was something like a giant [[armadillo]]. [[Mammoth]]s were a species of [[elephant]] in the ice age. Their popular name of [[woolly mammoth]] suggests the long hair which was an [[adaptation]] to the cold.  
 
 Ancient human species lived during the Pleistocene. In Europe and Asia the large-brained [[Neanderthal]] (''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'') lived until about 30,000 years ago. Modern man did not descend from Neanderthals, but originated in [[Africa]] from another branch of the [[genus]]. < ref > Klein, Richard G. 2009.
