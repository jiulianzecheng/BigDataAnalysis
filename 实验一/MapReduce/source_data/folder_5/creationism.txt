 '''Creationism''' is the religious belief that the [[universe]] was created in the way described in [[religious]] books. According to [[Genesis]], [[God]] directly created life from the nothingness that was before, by fixing the [[Chaos (mythology)|chaos]] that was.  Other religions have different [[creation myth]]s.  The first approach is known as creatio [[ex nihilo]], which is the [[Latin]] name for ''creation from nothing''. 
 
 The idea that God created the world has been taught for thousands of years by writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo]]. 
 
 Creationism as it is known today was started in the 19th century by [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] who were opposed to the theories that [[scientist]]s began to put forward about [[geology]] and [[evolution]]. 
 
 In the 20th century, creationist movements also started in [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. 
 
 == Belief == 
 Creationists do not believe that all of today's living things came about from simple [[organism]]s changing or [[evolution|evolving]] slowly over time. They  believe that life was created much as it is today, and that one form of life cannot change into another. [[Biologist]]s and [[paleontologist]]s say that [[fossil]]s are different from the life we see today, and can be put into order to show changes over time. [[Young Earth Creationism]] says life was created in a short time, in its current form. They point to the [[Deluge myth|Flood of Noah]] to account for most rock formations and most fossils. There is also an [[Old Earth creationism]]. 
 
 == Christian Creationism == 
 [[Young Earth Creationism]] goes completely against conventional [[geochronology]]. This kind of creationism says God created the earth roughly 6,000 or 10,000 years ago as told in [[Genesis]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/evolution/bldef_youngearth.htm |title=Young Earth Creationism |access-date=2014-02-19 |archive-date=2014-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709132953/http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/evolution/bldef_youngearth.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Young Earth Creationists believe that God created the world in six days (with God resting on the seventh) as the Book of Genesis says.  Young Earth Creationism says that [[Deluge myth|Noah's flood]] is important to creationism. They argue that  " the first buried fossils of each group are complete and complex (complicated), strong support for the biblical concept (idea) that each kind of life was created well designed to multiply after its own kind. "  They believe that the Bible is literally true (see [[Biblical inerrancy]]).  Some people say a problem with this is that fossils appear in layers called [[strata]].  Fossils that [[Paleontology|paleontologist]]s believe evolved earlier are found in rocks that [[geologist]]s think are older. Fossils that [[Paleontology|paleontologist]]s believe evolved later are found in different rocks that [[geologist]]s think are younger. If fossils were of animals drowned in the flood scientists think they would be mixed together. < ref > [http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/worldwideflood.htm Can Noah's flood account for the geologic and fossil record?] < /ref >  Christian creationists say this happened because of the [[Noah|Noahic Flood]], and point to fossils of animals that died quickly. They offer many defenses. Some of these are: 
 
 # Fossils that were buried quickly, as in [[Lagerstätte]]n. One fossil Creationists talk about is where one fish is eating another fish when it was buried. 
 # Polystrate fossils are fossils that go through multiple rock layers. [[Christian Science|Christian scientists]] say this can't happen if the rock layers were formed quickly 
 # Bent rock layers are rock layers that are bent in a way that Christian scientists say can not happen over millions of years. Christians say there are a lot of these. < ref > YouTube - ''Bill Nye Debates Ken Ham HD (Official)'' < /ref > 
 
 Other creationists believe God created everything between 13,000  and 14,000 [[million]] years ago.  This is called [[Old Earth Creationism]]. < ref > [http://carm.org/dictionary-creationism Creationism] < /ref > 
 
 Creationists point to the perfection of [[Earth]]'s size, shape, and distance as designed by [[God]], and Earth's ''im''perfections as proofs that the Earth is dirtied by humans' [[sin]]. 
 
 The term creationism can be used with more than one meaning.  
 #Sometimes creationism means that God created life and [[evolution]] did not happen. < ref > [http://royalsociety.org/events/2006/creationism-evolution/?gclid=CLfgu-aB2LwCFbPItAodxxsAJA Why creationism is wrong and evolution is right] < /ref > 
 #Other times creationism means just that God created everything but this could have happened long ago and [[theistic evolution]] may have happened. 
 
 [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal Christians]] do not believe in [[Biblical inerrancy]] and say God used evolution to create mankind and other [[life]]. This idea is called [[Theistic evolution|theistic evolution.]] 
 
 == Islamic Creationism == 
 Islamic creationism is the belief that the [[universe]] (including [[human race|humanity]]) was directly created by [[Allah]] as in the [[Qur'an]]. Currently, [[Islam]] takes religious texts literally. Many scholars say that [[Genesis]] is a corrupted version of God's message. There is also a [[creation myth]] in the Qu'ran, but it is more vague than Genesis. This allows for more interpretation. Several [[liberal movements within Islam]] generally accept the scientific positions on the age of the earth, the age of the universe and evolution. 
 
 Islam also has its own form of [[Theistic evolution]], which says that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Many liberal Muslims believe in evolutionary creationism. 
 
 [[Khalid Anees]], president of the [[Islamic Society of Britain]] attended a conference called 'Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools'. During that conference, he made points including the following: < ref name=guardian0104 > {{cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html|title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools|date=2004-01-07|work=Guardian|first=David |last=Papineau |accessdate=2008-07-18}} < /ref >   There is no contradiction between what is revealed in the [[Quran]] and [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]], do not agree that one species can develop from another. Other Muslims do believe that one species can develop from another. < ref name= " PrizeforFossil " > {{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/creationist-offers-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution-945289.html | title=Creationist offers prize for fossil proof of evolution | work=[[The Independent]] | date=29 September 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate=2007-05-17 | archive-date=2008-12-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224211744/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/creationist-offers-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution-945289.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 But there is also a growing movement of [[Islamic creationism]]. Like the movement in Christianity, Islamic creationists are concerned that the findings of evolutionary theory might contradict what is written in the Qu'ran. 
 
 There are several verses in the Qur'an which some modern writers have interpreted as being compatible with the [[Redshift|expansion of the universe]], [[Big Bang]] and [[Big Crunch]] theories: < ref > [[Harun Yahya]], [http://www.harunyahya.com/articles/70big_bang.html The Big Bang Echoes through the Map of the Galaxy] < /ref > < ref > [[Maurice Bucaille]] (1990), ''The Bible the Qur'an and Science'',  " The Quran and Modern Science " , {{ISBN|81-7101-132-2}}. < /ref > < ref > A. Abd-Allah, [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html The Qur'an, Knowledge, and Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128054613/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html |date=2008-11-28 }}, [[University of Southern California]]. < /ref > 
 < blockquote > " Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were ˹once˺ one mass then We split them apart? And We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? " {{qref|21|30|s=y|b=yl}} < /blockquote > 
 < blockquote > " Then He turned towards the heaven when it was ˹still like˺ smoke, saying to it and to the earth, ‘Submit, willingly or unwillingly.’ They both responded, ‘We submit willingly.’ " {{qref|41|11|s=y|b=yl}} < /blockquote >

 == Baha'i creationism == 
 The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers the creation narratives in previous [[Abrahamic religion]]s to be symbolic and not literal. Bahá'í Faith also accepts that the Earth is ancient. Baha'ullah existed at the same time as [[Charles Darwin]], so was aware of Darwin's works. 
 
 == Scientific criticism == 
 Religious communities in the United States encourage the inclusion of [[supernatural]] explanations of the origins of both life and the universe as a whole. Evolution was not included in school textbooks until the 1960s  
 In 1987, the [[Edwards v. Aguillard|United States Supreme Court]] acknowledged creationism is not scientific, and should not be taught in public schools. < ref > [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8408_statements_from_scientific_and_12_19_2002.asp The National Center for Science Education's collection of statements by scientific societies in support of evolution.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328150011/http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8408_statements_from_scientific_and_12_19_2002.asp |date=2008-03-28 }} The National Center of Science Education and the Royal Society agree with this decision. < /ref > < ref > {{cite news | title =Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design  | language =English  | publisher =The Royal Society  | date =2006-04-11 | url =http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year= & id=4298  | accessdate =2007-09-12}} < /ref >
