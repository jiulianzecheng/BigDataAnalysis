[[Image:Villainc.svg|thumb|right|150px|This is a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] villain. Many people think about something like this when they hear or see the word  " villain " .]] 
 A '''villain''' is a [[evil|bad]] person in [[fiction]]. The word comes from a [[Latin]] word meaning a [[Feudalism|feudal]] farm worker or [[peasant]]. Villains, or [[antagonist]]s, are usually found in [[fiction]], such as [[movie]]s, [[television show]]s, [[cartoon]]s, [[comics]], [[anime]], [[novel]]s and [[video game]]s. The audience do not usually like the villain and they support the [[hero]] or [[heroine]]. However, in some cases the villain is more praised by the public than the hero, as the example of [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in the [[Batman]] franchise. In some movies and books (such as the movie [[Ocean's Eleven]]), the [[antagonist]] is a good person and the [[Protagonist|main character]] is bad (such as a robber). When used in [[comic book]]s, they are [[wikt:depict|depicted]] as [[Supervillain|supervillains]]. Supervillains usually hold some kind of unnatural force.
