 '''Subwoofer''' is a type of [[loudspeaker]] that is designed to produce low [[frequency|frequencies]], example 20 - 200 [[Hz]]. Usually subwoofers are quite big and heavy.  
 we can not typically hear frequencies below 20 Hz. In some cases, with enough sound pressure, the listener will not hear the sound but will be able to feel it.
