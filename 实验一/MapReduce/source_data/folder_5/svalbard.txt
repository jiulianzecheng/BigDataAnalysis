 '''Svalbard''' is a [[Archipelago|group of island]]s in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. It is the most northern part of [[Norway]]. It is about halfway between mainland Norway and the [[North Pole]]. [[Spitsbergen]] is the largest island, followed by [[Nordaustlandet]] and [[Edgeøya]]. The islands are governed by the [[Governor of Svalbard]]. The government is located at [[Longyearbyen]]. Other settlements include research outposts, the Russian mining community of [[Barentsburg]], the research community of [[Ny-Ålesund]] and the mining outpost of [[Sveagruva]]. 
 
 The islands were first used as a [[whaling]] base in the 17th and 18th centuries. After this, they were abandoned. [[Coal mining]] started at the beginning of the 20th century, and several permanent villages were built. The [[Spitsbergen Treaty]] of 1920 states that Norway is in control of Svalbard. The 1925 [[Svalbard Act]] made Svalbard part of Norway. These treaties also set out rules that economic activities could be done freely and that no military activities can take place. There are only two mining companies, one Norwegian and one Russian. Research and tourism are important industries. There are no roads to connect the settlements. Instead, [[snowmobile]]s, aircraft and boats serve as transport. [[Svalbard Airport]] in Longyearbyen is the main airport. 
 
 In summer, the plants grow quickly (one plant every 25-78 days) during the [[midnight sun]]. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds. There are also [[polar bear]]s, [[reindeer]], and [[mammal]]s that live in the sea. Seven [[national park]]s and 23 [[nature reserve]]s cover two-thirds of Svalbard. This protects the fragile natural environment. Sixty percent of land is covered by [[glacier]]s, and the islands have many mountains and [[fjord]]s. 
 
 Economy: coal mining is still being done in one mine (as of 2022). < ref > https://e24.no/naeringsliv/i/ALM8mr/vil-utsette-stengingen-av-norges-siste-kullgruve?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no. [[E24]].no. Retrieved April 3, 2022 < /ref > 
 
 ==Climate== 
 Svalbard's climate is a combination of an Arctic climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ET) tempered by the North Atlantic Current. Nordenskiöld Land is the warmest and wettest part of the archipelago, caused by the convergence of mild and humid air from the south and cold air from the north. Average summer highs are typically {{convert|3|to|7|C|F}} while average winter highs are {{convert|−11|to|−13|C|F}}. < ref name= " climate "  / >  Svalbard experiences [[midnight sun]] from 19 April through 23 August, [[polar night]] from 27 October through 14 February and civil polar night from 14 November through 29 January. However, due to shading from mountains, the sun is not visible in Svalbard until around 8 March. < ref name= " sunreturns " > {{cite web |url=http://suncurves.com/en/v/7188/ |title=Sunrise and sunset times for Longyearbyen |accessdate=28 April 2014 |publisher=Suncurves}} < /ref >  Snow typically covers the town from November through March. The warmest temperature ever record in Svalbard was an extraordinary {{convert|25.0|C|F}} in July 1977 and the coldest was a frigid {{convert|-46.3|C|F}} in March 1986. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/ws-10080.html|title=Climate Svalbard Lufthavn - Climate data (10080)|first=Tutiempo Network|last=S.L|website=www.tutiempo.net}} < /ref > 
 
 Despite its extreme northerly location, Svalbard has recorded a temperature above freezing in all months. One example was in February 2012, when the mild temperatures had an affect on both people and wildlife. The climate is known to be warming very rapidly. Svalbard has also not recorded a temperature below freezing in July. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fast-warming-arctic-proves-deadly-to-animals-and-people/|title=Fast-Warming Arctic Proves Deadly to Animals and People|first=Christa|last=Marshall,ClimateWire|website=Scientific American}} < /ref > 
 
 Warm temperatures can occasionally occur in Summer. The most recent warm spell was at the end of July to the beginning of August in 2015, when the mercury hit {{convert|18.0|C|F}}. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/07-2015/ws-10080.html|title=Climate Svalbard Lufthavn (July 2015) - Climate data (10080)|first=Tutiempo Network|last=S.L|website=www.tutiempo.net}} < /ref > 
 
 Bjornoya (Bear Island) holds the record for the lowest average annual sunshine total in Europe, at just 595 hours, sunnier than some parts of Scotland. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/o/i/Fact_sheet_No._9_Updated.pdf |title=National Meteorological Library and Archive Fact sheet 9 — Weather extremes |access-date=2015-08-21 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032038/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/o/i/Fact_sheet_No._9_Updated.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Conversely, Longyearbyen, further to the north-west, receives almost twice as much sunshine as Bjornoya. < ref name= " climatemps.com " > {{cite web|url=http://www.svalbard.climatemps.com/sunlight.php|title=Sunshine  &  Daylight Hours in Isfjord Radio, Svalbard, Norway Sunlight, Cloud  &  Day length|website=www.svalbard.climatemps.com}} < /ref >
