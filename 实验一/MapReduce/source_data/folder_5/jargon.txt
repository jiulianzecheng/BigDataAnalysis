'''Jargon''' is a special way to use words that are shared only by a certain group of people.  They may not mean what the [[dictionary]] says they mean.  They have different [[meaning]]s to the people using them than their everyday meaning. 
 
 For example, the ordinary words ''boot'', ''net'', and ''web'' also have special meanings for users of [[computer]]s, the [[Internet]], and the [[World Wide Web]].  These, and to [[flame]], to [[ping]] and many [[acronym]]s are part of [[Internet slang|net jargon]]. 
 
 An ''acronym'' means that only some of the letters in the word or phrase are used.  Often this is the first letter of each word. Other acronyms found online are simply common shorthand. 
 
 Usually, more jargon is [[create]]d over time. 
 
 Jargon is common in the [[military]] and other complex organisations. It includes [[phrase]]s like [[SNAFU]]. 
 
 Jargon can be used by a [[clique]] to prevent others from joining or understanding, but it also is often just used because it is shorter.
