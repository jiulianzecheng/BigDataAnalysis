 '''Sunderland''' is in [[North East England]]. It was a [[county borough]], and is now part of the [[City of Sunderland]] in [[Tyne and Wear]]. It sits at the mouth of the [[River Wear]]. 
 
 Sunderland started as three small villages: 
 * [[Monkwearmouth]] was created in 674 when [[Saint (catholic)|Saint]] [[Benedict Biscop]] started a [[monastery]]. Monkwearmouth is on the north side of the river. 
 * [[Bishopwearmouth]] was founded in 930. It is on the south side of the river. 
 * Sunderland, at the mouth of the river was a small fishing village. It was given a ''charter'' in 1179. The charter gave the people of the small town some rights which people outside the town did not have. 
 
 Sunderland grew as a port, mostly selling [[coal]] and [[salt]]. In the 1300s people began to build ships along the river bank. By 1835, the port of Sunderland was so important that its name was used when the three old villages became the a borough. Sunderland became a [[city]] in 1992. 
 
 A person born in Sunderland is sometimes called a ''[[Mackem]]''. 
 
 == History == 
 === Early history === 
 In 674, Benedict Biscop built the Wearmouth (''St. Peter's'') [[monastery]]. He was given the land by King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]]. Biscop's monastery was the first monastery built of stone in [[Northumbria]]. Biscop brought glass makers from [[France]]. This was the start of [[glass making]] in Britain. 
 
 In 686, the community was taken over by [[Ceolfrid]], and Wearmouth monastery and its other site in Jarrow became very important places of learning in [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. The library had about 300 books; all of them were hand written and painted. 
 [[File:St peters sunderland.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St. Peter's Church in Monkwearmouth. Only the porch and part of the west wall are what remain of the original monastery built in 674.]] 
 
 The [[Codex Amiatinus]], was written and painted at the monastery and was probably worked on by [[Bede]] who was born at Wearmouth in 673. 
 Bede wrote the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]] (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People)'' in 731. This is why he is often called ''The father of English history''. 
 In the late eighth century, the [[Vikings]] began to raid the coast, and by the middle of the ninth century, the monastery had been abandoned. 
 
 In 930, [[Athelstan|King Athelstan of England]] gave the land on the south bank of the river to the [[Bishop of Durham]]. This is why the area is still called Bishopwearmouth. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/implementation/conservation/conservationwalks/bishopwearmouth/bishop.origins.asp|title=Origins of Bishopwearmouth|accessdate=23 January 2007|archive-date=27 September 2007|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070927201702/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/public/editable/themes/environment/implementation/conservation/conservationwalks/bishopwearmouth/bishop.origins.asp|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 By 1100, the Bishopwearmouth parish included a small [[fishing]] village at the mouth of the river (modern day East End) known as 'Soender-land', or Asunder-land which became Sunderland. < ref > {{cite web|title=What's in a name?|url=http://www.sunderlandtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1512 & ArticleID=1962253|work=Sunderland Echo|accessdate=17 January 2007|archive-date=27 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032005/http://www.sunderlandtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1512 & ArticleID=1962253|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This settlement was granted a [[charter]] in 1179 by [[Hugh Pudsey]], then the Bishop of Durham. 
 
 By 1346, [[shipbuilding|ships were being built]] at Wearmouth. The merchant Thomas Menville started building ships so he could transport the things he wanted to sell. 
 
 In 1589, [[salt]] making started in Sunderland. Large vats, called ‘’panns’’, of [[seawater]] were put on coal fires. When the water boiled, the salt was left behind. This is known as salt panning. Today, the road leading to where the pans were is still called Pann's Bank. It is on the river bank near the city centre. As more coal was needed to heat the [[salt pan]]s, [[coal mining]] started in the area. Only poor quality coal was used in salt panning; the best coal was sold and shipped out of the town. This is why the port began to grow. This put Sunderland in competition for the first time with its coal-trading neighbour [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. 
 
 === 17th and 18th centuries === 
 [[File:HolyTrinitySunderland-apse.jpg|thumb|right|Holy Trinity church, built in 1719.]]Before the [[English Civil War]] in 1642, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] said Newcastle could be the only town in the east of England which could send coal by ship. This had a big impact on Sunderland, which was selling more and more coal. This created resentment towards Newcastle and towards the idea of having a king. When the civil war began, the mainly [[Protestant]] Sunderland sided with Parliament against the mostly [[Catholic]] Newcastle. This was good for Sunderland's business, because Parliament blockaded (blocked) the Tyne. This stopped the Newcastle coal trade and allowed the Sunderland coal trade to grow. When an army from [[Scotland]] came to fight the King, its base was set up in Sunderland. 
 
 The River Wear was not very deep, so the coal had to be loaded onto big boats called ''keels'' and taken downriver to the coal ships which were called ''colliers''. 
 
 In 1719, Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth were too big for the only [[:wikt:parish|parish]] church, which was in Bishopwearmouth. A new parish of Sunderland was created and [[Holy Trinity, Sunderland]] parish church was built. The three original settlements of Wearmouth (Bishopwearmouth, Monkwearmouth and Sunderland) had started to join up. This was because of the success of the port of Sunderland as well as the salt panning and the shipbuilding along the banks of the Wear. Around this time, Sunderland was also known as 'Sunderland-near-the-Sea'. < ref > {{cite news |last=Shegog |first=Eric |url=http://www2.citysun.ac.uk/minster/history.htm |title=Sunderland Minster |publisher=City of Sunderland College |accessdate=9 December 2006 |archive-date=27 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627223638/http://www2.citysun.ac.uk/minster/history.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === 19th century === 
 ==== Cholera ==== 
 [[Local government]] was divided between the three churches (Holy Trinity, Sunderland, [[Sunderland Minster|St. Michael's, Bishopwearmouth]], and [[St. Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth]]). When [[cholera]] broke out in 1831, the  " select vestrymen " , as the church councillors were called, did not know what to do about the [[epidemic]]. Many were frightened to say that a disease has started because it might stop their businesses from making money. They printed notices which said there was no disease in the town, and saying that the doctors who said that there was disease did not know what they were talking about. 
 
 Sunderland was a big trading port at the time. It was the first British town to be affected by 'Indian cholera' epidemic. < ref > ''Diary of an Epidemic (Cholera)'', [[BBC Radio 4]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/longview/longview_20030415.shtml BBC - Radio 4 The Long View - Cholera outbreak in 19th Century Britain.] < /ref >  The first victim, William Sproat, died on 23 October 1831. Sunderland was put under [[wikit:quarantine|quarantine]], so that people could not leave the town. The port was blockaded, so that ships could not spread the disease to other ports. But in December of that year, cholera was in [[Gateshead]] and it spread across the country, killing about 32,000 people. 
 
 [[Jack Crawford (sailor)|Jack Crawford]] was one of the first to die in the epidemic. There are two statues honouring Jack, one in Mowbray Park near the Civic Centre, and the other next to Holy Trinity Church. 
 
 Sunderland got its first [[Member of Parliament]] after the Reform Act of 1832, and the Borough of Sunderland was created in 1836, although impatient citizens elected Andrew White to be Mayor in December 1835. 
 
 Robert Rawlinson was sent to Sunderland in February 1850 by the [[Public Health Act 1848|General Board of Health]]. His report showed the problems because there was no sewage system or drains. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2023|title=Sunderland and the Public Health Act|url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/towns/tyne-and-wear-case-study/about-the-group/public-administration/sunderland-and-the-public-health-act/|access-date=9 July 2023|website=UK Parliament}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Bridges ==== 
 [[File:Wearmouth bridge.jpg|thumb|The Wearmouth Bridge]] 
 The river at Sunderland is in a narrow valley, and the town grew up on [[plateau]]s high above the river. This meant it never had the problem of allowing people to cross the river without stopping high masted vessels. Rowland Burdon [[Member of Parliament|MP]] pushed for the [[Wearmouth Bridge]], which was built in 1796. It was the second iron bridge ever built. Only the famous [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] itself is older, but Wearmouth bridge was over twice as long and only three-quarters the weight of the Iron Bridge. Wearmouth Bridge was the biggest single span bridge in the world. < ref > {{cite web | work=Wearside Onliine | title=Sunderland Wearmouth Bridge | url=http://www.wearsideonline.com/Sunderland_Wearmouth_Bridge.html | accessdate=24 September 2006 | archive-date=27 November 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127114349/http://www.wearsideonline.com/sunderland_wearmouth_bridge.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Farther up the river, another bridge, the [[Queen Alexandra Bridge]], was built in 1910, linking the areas of [[Pallion]] and [[Southwick, Sunderland|Southwick]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=SINE Project: Structure details for Queen Alexandra Bridge|work=University of Newcastle upon Tyne|url=http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=1242|accessdate=12 October 2006|archive-date=25 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125023527/http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=1242|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It was designed for trains to run across, too, but the railway section was never completed. 
 
 ==== Victoria Hall Disaster ==== 
 The Victoria Hall was a large [[concert hall]] on Toward Road facing [[Mowbray Park]]. On 16 June 1883, 183 children died. < ref name= " vic " > {{cite web|title=Sunderland's Victoria Hall Stampede|url=http://www.north-country.co.uk/victoria.htm|work=North Country Web|accessdate=27 January 2007|archive-date=8 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108182434/http://www.north-country.co.uk/victoria.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  During a [[variety show]], children rushed down the stairs for treats. < ref > {{cite web|title=Victims of the Victoria Hall Calamity|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DUR/Sunderland/VictoriaHall.html|work=Genuki|accessdate=27 January 2007}} < /ref >  At the bottom of the staircase, the door only opened inward and was bolted so that only one child at a time could get through. < ref name= " vic2 " > {{cite web |title=The Victoria Hall Disaster 1883 |url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/libraries/Leaflets/Victorian%20Hall%20Disaster.pdf |work=City of Sunderland Library |accessdate=27 January 2007 |archive-date=11 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711002529/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/libraries/Leaflets/Victorian%20Hall%20Disaster.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The children pushed down the stairs to the door. Those at the front were trapped, and were crushed by the weight of the crowd behind them. 
 
 The Victoria Hall disaster is still the worst of its kind in Britain. < ref name= " bbc " > {{cite web|title=The Victoria Hall Disaster of 1883|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A882173|work=BBC h2g2|accessdate=26 May 2007}} < /ref >  A memorial statue, which is a crying mother holding a dead child, is now back in Mowbray Park with a protective canopy. < ref > {{cite news |title=Toy Tragedy Children Honoured|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1925815.stm|work=BBC News|date=2002-05-12 |accessdate=27 January 2007}} < /ref >  The newspaper reports of the tragedy were so shocking that an inquiry was set up. This committee said that public buildings should have outward opening [[emergency exit]]s. This led to the invention of 'push bar' emergency doors. This law still remains in full force to this day. The Victoria Hall was used until 1941 when it was destroyed by a [[Nazi Germany|German]] bomb. < ref > {{cite book| last = Talbot| first = Bryan| authorlink = Bryan Talbot| title = Alice in Sunderland: An Entertainment| year = 2007| publisher = Jonathon Cape| location = London| isbn = 978-0-224-08076-7| pages = 58–60 }} < /ref > 
 
 === 20th century to present === 
 As the traditional industries have declined, electronics, chemicals, and paper making have replaced them. Some of these new industries, are in [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], which has more space to allow purpose built factories. The Nissan car plant and the nearby North East Aircraft Museum are on the site of the old Sunderland Airport. 
 
 [[File:Sunderland.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Sunderland - taken from Tunstall Hill, August 1989]] 
 
 Since 1990, industries along the banks of the Wear have changed a lot. Housing, shopping parks and business centres have been built where the shipbuilding yards were. The [[National Glass Centre]] is also there, next to the [[University of Sunderland]]’s new  " St Peter’s Campus " . On the south side of the river, the old Vaux Brewery site has been cleared so that new houses, shops and offices can be built close to the city centre. 
 
 Sunderland was the one of the most heavily bombed areas in England during World War II. < ref > {{cite news|title=Rare images recall wartime blitz|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/4434123.stm|accessdate=18 January 2007}} < /ref >  As a result, much of the town centre was rebuilt in a boring concrete style. But some fine old buildings remain. These include [[Holy Trinity, Sunderland|Holy Trinity]], built in 1719 for an independent Sunderland, St. Michaels's Church, built as Bishopwearmouth Parish Church and now known as Sunderland Minster and St. Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth, part of which dates from 674 & nbsp;AD, and was the original monastery. 
 St. Andrew's Roker, so-called  " Cathedral of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] " , contains work by [[William Morris]], [[Ernest Gimson]] and [[Eric Gill]]. 
 
 === Civic history === 
 [[File:Sunderlandciviccentre2.jpg|thumb|200px|Sunderland Civic Centre (right background) with Mowbray Park to the left]] 
 Sunderland was made a [[municipal borough]] of [[County Durham]] in 1835. Under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], it was given further status as a county borough with independence from [[county council]] control. In 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the county borough was abolished and its area combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear. See [[City of Sunderland]]. 
 
 === Motto === 
 Sunderland has the motto of '''Nil Desperandum Auspice Deo'''. This means '''Never Despair, Trust In God''' 
 
 == Geography == 
 Much of the city is on a low range of hills running parallel to the coast. On average, it is around 80 & nbsp;metres above sea level. Sunderland is divided by the River Wear which passes through the middle of the city in a deep valley, part of which is known as the Hylton gorge. The only two road bridges connecting the north and south halves of the City are the Queen Alexandra Bridge at Pallion and the Wearmouth Bridge just to the north of the City centre. A third bridge carries the A19 trunk road over the Wear to the West of the City. 
 
 Most of the suburbs of Sunderland are west of the city centre with 70% of its population living on the south side of the river and 30% on the north side. The city extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope (on the south) and [[Seaburn]] (on the north). 
 {{See also|List of places in Sunderland}} 
 
 The area is part of the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Diocese of Durham]]. It has been in the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle]] since the Catholic bishops returned in 1850. 
 
 === Alphabetical street naming of suburbs === 
 Some Sunderland suburbs have most streets beginning with the same letter: 
 * '''A''': [[Farringdon, Sunderland|Farringdon]] 
 * '''B''': [[Town End Farm]] 
 * '''C''': [[Hylton Castle]] 
 * '''D''': [[Seaburn]] (some parts) 
 * '''E''': [[Carley Hill]] 
 * '''F''': [[Ford Estate]] 
 * '''G''': [[Grindon, Sunderland|Grindon]] 
 * '''H''': [[Hylton Lane]] 
 * '''K''': [[Downhill, Sunderland|Downhill]] 
 * '''M''': [[Moorside]] 
 * '''P''': [[Pennywell]] and [[Plains Farm]] 
 * '''R''': [[Redhouse, Sunderland|Red House]] 
 * '''S''': [[Springwell, Sunderland|Springwell]] 
 * '''T''': [[Thorney Close]] 
 * '''W''': [[Witherwack]] 
 
 === Climate === 
 Sunderland has cool winters and warm summers. Being on the coast, Sunderland is a little warmer in the winter than the national average, but a little cooler in summer. Average rainfall is below the UK national average due to an east coast location. 
 
 As with most UK east-coast towns, Sunderland sometimes gets sea [[fog]] known locally as ''Fret''. This is most common in the summer months (April - September). These frets can be very dense, are often very localised, and can appear and disappear in a matter of minutes.

 Only 114 people of [[Judaism|Jewish]] faith live in Sunderland. There was no Jewish community before 1750, but then a number of Jewish businessmen from across the UK and Europe settled in Sunderland. A [[Rabbi]] from [[Holland]] was working in the city in 1790. The Jewish community has been shrinking since the mid 20th century. Many Sunderland Jews left for bigger Jewish communities in Britain or to Israel. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.999sunderland.com/|title=502 Bad Gateway|website=www.999sunderland.com|access-date=2019-02-11|archive-date=2020-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807155300/http://www.999sunderland.com/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The Jewish primary school, the Menorah School, closed in July 1983.

 Sunderland does not have a big music venue such as the [[MetroRadio Arena]] or the [[Carling Academy Newcastle|Carling Academy]] in Newcastle. The Empire Theatre sometimes plays host to music acts, and has attracted [[Deacon Blue]] and [[Journey South]] to the city in recent years. [[McFly (band)|McFly]] played there in April 2007. In the past it has also welcomed major bands such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Kinks]]. 
 
 ''Independent'', a city centre [[nightclub]]/music venue, satisfies underground music lovers, having previously played host to [[Keane]], Franz Ferdinand, [[Kasabian]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Maxïmo Park]] and [[Snow Patrol]] when they were largely unknown. More recently, [[Doves (band)|Doves]] and [[Tim Burgess]] have performed DJ sets on club nights, and in summer 2007 the club hosted gigs from established bands such as [[The Zutons]] and [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]]. The [[Manor Quay]], the students' union on the campus of the University of Sunderland has also hosted the [[Arctic Monkeys]], Maxïmo Park, 911, [[the Levellers (band)|the Levellers]] and [[Girls Aloud]] in the past three years.

 Sunderland is one of the most deprived cities in the [[Northern England|North of England]]. 11 of the 25 [[ward (politics)|wards]] featuring in the list of the 2000 most deprived wards in England. < ref name= " eCity " > {{cite web|title=Sunderland's Economy|work=Sunderland City Council|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/projects/Pathfinder/e-city/why/economy.asp|accessdate=18 January 2007|archive-date=31 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231221012/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/projects/Pathfinder/e-city/why/economy.asp|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The most deprived areas are Southwick to the north of the river and Thorney Close to the south - both with chronic levels of unemployment, although the city is performing better than the North East as a whole. < ref name= " eCity "  / >

 Once called the  " Greatest Shipbuilding Town in the World " , < ref > {{cite web|title=History of Shipbuilding in the North East|work=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/ship-building/background.shtml|accessdate=18 January 2007}} < /ref >  ships were built on the Wear from at least 1346 onwards. The Port of Sunderland was expanded in the 1850s when the Hudsons Dock were built for the River Wear Commissioners. [[Robert Stephenson]] helped the engineers. < ref > {{cite web|title=SINE Project: Structure details for South Dock: Hudson Dock|work=University of Newcastle upon Tyne|url=http://www.sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=505|accessdate=22 November 2006|archive-date=16 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616184050/http://www.sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=505|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 Competition from overseas caused a downturn in demand for Sunderland built ships toward the end of the twentieth century. The last shipyard in Sunderland closed in 1988. 
 
 Sunderland, part of the Durham coalfield, has a coal-mining heritage that dates back centuries. At the peak in 1923, 170,000 miners were employed in County Durham alone, < ref > {{cite web|title=Rise and Fall of Coal Mining|work=North East England History|url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/CoalMiningandRailways.htm|accessdate=18 January 2007|archive-date=24 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224015756/http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/CoalMiningandRailways.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  as labourers from all over Britain, including many from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], entered the region. As demand for coal fell after World War II, mines began to close across the region, causing mass unemployment. The last coal mine closed in 1994. The site of the last coal mine, Wearmouth Colliery, is now the Stadium of Light, and a miner's Stephenson lamp monument stands outside of the ground to honour the heritage of the site. 
 
 Glass has been made in Sunderland for around 1,500 years. But overseas competition has forced the closure of all of Sunderland's glass-making factories. [[Corning Glass Works]] was one of the last. It was in Sunderland for 120 years, until 31 March 2007 < ref > {{cite web

 [[Vaux Breweries]] was established in the town centre in the 1880s and for 110 years was a major employer. The brewery was finally closed in July 1999. Vaux in Sunderland and [[Wards Brewing Company]] in [[Sheffield]] had been part of the Vaux Group, when both breweries closed the group started to concentrate on its hotels which were in The Swallow Group. In the autumn of 2000 even this was taken over by [[Whitbread|Whitbread PLC]]. 
 
 === Rejuvenation === 
 [[File:Echo 24.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Echo 24 apartment building, built on the site of derelict riverfront warehouses]] 
 Sunderland's economy began to get better after the 1980s. 
 
 The giant [[NMUK|Nissan factory]] moved in, and new [[Service industry|service industries]] arrived. [[Doxford International Business Park]], in the south west of the city, has attracted a host of national and international companies. 
 
 The former shipyard areas along the River Wear have also been transformed. Instead of the old industry new developments have been built, including: 
 * St. Peter's Campus of the University of Sunderland; 
 * North Haven, executive housing and marina at the old North Dock at Roker; 
 * the National Glass Centre, by St. Peter's Church; 
 * the Stadium of Light the 49,000-capacity home of Sunderland A.F.C.; 
 * Hylton Riverside Retail Park, a large shopping outlet centre at [[Castletown, Sunderland|Castletown]]. 
 * Echo 24 luxury apartments near the city centre. 
 
 Sunderland Corporation's massive post-war housing estate developments, such as Farringdon, Pennywell, Grindon, Hylton Red House, [[Hylton Castle]], Thorney Close and Town End Farm, together with earlier developments, have all passed into the ownership of Gentoo (once called Sunderland Housing Group), a private company and a  " Registered Social Landlord " . Since the transfer in 2000 there have been a lot of improvements to the quality of social housing in the city. 
 
 The [[central business district]] of Sunderland has also been redeveloped and improved. In 2000, The Bridges [[shopping mall|shopping centre]] was extended to attract national [[chain store]]s. In November 2004, after several years with no cinema, a [[Cineworld]] multiplex opened in the new River Quarter, an entertainment complex towards the east of the City Centre. The Cinema was taken over by the Empire Multiplex Cinema Company in mid 2006. The previous ABC Cinema, situated on the corner of Park Lane and Holmeside, had been derelict for a number of years until it reopened late in 2005 as The Point, with three bars and the Union nightclub. 
 
 The arrival of [[Roy Keane]] as [[Sunderland AFC]]'s new manager in August 2006 has had a massive impact in Sunderland's once limited tourism industry. Keane has proved a big pull for the city in terms of attracting tourists to Sunderland, with the Tourism Office reporting a dramatic rise in the number of football fans coming to the city  " mentioning his name " < ref name= " Keane " > {{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6032905.stm|title=Keane triggers city tourist boom|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 February 2007}} < /ref >  as early as October 2006, just six weeks after Keane's appointment as manager. Airline [[Ryanair]], moreover, recorded a 10% increase in passenger numbers travelling to [[Newcastle Airport]] on Fridays before a Sunderland home game, some 600 more than on other Fridays. The Tourism Office believes Keane's attachment to the city is causing a knock-on effect on local restaurants, bars and attractions in that more tourists are  " making a weekend of it " < ref name= " Keane "  / >  after watching the football.

 === Metro === 
 In 2002, the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] system was extended to Sunderland. The local Metro ends at [[South Hylton]] after calling at Sunderland Rail Station and Park Lane Bus Station. Metro trains are quite frequent and travel between [[Newcastle International Airport]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in the north and South Hylton at the southern end of the line. However, the Metro extension has not been viewed as a huge success with frequency of services cut due to a lack of demand. 
 
 === Bus === 
 A multimillion-pound [[transport]] [[interchange]] at [[Park Lane Interchange|Park Lane]] was opened on 2 May 1999 by the then ''[[Brookside]]'' actor Michael Starke. With 750,000 passengers per year it is the busiest bus and coach station in Britain after [[Victoria Station]] in Central [[London]], < ref name= " didyouknow " > {{cite news|title=Did you know?

A new Metro station was built underneath the bus concourse to provide a direct interchange as part of the extension to South Hylton in 2002. 
 
 === Cycle === 
 There are a number of cycle routes that run through and around Sunderland. The [[National Cycle Network]] National Route 1 runs from Ryhope in the south, through the centre of the city, and then along the coast towards South Shields. Britain's most popular long distance [[Bicycle|cycle]] [[route]] - The 'C2C' [[Sea to Sea Cycle Route]] - traditionally starts (or ends) when the cyclist dips their wheel in the sea on Roker beach. The '[[W2W]]' 'Wear-to-[[Walney]]' route, and the 'Two-Rivers' (Tyne and Wear) route also end in Sunderland.
