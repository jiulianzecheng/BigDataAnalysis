A '''magnetar''' is a type of [[neutron star]] with an extremely powerful [[magnetic field]].

 It is known as the largest and the most powerful type of [[magnet]] existing in the [[Universe]].  It has the most powerful [[magnetic field]] at 10 < sup > 15 < /sup >  [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]].  The theory regarding these objects was proposed by [[Robert Duncan]] and [[Christopher Thompson]] in 1992, but the first recorded [[gamma ray burst]] thought to have been from a magnetar had been detected on March 5, 1979.  Magnetars were previously named as Anomalous [[X-ray]] [[Pulsar]] < nowiki/ > s ('''AXP'''s).
