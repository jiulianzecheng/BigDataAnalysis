 A '''cantaloupe''' (also known as a '''rockmelon''', '''sweet melon''', or '''spanspek''') is a type of [[fruit]]. It is a [[muskmelon]] that is probably related to the [[watermelon]]. There are two types of cantaloupe, [[Europe]]an and [[North America]]n. Cantaloupes range in size from 0.5 to 5.0 kilograms (1.1 to 11 & nbsp;lb). 
 == Types of cantaloupe == 
 * The European cantaloupe is [[oblong]] with a light [[green]] skin. 
 * The North American cantaloupe is [[round]] with a thin light [[brown]] [[skin]]. The [[flesh]] of the fruit is firm, [[Orange (color)|orange]] and [[Sweet (taste)|sweet]].

 Cantaloupes are a source of [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s. These are chemicals which were thought to provide certain health benefits to the [[cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] and [[immune system]]s by regulating the formation of [[nitric oxide]]. Nitric oxide is a key chemical in promoting health of the [[endothelium]] and prevention of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]]. However, recent research has indicated they do not benefit the body. The body already has ways to deal with [[oxidation]]. 
 
 Cantaloupes also are an excellent source of [[vitamin C]]. 
 
 Dirty cantaloupes can spread [[bacteria]]. In 2011, 21 people died in the [[United States]] from cantaloupes having ''[[listeria]]'' bacteria. The bad cantaloupes were traced back from around the country to a single farm in Colorado. < ref > [https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cantaloupes-jensen-farms/index.html Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis Linked to Whole Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms, Colorado] < /ref >
