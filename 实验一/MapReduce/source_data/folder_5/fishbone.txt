 '''Fishbone''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in 1979 in Los Angeles, which plays a fusion of [[ska music|ska]], [[punk rock]], [[funk music|funk]], and other musical styles. Critics considered Fishbone to be one of the most distinctive and varied bands of the late '80s. With their hyperactive, self-conscious [[diversity]], goofy sense of humor, and sharp [[social commentary]], the group gained a large [[cult following]] during the late '80s, yet they never became mainstream.
