[[File:Knowth Gesamtansicht.jpg|thumb|Main tomb of Knowth]] 
 '''Knowth''' is the name given to a number of [[passage grave]]s, in the [[Boyne valley]] in [[Ireland]]. It consists of a bigger [[tumulus]] with two passages, and of 20 smaller ones. Of the smaller graves, 17 remain, 3 have been destroyed. Knowth is approximately 1 & nbsp;km west of [[Newgrange]]. It is probably older than Newgrange, which has been dated to about 3.150 [[BCE]], but not as old as [[Dowth]].  The main tumulus is one of the biggest to be found in Ireland.
