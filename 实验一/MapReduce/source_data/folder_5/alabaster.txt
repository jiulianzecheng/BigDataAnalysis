 '''Alabaster''' is a name applied to varieties of two distinct [[mineral]]s. [[Gypsum]] is a [[hydroxy|hydrous]] [[sulfur|sulfate]] of [[calcium]], and [[calcite]] is a [[carbonate]] of calcium. Gypsum is the alabaster of the present day; calcite is generally the alabaster of the ancients. Both are easy to work. They are attractive to look at. Both have been used for making a variety of artworks and objects, especially small carvings. 
 
 The two kinds are easy to tell apart. One is harder than the other. Calcite is hard ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 3). Gypsum is soft ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 1.5 to 2). It can be easily scratched by a fingernail. Also, calcite [[Effervescence|effervesces]] when it is treated with [[hydrochloric acid]]. Gypsum does not.
