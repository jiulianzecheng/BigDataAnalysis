 '''Capella''' (α Aurigae, α Aur, [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Aurigae) is the brightest star in the [[constellation]] [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], the eleventh brightest star in the night sky and the third brightest star in the northern [[Celestial sphere|celestial hemisphere]], after [[Arcturus]] and [[Vega]]. 
 
 Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, it is actually a [[star system]] of four stars in two [[binary star|binary pair]]s.  The first pair consists of two bright, large [[Stellar classification|type-G]] [[giant star]]s, both with a radius about 10 times the Sun's, in close orbit around each other.  These two stars are thought to be cooling and expanding on their way to becoming [[red giant]]s. 
 
 The second pair, around 10,000 [[astronomical unit]]s from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool [[red dwarf]]s. < ref > Kaler, James B. 2002.
