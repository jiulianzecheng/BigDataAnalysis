 '''Anglicisation''' or '''anglicization''' is the act of changing of spoken or [[Writing|written]] [[wikt:element|elements]] of another [[language]] into a form that can more easily be understood by an [[English language|English]] speaker. 
 
 For instance, the [[Italian language|Italian]] name of the city of [[Rome]], the capital of [[Italy]], is ''{{lang|it|Roma}}''. English speakers call it  " Rome "  to make it [[Hearing|sound]] more English. Another example is the city of [[Moscow]] in [[Russia]], which sounds like ''Moskva'' in [[Russian language|Russian]], though it is written much differently because Russian uses the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] (it is written in that language as {{lang|ru|Москва}}). Still, English speakers call the city  " Moscow "  because it is easier to say. 
 
 Most of these changes were made a few [[century|centuries]] ago. In some cases the original language was different to the modern one. [[Turin]] in the [[Piedmont]] province of Italy was called ''{{lang|pms|Turin}}'' in Piedmontese, the native language of the region, but is now officially known as ''{{lang|it|Torino}}'' after its Italian name. The English and [[French language|French]] name for [[Florence]], also in Italy, is closer to the original name in [[Latin]] (''{{lang|la|Florentia}}'') than is the modern Italian name of ''{{lang|it|Firenze}}''. 
 
 Anglicization has both a [[politics|political]] and [[culture|cultural]] dimension. Most [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] place names were once anglicized when they were under [[England|English]] rule. Now that they have [[Devolution|their own local parliaments]], they changed the official names back again. In [[Scotland]], however, few people speak Gaelic, so in most places the English versions are almost always used. On the other hand, in [[Wales]], where there are plenty of Welsh speaking people, all [[road sign]]s need to be in both English and Welsh.
