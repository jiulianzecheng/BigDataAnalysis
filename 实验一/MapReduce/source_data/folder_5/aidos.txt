'''Aidos''' ({{lang-grc|Αἰδώς}}) was the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[shame]], [[modesty]] and [[humility]]. She was a close friend of the goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. < ref > [[Hesiod]], ''Works and Days'', 170 ff < /ref >  One source calls her the daughter of [[Prometheus]]. < ref > [[Pindar]], Olympian Ode 7. 44 ff < /ref > 
 
 Aidos is often considered to be more of a [[personification]] than a physical goddess. She was said to be the [[feeling]] of [[reverence]] that stops men from doing bad things. She was also said to be a feeling of shame that a rich person might get when they saw poor people. 
 
 She is spoken about in some early [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Greek plays]], such as ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' by [[Aeschylus]], ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'' by [[Euripides]], and ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' by [[Sophocles]]. 
 
 There were [[altar]]s to Aidos in [[Athens]] < ref > [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 1. 17. 1 < /ref >  and in [[Lacedaemon]]. < ref > [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 3. 20. 10 - 11 < /ref >
