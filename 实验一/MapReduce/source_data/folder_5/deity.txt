 A '''deity''' is thought to be a powerful [[spirit]] that controls events and the [[nature]] of things. Deities are also called '''gods'''. A female god is often called a '''goddess'''. The [[adjective]] of deity is ‘[[divine]]’. This word comes from the [[Latin]] ''deus'' (female: ''dea''). 
 
 Different religions believe in different deities. Since there are many religions in the [[world]] there are many different ideas about how many deities there are, what they are, and what they can do.  < ref > [http://atheism.wikia.com/wiki/How_many_gods How many gods] < /ref >  Followers of many ancient religions and some modern religions believe in many deities, which is called [[polytheism]].  
 
 The two largest religions on earth, [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], believe in only one [[God]], which is called [[monotheism]]. [[Deism]] is the belief that a deity exists, but that the deity does not very often change or never changes things in the [[universe]]. [[Pantheism]] is the belief that the universe is the deity, while [[atheism]] is the belief that there are no deities. 
 
 In most religions, believers think deities are [[immortal]] (cannot die), and have powers far beyond human powers.
