'''Esperantido''' is a term used for languages derivatives of [[Esperanto]] and a [[constructed language]] for describing a language project based on or inspired by [[Esperanto]].  
 
 The creator of the [[Esperanto]] was the [[eye doctor]] [[L. L. Zamenhof]] in [[1887]]. He proposed reform in [[1894]] with several changes, and considered it  " Reformed Esperanto " . 
 
 The most popular project of Esperantido is the [[Ido]], but it is far less popular than the original [[Esperanto]], which continues to be the world's most popular [[constructed language]] of all universal language projects.
