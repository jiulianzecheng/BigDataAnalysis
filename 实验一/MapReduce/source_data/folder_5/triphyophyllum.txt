 '''''Triphyophyllum''''' is a [[carnivorous plant]] [[genus]] with only one [[species]]  '''''Triphyophyllum peltatum'''''. It is [[native]] to tropical western [[Africa]], in [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]], growing in [[tropical rainforest]]s.  
 
 It is a [[liana]], with a three-stage lifecycle, each with a different shaped [[leaf]], as indicated by its [[Greek language|Greek]] name. In the first stage, ''T. peltatum'' has simple lance-like leaves, and looks nondescript. It then develops long, glandular leaves, like those of the related ''[[Drosophyllum]]''. These sticky leaves capture insects. The plant then enters its adult liana form, with short non-carnivorous leaves on a long twining stem.  
 
 ''T. peltatum'' is cultivated in only three botanical gardens: [[Abidjan]], [[Bonn]], and [[WÃ¼rzburg]]. It is extremely rare in private collections.
