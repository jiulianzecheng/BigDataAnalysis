 '''Eusociality''' is a term in [[animal behaviour]] for the more complex kinds of social organisation. The term  " eusocial "  was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra. < ref > Batra S.W.T. 1966. Nests and social behavior of halictine bees of India (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). ''Indian J. Entomol'' '''28''' 375-393. < /ref >  [[E.O. Wilson]] gave it a more precise meaning. < ref > Wilson E.O. 1971. The insect societies. ''Harvard University Press''. Cambridge. Massachusetts. < /ref > 
 
 == Meaning of the term == 
 At the start, it was used for [[invertebrate]]s only, usually social insects. These are its main features: < ref > Michener C.D. 1969. ''Ann. Rev. Entomol''. '''14''', 299-342. < /ref > < ref > Gadagkar, Raghavendra 1993. And now... eusocial thrips!. ''Current Science'' '''64'''(4) 215-216.

 # Different animals have different jobs to do. There is a [[division of labour]]. Some [[caste (biology)|castes]] may be [[sterile]]. 
 # Animal generations overlap. There are different generations in the [[hive]] or nest. 
 # Animals cooperate to care for the young. 
 
 [[Presociality]] is a term for simpler ([[basal]]) kinds of sociality.

 == Examples == 
 The most familiar examples of eusociality are [[insects]] such as [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s, and [[termite]]s. All of these are [[Colony (biology)|colonial]] animals which have queens for [[reproduction]]. The animals that are workers or soldiers are usually [[infertility|sterile]] - they cannot have [[offspring]]. 
 
 There were only two known [[mammal]] [[species]] which are eusocial. These are the [[Naked Mole Rat|naked mole rat]] and the Damaraland mole rat. < ref > Burda H. Honeycutt R.L. Begall S. Locker-Grutjen O  &  Scharff A. 2000. Are naked and common mole-rats eusocial and if so, why? ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''47''' 293-303 [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=1456956 Abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120855/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=1456956 |date=2016-03-04 }} < /ref > 
 
 Eusociality with sterile [[individual]]s is the most extreme form of [[kin altruism]]. They do specialized tasks, often caring for the reproductive members. It includes individuals whose behaviour, body shape and function is modified for group defence, including self-sacrifice ([[altruism]]). 
 
 Eusociality played a key role in the development of theories in [[sociobiology]]. 
 
 === Naked mole rat === 
 [[File:Nacktmull.jpg|thumb|Naked mole rat (''Heterocephalus glaber'') one of very few eusocial mammals]] 
 
 [[Naked mole rat]]s are eusocial [[mammals]]. [[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] averaging 75-80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid [[African]] [[deserts]]. The tunnel systems built by naked mole rats can stretch up to two or three miles in cumulative length. < ref name=selfish_gene > {{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|year=1976|title=The Selfish Gene|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-286092-5}} < /ref > 
 
 === Other examples === 
 Recently, some species of gall-making [[aphid]]s (Order [[Hemiptera]]) and thrips (Order [[Thysanoptera]]) are eusocial, with many separate origins of the state ([[convergent evolution]]). These species have extremely high relatedness between individuals. This is due to their mode of reproduction: sterile soldier castes are of the same clone as the reproducing female. The gall-inhabiting behavior gives these species a resource which sets them apart from related species with similar genetics. In these groups, therefore, high relatedness alone does not lead to the evolution of social behavior, but requires that groups occur in a restricted, shared area. < ref > Crespi B.J. 1992 Eusociality in Australian gall thrips. ''Nature'' '''359''': 724-726. < /ref > 
 
 Similarly, eusociality occurs in some [[crustacean]]s and other [[arthropod]]s. On some tropical reefs, several species of minute ''Synalpheus'' [[pistol shrimp]] are eusocial. They depend on certain sponges for the survival of their colony, < ref > {{cite journal|title=Multiple origins of eusociality among sponge-dwelling shrimps (Synalpheus)|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_evolution_2000-04_54_2/page/503|journal=Evolution|volume=54|issue=2|year=2000|pages=503–516|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00053.x|pmid=10937227|s2cid=1088840|last1=Duffy|first1=J. Emmett|last2=Morrison|first2=Cheryl L.|last3=Rí;os|first3=Rubé;n}} < /ref >  and have a single breeding female and a number of male defenders armed with large snapping claws. Again, there is a single shared domicile for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it. < ref > {{cite journal|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|title=On the frequency of eusociality in snapping shrimps (Decapoda : Alpheidae), with description of a second eusocial species|author=Duffy, J.

 == Theories of social evolution == 
 In colonies of eusocial animals, some animals are sterile. They can not pass on their [[genes]] at all. How can these animals [[evolve]] and persist? Since they do not breed, their [[fitness]] should be zero and any [[gene]]s causing this condition should be eliminated from the population immediately. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', Darwin called this eusocial behavior the  " one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my theory " . < ref > Darwin, Charles 1859. ''The origin of species''. London:Murray. Chapter 7, p236 < /ref > < ref > Costa, James T. 2009. ''The annotated origin''. Harvard, p236. < /ref >  Darwin thought that the resolution to the paradox would lie in the close family relationship. 
 
 Darwin could not say more because he did no know what the mechanism of [[heredity]] was. The first explanations were [[kin selection]], and [[inclusive fitness]]. Both rely on the discovery of how genes are [[Heredity|inherited]]. This discovery was made after Darwin had published ''On the Origin of Species'', and not understood until after 1900. 
 
 Early ideas on eusociality included suggestions that [[trophallaxis]] or food sharing was a basis for sociality. < ref > Wheeler W.M. 1918. A study of some ant larvae with a consideration of the origin and meaning of social habits among insects. ''Proc. Am. Phil. Soc''. '''57''', 293-343. < /ref >  The most widely accepted model to explain eusociality is based on [[W.D. Hamilton]]'s idea of [[inclusive fitness]]. < ref > Hamilton, William D. 1996. ''Narrow roads of geneland''. Freeman. Chapter 2, Hamilton's rule pp 14{{ndash}}30. < /ref > 
 
 === Inclusive fitness === 
 Haplodiploidy determines the sex in ''all'' members of the insect order [[Hymenoptera]] ([[bee]]s, [[ant]]s, and [[wasp]]s), and the [[Thysanoptera]] ('thrips'). < ref name=Grimaldi > Grimaldi D. and Engel M.S. 2005. ''The evolution of the insects''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-82149-5}} < /ref > < sup > p408 < /sup > 
 
 In this system, sex is determined by the number of sets of [[chromosome]]s an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a [[sperm]] and an [[egg (biology)|egg]] develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and so are [[haploid]]. 
 
 The haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. Most importantly, the [[relatedness]] between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive or nest is 0.75. This means the workers are significantly more closely related than siblings in other sex determination systems. < ref > The relatedness of siblings is usually 0.5. < /ref >  It is this point which drives the [[kin selection]] theory of how eusociality evolved. < ref name=Grimaldi/ > < sup > p465 < /sup > < ref name=Hamilton > Hamilton W.D. 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour, I and II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' '''7''', 1–52. Reprinted with comments in Hamilton W.D. 1996. ''Narrow roads of geneland'', volume I ''Evolution of social behaviour''. Freeman/Spektrum, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-7167-4530-5}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal| author = Hughes W.O.H. |display-authors = etal | title = Ancestral monogamy shows kin selection is key to the evolution of eusociality| journal = Science| volume = 320| issue = 5880| pages = 1213–1216| date = 2008| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/320/5880/1213| accessdate = 2008-08-04| doi = 10.1126/science.1156108| pmid = 18511689|s2cid = 20388889 }}

 === Consequences === 
 If the theory of inclusive fitness is accurate, the [[haplodiploidy]] makes kin selection easier. ''Sisters are more related to each other than to any offspring they might have''. Hamilton called them ''supersisters''. On average, two supersisters have 75 percent of the same genes. If they  breed, they would share only half of their genome with their offspring. From the [[selfish gene]]'s point-of-view, it is better to raise more sisters. Even though workers often do not reproduce, they are potentially passing on more of their genes by caring for sisters than they would by having their own offspring. 
 
 This unusual situation may explain why eusociality evolved several times in the haplodiploid group Hymenoptera — [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s. As of 2009, 11 separate cases are known. However, Hymenoptera is a large group and the majority of its species are not social. Furthermore, highly developed eusociality also exists in non-hymenopterans, perhaps most obviously in [[termites]]. Most such cases involve organisms that display high levels of [[inbreeding]], so that colony members share more than half of their genes. Therefore the same model is considered to apply to these species. 
 
 Reeve and Holldobler put forward a theory of a superorganism. < ref > Reeve H.K. and Hölldobler B. 2007. The emergence of a superorganism through intergroup competition. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' '''104''': 9736-9740 < /ref >  They look at competition and co-operation ''between'' groups as well as ''within'' groups. In their model, an individual's inclusive fitness varies according to how much it invests in within-group competition (e.g. hoarding a private food cache) versus between-group competition (e.g. contributing to common foraging); and on its relatedness to the other group members. 
 
 In a colony with one breeder (queen) and many workers, the [[evolutionarily stable state]] is for each individual to invest entirely in helping the group. This leads to a perfect  " superorganism " . In other words, the eusociality is stable, a result that agrees with Hamilton's findings. Also, they show that the effect is reinforced if there are many groups competing for the same resources.
