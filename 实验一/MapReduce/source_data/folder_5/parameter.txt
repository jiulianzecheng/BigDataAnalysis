 In some non-technical [[context]]s or in [[jargon]], ''parameter'' may simply be a synonym for [[:wikt:criterion|criterion]]. 
 
 In [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], and the mathematical [[science]]s, '''parameters''' ([[Latin|L:]] ''auxiliary measure'') are quantities that define certain relatively constant characteristics of systems or [[mathematical function|function]]s. 
 
 Most commonly represented  & theta; in general form, other symbols carry standard, specific meanings.  When evaluating the function over a [[domain]] or determining the response of the system over a period of time, the [[independent variable]]s are modulated, while the parameters are held constant.  The function or system may then be reevaluated or reprocessed with different parameters, to give a function or system with different behavior. 
 
 Loosely speaking, the term '''parameter''' is used for an argument which is intermediate in status between a [[variable]] and a [[constant]]. 
 
 ==Example== 
 * In a section on frequently misused words in his book ''The Writer's Art'', ''James J. Kilpatrick'' quoted a letter from a correspondent, giving examples to illustrate the correct use of the word ''parameter'': 
 
 {{cquote|W.M. Woods...a mathematician...writes...  " ...a variable is one of the many things a ''parameter'' is not. "  ... The dependent variable, the speed of the car, depends on the independent variable, the position of the gas pedal.}} 
 {{cquote|[Kilpatrick quoting Woods]  " Now...the engineers...change the lever arms of the linkage...the speed of the car...will still depend on the pedal position...''but in a...different manner''.  You have changed a parameter " }} 
 
 * If asked to imagine the [[graph]] of the relationship  < math > y= a x^2 < /math > , one typically visualizes a range of values of ''x'', but only one value of ''a''. Of course a different value of ''a'' can be used, generating a different graphical appearance. The ''a'' can therefore be considered to be a parameter: less variable than the variable ''x'', but less constant than the constant ''2''. 
 * Suppose you want to buy a bike, and that you believe that the amount of money you are going to make next month is defined by the wage you receive per hour times the number of hours you are going to work (''y'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;''ax'')(Income=wage x hours that you work). You are able to influence the number of hours you work next month (your boss is very flexible), but you think that you will not be able to change the height of your wage (your boss is a real pain when it comes to discussing wages). Then: 
 **Your wage is the parameter 
 **The number of hours you work is the variable. 
 **This is of course depending on whether you think you can or cannot change your wage. 
 
 Suppose that you and a friend are both working for the same boss making the same money working the same hours, that the formula would become: 
 *(''y'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;''2ax'')(Income=2 x wage x hours that you work). 
 **the constant is 2 
 **the parameter is your wage 
 **the variable is the number of hours you are going to work 
 
 ===Engineering=== 
 In [[engineering]] (especially involving data acquisition) the term ''parameter'' sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. For example, an airliner [[flight data recorder]] may record 88 different items, each termed a parameter. This usage is not consistent, as sometimes the term ''channel'' refers to an individual measured item, with ''parameter'' referring to the setup information about that channel. 
 
 " Speaking generally, '''properties''' are those [[Physical quantity|physical quantities]] which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; '''parameters''' are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its [[reciprocal]]. "  John D. Trimmer, 1950, Response of Physical Systems (New York: Wiley), p. & nbsp;13. 
 
 The term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences. The data that one [[computer program]] gives to another are sometimes called parameters.
