 '''Omics''' is a  term used in modern [[genetics]]. It is used for terms which end in the suffix ''[[wikt:-omics|-omics]]'', such as [[genomics]]. 
   
 The [[suffix]] '''-ome''' is used for the objects of study, such as the [[genome]], [[proteome]] or [[metabolome]]. The ''-ome'' refers to a ''totality'' of some sort.  
 
 Functional genomics aims at identifying the functions of as many genes as possible of a given organism. < ref >  Holtorf, Hauke; Guitton, Marie-Christine; Reski, Ralf 2002.

 Many  " omes "  beyond the original  " genome "  have  been adopted by research scientists.  " Proteomics "  has become well-established as a term for studying proteins at a large scale. < ref >   " O M E S Page " . bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu.
