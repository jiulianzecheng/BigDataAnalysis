 The '''Amiidae''' are a family of basal [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]] in the order [[Amiiformes]]. The [[bowfin]] (''Amia calva'') and the [[eyespot bowfin]] (''Amia ocellicauda'') are the only two to survive today, but other than those, a vast majority of them went [[Extinction|extinct]]. 
 
 [[Bowfins]] are found throughout eastern [[North America]], typically in slow-moving backwaters, [[Canal|canals]], and [[Oxbow lake|oxbow lakes]]. Amiidae is an ancient group that has numerous synapomorphic characters. Amiidae were widespread and rich in species during the [[Eocene]] era.
