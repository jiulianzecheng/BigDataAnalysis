 '''Dyfed''' (pronounced ''Durv-ed'') is one of the eight [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved counties]] of [[Wales]]. 
 
 It was created on 1 April 1974 when [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]], [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Pembrokeshire]] came together. In 1996, it was abolished and Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire were made into seperate counties once again. The next day, Cardiganshire was renamed to its current name, [[Ceredigion]]. 
 
 It was a very rural county and was located in the south-west of Wales. It had a border on the [[Irish Sea]] and the [[Bristol Channel]]. It bordered [[Gwynedd]] to the north, [[Powys]] to the east and [[West Glamorgan]] to the south-east. 
 
 The county's [[county town]] was [[Carmarthen]] but the largest town was [[Llanelli]]. The university town of [[Aberystwyth]] was also inside the county. 
 
 The name Dyfed is still used today, for example in the name [[Dyfed–Powys Police]].
