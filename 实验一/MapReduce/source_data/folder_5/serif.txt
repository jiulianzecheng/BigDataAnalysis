 A '''serif''' is a term in [[typography]]. If a [[letter]] is made of a [[Line (geometry)|line]] or lines, a serif is a tiny decorative line on the ends of letter's 'limbs'. Thus, in the [[illustration]] on the right, each serif letter has a serif on the end of its lines. Alphabetic [[Typeface|typefaces]] either have serifs or not. Those without are called [[sans-serif]]. 
 
 The design of our typefaces started in the [[15th century]], when the early printers used moulds from which letters made of [[lead]] were produced. < ref name= " Nic " > Gray, Nicolete 1986. ''A history of lettering: creative experiment and letter identity'', p16, p25 and chapters 9 and 10. Oxford: Phaidon. < /ref > 
 
 However, the original source of the serif may be in monumental inscriptions. Serifs are on the letters at the base of [[Trajan]]'s column (built 107~113 [[AD]]), and are clearly illustrated in standard textbooks on typography. < ref name= " Nic "  / >  Indeed, older literature often describes typefaces with serifs as ''Roman''. The word ''serif'' seems to be an early [[19th century]] innovation. < ref > OED first mention of serif in 1830. < /ref >
