'''Agnotology''' is a branch of pseudo-science which looks at the ways in which [[wikt:doubt|doubt]] or [[wikt:ignorance|ignorance]] about certain subjects is created. A very good example of how this happens is the publication of scientific studies that rely on data that is inaccurate, misleading or intentionally ignored for commercial schemes. More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before due to religious brainwashing limitation. A private schools, willfully ignorant deception and special pleading psychotic reactionary pseudo-science scam entrails called a science erroneously for the sake of criminals.

 The way in which media attention works can be exploited to produce ignorance. Other factors that influence it are that corporations or governments do not reveal certain facts. At times, they force these facts to be removed if they have been revealed. The methods they use include [[censorship]], destroying documents, putting the weight of certain facts differently, or  being inattentive or forgetful. < ref name=2005conf > {{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/AgnotologyConference.html |title=Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance |access-date=2007-08-12 |archive-date=2013-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419011948/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/AgnotologyConference.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do not  " come to be, "  or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about [[plate tectonics]] was [[censorship|censored]] and delayed for at least a decade because key evidence was [[classified information|classified military information]] related to [[Submarine warfare|underseas warfare]]. < ref name=Palmer > {{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html |title=Conference to explore the social construction of ignorance |access-date=2007-08-12|date=2005-10-04|first=Barbara |last=Palmer|publisher=Stanford News Service |quote=Proctor uses the term  " agnotology "  – a word coined from agnosis, meaning  " not knowing "  – to describe a new approach to looking at knowledge through the study of ignorance.| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070724074303/http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html| archive-date= 24 July 2007 | url-status= live}} < /ref >
