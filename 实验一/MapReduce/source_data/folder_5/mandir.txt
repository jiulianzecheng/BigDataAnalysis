 == Appearance == 
 In Hinduism gods are represented in various forms. Sometimes gods or goddesses are represented in a human form like [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Saraswati]] or [[Kali]]. Sometimes there are gods goddesses in human and animal fused form like [[Ganesh]]. Sometimes they are also represented in plants and non-living form like [[Tulsi]] and [[Shaligrams]]. Murtis are made according to the prescriptios of the ilpasastra, and then installed by priests through the prana pratishtha ceremony. Afterward the divine personality is believed to be present in the Murtis. 
 
 == Method == 
 To show respect, Hindus give gifts and food to the murtis. They are treated with respect and worshipped everyday. If a temple is a family temple it is treated as part of the family. Some Hindus also offer a part of their daily food to the god or goddess. They are given clothes and are changed at certain times.
