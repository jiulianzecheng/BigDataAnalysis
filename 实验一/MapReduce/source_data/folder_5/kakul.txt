 '''Kakul''' is a hamlet and union council in the '''Kakul Valley''' of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]]. It is 5 & nbsp;km north of [[Abbottabad]] city near the [[Thandiani]] Hills at a height of 1300 metres. The Pakistan Military Academy is also located here. 
 
 ==History== 
 Kakul was historically a small village in the suburbs of Abbottabad, close to the larger [[Nawanshehr]] hamlet, which was owned by the [[Jadoon]] [[Pashtun]] tribe. < ref > Hazara Gazetteer, 1883-84, pub. Govt of the Punjab, 1884, p 211 < /ref >  When the Hazara region was annexed to [[British India]] in 1849, the then District Commissioner Major [[James Abbott]] decided to build a cantonment town which was founded in 1853 as [[Abbottabad]]; < ref > Gazetteer, p.35 < /ref >  and at that time, a smaller military station or tented garrison was set up close to Kakul. In 1900-1901 this site became one of the first 'concentration camps' for  [[Boer]] Prisoners of War (POWs) from the [[Anglo-Boer War]], where some 400 such prisoners were held until 1903. < ref > See 'Boer POWS at Abbottabad' in ''Durbar:Journal of the Indian Military Historical Society'' UK, Vol 28 No 2, Summer 2011, pp.64-67 < /ref >  In 1904-1905, a part of this camp became the [[British Indian Army]]s Mountaineering and PE Camp, whereas the rest was made into the zonal headquarters of the [[Royal Indian Army Supply Corps]](RIASC). < ref > Imperial Gazeteer for 1910-1911, Vol 21, pp.104-105 < /ref >  This position lasted until 1947, when after Independence the new [[Pakistan Army]] decided to set up the [[Pakistan Military Academy]] here, which was done in 1948. 
 
 ==Administration== 
 The small township of Kakul is the capital of Kakul [[Union Council]]. The Union Council is divided into the following areas: Balolia, Kakul, Mandroch Kalan, Mandroch Khurd, Nawansher Janoobi and Nawansher Shamali. < ref name= " AbbGov " / >
