 '''Accipitriformes''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] which includes most of the [[diurnal]] [[birds of prey]]: [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[vulture]]s, and many others, about 225 [[species]] in all.  
 
 For a long time, the majority view was to include them with the [[falcon]]s in the [[Falconiformes]]. However, a recent [[DNA]] study has shown that falcons are not closely related to the Accipitriformes. Instead, they are related to [[parrot]]s and [[passerine]]s. < ref name=Hackett > Hackett S.J. ''et al'' 2008. A phylogenomic study of birds reveals their evolutionary history. ''Science'' '''320''' (5884): 1763–1768. [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5884/1763.abstract] < /ref > 
 
 Since then putting the falcons next to the [[parrots]] in [[taxonomic]] order has been adopted by most [[ornithologist]]s. The DNA-based proposal includes the [[New World vulture]]s in the Accipitriformes, < ref name=Hackett/ >  but the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) classifies the New World vultures as a separate order, the [[Cathartiformes]]. < ref > Remsen J.V.
