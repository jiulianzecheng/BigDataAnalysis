 '''Nyctaginaceae''', the four o'clock family, has about 33 [[genera]] and 290 [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s. It grows in tropical and [[subtropical]] regions, with a few representatives in temperate regions. It includes plants like the ''[[Bougainvillea]]'' and the four o'clock. Most of the species are [[vines]]. 
 
 The family has a unique [[fruit]] type, called an  " anthocarp " . < ref > An anthocarp is an accessory fruit: some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some exterior tissue. < /ref >  Many genera have extremely large ( > 100 Âµm) [[pollen grain]]s. 
 
 A curious aspect of ''M. jalapa'', the four o'clock, is that flowers with different colours grow [[wikt:simultaneous|simultaneously]] on the same plant.
