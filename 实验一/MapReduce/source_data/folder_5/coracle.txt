This is related to the Irish and [[Scottish Gaelic]] word ''[[currach]].'' It is recorded in English as early as the [[16th century]]. Other old English spellings include ''corougle'', ''corracle'', ''[[curricle]]'' and ''coricle''.

 Corricles are oval in shape, and look like half a [[walnut]] shell. They are made with a framework of split [[willow]] branches, twisted together and tied with willow bark. Originally the outer layer was an animal skin from a horse or [[Cattle|bullock]]. < ref name= " eb1911 " > {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Coracle}} < /ref >   These skins were covered with a thin layer of [[tar]] to make them keep the water out. Today coracles are made with [[Calico (textile)|calico]] or [[canvas]] covered in tar, or simply [[fibreglass]]. The Asian coracle is made differently. It uses [[bamboo]] and the water is kept out with a layer of [[resin]] and [[coconut]] oil. < ref > {{Cite book | publisher = Thames  &  Hudson | isbn = 0-500-05130-5 | last = Fagan | first = Brian M. | title = The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World | year = 2004 }} < /ref >  The coracle does not have a [[keel]]. The flat bottom allows the weight of the boat and its load to be spread evenly. This means it does not need much water to float – as little as a few inches, making it ideal for use on rivers. 
 
 Coracles have different designs, as they are designed for the river conditions where they are built and used. The Teifi coracle is flat-bottomed, because it is designed for use in the shallow rapids which common on the river in the summer. The Carmarthen coracle is rounder and deeper, because it is used in tidal waters on the Tywi, where there are no rapids. Teifi coracles are made from local wood. They use willow for the body of the boat, called a lats. Hazel is used for the bit around the top, called Y bleth in Welsh. Tywi coracles have been made from sawn ash for a long time. These days working boats are made from [[fibreglass]]. Teifi coracles do not use nails. The twisting together of the lats makes them strong. The Carmarthen coracles use copper nails and are not twisted together. 
 
 Coracles are good for fishing because they do not disturb the water or the fish. They can be controlled easily with one arm, while the other arm manages the net; two coracles to a net. The coracle is moved with a broad-bladed [[paddle]]. These are also have different designs between different rivers. It is used in a [[Sculling#Single-oar sculling|sculling]] action. The blade makes a figure-of-eight pattern in the water. The paddle is used towards the front of the coracle, pulling the boat forward, with the paddler facing in the direction of travel. < ref > [http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial/coracle/coracle.htm The Nature of a Coracle] < /ref > 
 
 A Welsh Coracle can be carried by a person on their back. 'Llwyth dyn ei gorwgl' — the load of a man is his coracle. (Welsh saying). 
 
 ==History== 
 The coracle was designed to be used in the quickly flowing streams of Wales and parts of the rest of Britain and Ireland. Coracles are very old, [[Julius Caesar]] < ref name= " eb1911 " / >  saw them in Britain in the [[1st century BC]]. [[Archaeologists]] believe they have discovered the remains of a coracle in a [[Bronze Age]] grave at Barns Farm near [[Dalgety Bay]]. Others have been discovered at [[Corbridge]] and near [[Ferriby]]. < ref > Watkins, Trevor et al.

 Coracles are so light that they can easily be carried on the fisherman's shoulders. Coracle fishing is performed by two coraclers. The net is stretched across the river between the two coracles. These are paddled with one handed and the net is dragged down the river in the other. When a fish is caught, each fisherman pulls up an end of the net until the two coracles are brought to touch, and the fish is grabbed and put into the boat. 
 
 ===Today=== 
 Coracles are not used much these days. They can be seen in [[tourist]] areas of West Wales, and sometimes in [[Shropshire]] on the River Severn. There is a [[public house]] in [[Sundorne]], Shrewsbury called  " The Coracle " . It has a sign showing a man using a coracle on a river. The Welsh Rivers Teifi and [[River Tywi|Tywi]] are the best places to find coracles in Wales. On the Teifi they are usually seen between [[Cenarth]], [[Cilgerran]] and [[Llechryd]]. 
 
 In 1974 Bernard Thomas of Llechryd crossed the [[English Channel]] to France in 13½ hours in a coracle. The journey showed how the [[Bull Boat]]s of the [[Mandan]] Indians of [[North Dakota]] could have been copied from coracles introduced by [[Prince Madog]] in the 12th century. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.britannia.com/celtic/wales/facts/facts7.html |title=Wales on Britannia: Facts About Wales  &  the Welsh < !-- Bot generated title -- >  |access-date=2014-05-08 |archive-date=2008-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011090450/http://www.britannia.com/celtic/wales/facts/facts7.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 For many years until 1979, [[Shrewsbury]] coracle maker Fred Davies became famous among football fans. He would sit in his coracle during [[Shrewsbury Town FC]] home matches at Gay Meadow, and get the footballs that landed in the River Severn. Although Davies died in 1994, his legend is still linked to the club. < ref > ''Gentlemen of the River'' by Phyllis Blakemore. Stenlake Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-84033-473-9}} < /ref > 
 
 ==The Coracle Society== 
 The Coracle Society is a UK-based organisation, started by its president, Sir Peter Badge in 1990. The society wanted: 
 *To increase the knowledge of coracles, curraghs and similar boats; their making and use, and their study and collection, 
 *To support fishing which used coracles; and to encourage the holding of coracle regattas and races, 
 *To print a newsletter, 
 *To find supplies of materials to build coracles, and 
 *To increase demonstrations, courses, [[exhibition]]s, discussions and lectures relating to coracles. < ref > [https://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/constitution%20october%202019.pdf The coracle society constitution] < /ref > 
 
 There are many Society members across the country who show the coracle at events and/or run coracle building courses. Terry Kenny, the current chairman of the Society, runs several courses each year at the [[Green Wood Centre]]. Some of this year's events are listed on the [http://www.coraclesociety.org.uk official Coracle Society website]. 
 
 The Society was present at the 2005 [[Shrewsbury River Festival]], where they had various coracles on the [[River Severn]]. There is also an Annual Coracle Regatta held in [[Ironbridge]] on the August Bank Holiday Monday every year. It is organised by the [[Green Wood Centre]]. Anyone with a coracle can take part in the event. Each year new people come with coracles which they have made on the Bank Holiday weekend at the Green Wood Centre with local coracle maker Terry Kenny. 
 
 The third Coracle Challenge, which raises funds in support of [[Macmillan Cancer Support]] took place in [[Shrewsbury]] on 19 May 2009. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/events.php |title=Coracle Society events listings |access-date=2014-05-08 |archive-date=2012-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222105130/http://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/events.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.coraclemaker.co.uk/calendar.htm |title=The Coracle Maker – Calendar of events |access-date=2014-05-08 |archive-date=2012-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222104006/http://www.coraclemaker.co.uk/calendar.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Safety== 
 The coracle is an unstable craft. Because it sits  " on "  the water, rather than  " in "  it, the vessel can easily be carried by currents and the wind. The Coracle Society has written a guide for safely using coracles. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/csg_0.pdf |title=Coracle Society safety guidelines |access-date=2014-05-08 |archive-date=2014-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234217/http://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/csg_0.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Similar craft== 
 The oldest instructions for building a coracle are on a 4000-year-old [[cuneiform]] clay tablet. This was dictated by the Mesopotamian god [[Enki]] to [[Atra-Hasis]] on how to build a round  " ark " . The tablet is about 2,250 years older than than the [[flood myth]]s, none of which contain such details. < ref > {{cite news |title= Noah's Ark Was Round, Based On 4,000-Year-Old Mesopotamian Instructions That Are 'Mathematically Accurate' |author= Gabrielle Jonas |url= http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/6746/20140128/noahs-ark-round-mesopotamia-flood-cuneiform-instructions-mathematically-accurate.htm |newspaper= International Science Times |date= January 28, 2014 |access-date= March 4, 2014 |quote= Four thousand-year-old cuneiform instructions on how to build a round  " Noah's ark "  have turned out to be mathematically on-target, the British Museum curator who translated the text told the ''International Science Times'' Monday. |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/6NoxqoE1E?url=http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/6746/20140128/noahs-ark-round-mesopotamia-flood-cuneiform-instructions-mathematically-accurate.htm |archive-date= March 4, 2014 |url-status= dead }} < /ref >  The earliest known written evidence of a coracle-type boat (quffa), still in use today, is in the Bible, Exodus 2:3. 
 
 The Irish [[curach]] (also ''currach'' or ''curragh'') is a similar, but larger, vessel still in use today. Curachs were also used in the west of Scotland: 
 
 : " The ''curach'' or boat of leather and wicker may seem to moderns a very unsafe vehicle, to trust to tempestuous seas, yet our forefathers fearlessly committed themselves in these slight vehicles to the mercy of the most violent weather. They were once much in use in the [[Western Isles]] of Scotland, and are still found in Wales. The framework [in Gaelic] is called ''crannghail'', a word now used in [[Uist]] to signify a frail boat. " < ref > ''[[Edward Dwelly|Dwelly]]'s [http://www.dwelly.info/index.aspx  & #91;Scottish & #93; Gaelic Dictionary''] < /ref > 
 
 The currachs in the River Spey were very similar to Welsh coracles. Other related craft include: 
 
 *[[India]] – ''[[parisal]]'' 
 *[[Iraq]] – ''gufa'', ''[[guffa]]'' or ''quffa'' 
 *[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American societies]] – ''[[bull boat]]'' 
 *[[Tibet]] – ''[[ku-dru]]'' and ''[[kowas]]'' 
 *[[Vietnam]] – ''[[thung-chai]]''
