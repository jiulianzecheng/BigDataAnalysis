'''Libido''' is a person's 'sex drive'. A person's overall sexual drive (desire for [[sexual activity]]) varies greatly. Someone with a libido is called an ''allosexual''. Someone without it is called ''asexual''. < ref > Antonsen, Amy N., et al.  " Ace and Aro: Understanding Differences in Romantic Attractions Among Persons Identifying as Asexual. "  Archives of Sexual Behavior (2020): 1-16. < /ref > 
 
 Sex drive is influenced by [[biological]], [[psychological]] and social factors.  [[Sex hormone]]s like 
 [[testosterone]], and [[neurotransmitter]]s like [[dopamine]] affect the libido. Both of these work on a brain [[nucleus (brain)|nucleus]] called the ''nucleus accumbens'' (one in each half of the brain). These centres work on [[motivation]], [[learning]], and [[reinforcement]]. 
 
 Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, such as [[personality]] and [[stress (biology)|stress]], can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, [[medication]], [[lifestyle]] and [[intimacy|relationship]] issues, and age (e.g. [[puberty]]).
