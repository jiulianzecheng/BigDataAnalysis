 A '''crater''' is a round dent on a planet. They are usually [[shape]]d like a [[circle]] or an [[oval]]. They are usually made by something like a [[meteor]] hitting the surface of a [[planet]]. Underground activity such as [[volcano]]es or [[explosion]]s can also cause them but it's not as likely.
