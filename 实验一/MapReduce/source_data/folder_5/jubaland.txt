'''Jubaland''' is the southern-most state in [[Somalia]]. It lies between [[Koofur Orsi]] and the [[Somali Sea]]. Before 1925, Jubaland was called ''British Jubaland''. At that time, British Jubaland was controlled by the British empire. Afterwards it was given away to Italy for 15 years. In the 21st century Jubaland was again created. The men who created Jubaland were Barre Adan Hiraale, Cabdicasiis Aganje Garamgaram, Abdulahi Faratag, Mohamed Gandhi and Maxamed Boodhe. < ref > Reuben, John Kisilu.
