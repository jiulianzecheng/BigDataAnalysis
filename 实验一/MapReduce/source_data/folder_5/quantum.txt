In [[physics]], a '''quantum''' (plural: ''quanta'') is a very small object that is involved in some interaction. It has one of several possible states. [[Theoretical physics]] uses quanta for calculations.  
 
 There are special sciences such as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics,]] or [[quantum thermodynamics]] that study quanta, and their interactions. 
 
 Examples: 
 
 * [[Photon|Photons]] are quanta of the [[electromagnetic field]]. 
 * [[Phonon|Phonons]] are quanta of mechanical distortions in a solid 
 * [[Plasmon|Plasmons]] 
 * [[Magnon|Magnons]] 
 * [[Gluon|Gluons]] are quanta of the force field that transmits the strong interaction 
 * [[Graviton|Gravitons]]
