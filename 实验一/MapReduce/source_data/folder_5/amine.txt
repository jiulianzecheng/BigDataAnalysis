 An '''[[amine]]''' is a [[molecule]] which has a [[nitrogen]] [[atom]] that can behave as a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. An amine can be thought of coming from [[ammonia]]. The difference is that the three [[hydrogen]]s in ammonia are changed to any group or atom. If only one of the hydrogens is changed, the amine is called primary. If two are changed, the amine is called secondary. If all three are changed then it is called tertiary.  
 
 Sometimes, a fourth group can be added to the nitrogen. This is called a quaternary ammonium cation. This is not an amine but is a [[salt]]. If one of the groups on the nitrogen is a [[carbonyl]] group, then the molecule is called [[amide]]. This has very different properties. 
 
 Amines are used a lot in [[chemistry]]. Since the nitrogen has a [[lone pair]], it can do many [[chemical reaction|reaction]]s. It can take [[proton]]s away from some [[acid]]s. It can also be a [[nucleophile]]. It can be changed into imines and other [[functional group]]s. 
 
 Amines are also found in many [[protein]]s. They are a part of every [[amino acid]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Amines - Formula, Structure, Nomenclature, Classification, Preparation, Basicity, FAQs and Videos of Amines.|url=https://byjus.com/chemistry/amines/|access-date=2023-09-13|website=BYJUS|language=en}} < /ref >
