'''Pseudoallergy''' is something a living body does when it takes a new medicine for the first time.  A pseudollergic response, can mean an [[anaphylactic]] reaction, which means too much [[plasma|water]] leaves the blood.  A pseudoallery is not an immune response.  Human beings can die from pseudoallergies. < ref name=Ph > {{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pseudoallergy|access-date=April 2, 2021|title=Urticaria, Angioedema, and Anaphylaxis|author1=Clive E.H.
