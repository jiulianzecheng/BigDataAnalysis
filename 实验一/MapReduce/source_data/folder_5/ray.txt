 The '''rays''', or '''batoids''', are a group of [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] containing more than 500 described [[species]] in thirteen [[family (biology)|families]]. They include four [[order (biology)|orders]]. 
 
 Rays are mostly flattened in shape, and usually [[demersal]], living and eating at the bottom of the sea. The group first appears in the [[Triassic]] period, after 95% of [[Ocean|marine]] species had been wiped out by the [[P/Tr extinction event]].

 == Description == 
 === Appearance === 
 Rays look like bats in the water, and this is probably why they are called batoids. They have pectoral [[fin]]s that are attached to their bodies from back to front, similar to the way a bat's wings attach from its shoulder to its feet. 
 
 The fins of the ray create a disk shape that can be round, [[triangle|triangular]], or [[diamond]]-shaped. Rays use their pectoral fins to 'fly' through the water. Though a bony fish takes in water with its mouth, rays do not because they live at the bottom of the ocean. If they took in water through their mouths, they would probably just get a mouthful of [[sand]]. Because of this, they have [[breathe|breathing]] holes on top of their bodies called ''spiracles''. Rays use spiracles to take in water that is then sent over the gills. 
 
 Also, because they do not have a swim [[bladder]], rays sink when they are not actively swimming. 
 
 === Social Animals === 
 Interestingly, rays are usually curious and social animals. Though they often live [[wikt:alone|alone]], they like [[swim]]ming together in groups with other rays. [[wikt:despite|Despite]] the fact that they are able to swim, most rays live at the bottom of the sea, eating [[benthos|benthic]] animals. In fact, they often flick sand on their backs to [[camouflage]] (disguise, or hide) themselves as they lie in the sand at the bottom of the ocean.
