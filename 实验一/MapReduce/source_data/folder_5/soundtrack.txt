 == History == 
 In 1896 when people saw the first [[motion picture]] someone played music to go along with it. < ref name=SlobinVII > Mark Slobin, ''Global Soundtracks: Worlds of Film Music'' (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 2008), p. vii < /ref >  This was the era of the [[silent movie]] meaning only that the [[actor]]s did not speak. A [[musician]] played different [[music]] to show [[drama]], the [[Character actor|character]] types and the [[wikt:storyline|storyline]]. < ref name=SlobinVII/ >  There was music to introduce [[war]], [[Native American|indians]], [[cowboy]]s and other types to the scenes. There was special music to introduce the [[hero]]. Even the [[villain]] had his own musical pieces to identify him. Finally, in 1927 moviemakers figured out how to include a soundtrack on the film. The movie ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 movie)|The Jazz Singer]]'' was the first musical where the audience could hear [[Al Jolson]] perform. < ref name=SlobinVII/ >
