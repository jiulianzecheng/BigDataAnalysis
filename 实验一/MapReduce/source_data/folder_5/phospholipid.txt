 '''Phospholipids''' are a type of [[lipid|fat]] that contain [[phosphorus]]. < ref > Introduction to lipids. Carnegie Mellon University. [http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/biology/MembranePage/index2.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612051816/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/biology/MembranePage/index2.html |date=2007-06-12 }} < /ref >  They are major parts of all [[cell membranes]] because they form [[lipid bilayer]]s.  
 
 Phospholipid molecules usually have [[hydrophobic]] tails and a [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] head. < ref > hydrophobic = water-rejecting; hydrophilic = water-loving. < /ref >  Biological membranes in [[eukaryotes]] also contain another class of lipid, [[Sterol|sterols]]. These are spaced out among the phospholipids. Together they provide membrane fluidity and mechanical strength.  Purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Mashaghi S; Jadidi T.  &  Koenderink G.
