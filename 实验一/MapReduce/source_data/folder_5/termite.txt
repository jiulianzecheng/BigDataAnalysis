 '''Termites''' are a [[Order (biology)|suborder]] of [[social]] [[insect]]s, the '''Isoptera'''. They are sometimes called '' " white [[ant]]s " '', incorrectly, because ants belong to the Order [[Hymenoptera]].  
 
 They are ''[[eusocial]]'' animals, as are ants and some [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s. Termites mostly feed on detritus, mostly wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung. There are an estimated 4,000 species (about 2,600 taxonomically known). About 10% are [[pest]]s which can cause serious structural damage to [[building]]s, crops or plantation [[forest]]s.  
 
 Termites are major [[detrivore]]s in the [[Subtropics|subtropical]] and [[Tropics|tropical]] regions. Their recycling of wood and other plant matter is very important for [[ecology]]. 
 
 A termite [[Colony (biology)|colony]] starts when winged termites (called ''alates'') swarm and mate. After mating, they fall to the ground and rip off their [[wing]]s. The female looks for a good place to start the colony, and the male follows her. Most termites nest underground their entire lives, but termites in [[Africa]] and [[Australia]] actually build really big mound structures that look like little [[mountain]]s and can be more than 20 feet tall (see photo below). 
 
 Termites live in colonies that, at maturity, hold from several hundred to several million individuals. They are a prime example self-organised systems which use [[swarm intelligence]]. They use this cooperation to exploit food sources and environments which would not be available to any single insect acting alone. A typical colony contains [[nymphs]] (semi-mature young), workers, soldiers, and reproductive individuals of both genders, sometimes containing several egg-laying queens.
