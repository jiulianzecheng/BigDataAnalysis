A '''beadle''' is someone who works at a [[church]] or a Jewish [[synagogue]] and helps the [[clergy]].  A beadle's main job is to show people to their seats and to keep order during church services. In the past they were important in running [[Workhouse|workhouses]]. 
 
 Like many words that describe a person's job, the word '''beadle''' can also be used as a [[last name]].
