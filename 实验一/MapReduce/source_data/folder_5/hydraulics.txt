 '''Hydraulics''' is a topic of [[science]] and [[engineering]] subject dealing with the mechanical properties of [[liquid]]s. Many machines work on hydraulic power. 
 
 One of the founders of modern hydraulics was [[Benedetto Castelli]], a student of [[Galileo Galilei]]. 
 
 [[Fluid mechanics]] provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the [[engineering]] uses of fluid properties.
