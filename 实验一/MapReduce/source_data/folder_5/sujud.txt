 '''Sujud''' (Arabic: سُجدة), or prostration (Arabic: سجدة),  also known as sijdah is a part of prayer. Standing from ruku, then prostration is done by touching the forehead and nose on the ground. At the same time the knees and palms are placed on the ground. Sijdah is one of the essential parts of prayers. The prostration is to face the [[Kaaba]]. During Sijdah, one has to recite Tasbeeh of Subhana Rabbiyal Ala (سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْأَعْلَى).
