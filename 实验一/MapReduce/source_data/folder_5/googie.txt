 '''Googie''' is the term given to a type of [[architecture]] and [[art]] in the United States in the 20th century.  It is also called '''Doo Wop''', '''Atomic age''', or '''populuxe'''.   It was very futuristic, echoing themes of the 1950s as a whole.  Some of Googie architecture was based on what [[spaceship]]s look like.  It started in [[California]] soon after [[World War II]] and spread to the rest of the United States in the 1950s.  Many of the buildings built in the Googie style were [[coffee shop]]s, [[bowling alley]]s and [[motel]]s.   
 
 Here are a few famous Googie buildings: 
 
 * The [[Space Needle]] 
 * [[Los Angeles International Airport]] 
 * The first [[Tomorrowland]] at [[Disneyland]] 
 * The first [[McDonald's]] 
 * Many of the early casinos in [[Las Vegas]]
