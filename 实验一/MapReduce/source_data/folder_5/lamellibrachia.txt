 [[File:Lamellibrachia luymesi.png|thumb|right|220px|[[Symbiotic]] tubeworm ''Lamellibrachia luymesi'' from a cold seep at 550 metres in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the sediments around the base are orange [[bacterial mat]]s of the sulphide-oxidizing bacteria ''Beggiatoa''. There are empty shells of [[clam]]s and [[snail]]s, which are also common in the seeps. < ref name=Boetius > Boetius A. 2005.

 '''''Lamellibrachia''''' is a [[genus (biology)|genus]] of ''cold seep tube worms''. These are related to [[giant tube worm]]s. They live on the floor of the [[ocean]]s, near [[cold seep]]s. There [[crude oil]] and [[methane]] leak out of the ocean floor.  
 
 The worm forms a [[symbiosis]] with certain [[bacteria]] which can [[oxidation|oxidise]] [[sulphide]]s. The worm provides the bacteria with [[hydrogen sulphide]] and [[oxygen]]. It does this by taking them up from the environment and binding them to a [[haemoglobin]] molecule. In return, the bacteria feed the worm. The worms can grow to a length of about 3 metres. 
 
 Together, they form a 'biogenic [[habitat]]' by creating groups of hundreds or thousands of individuals. Living in these aggregations are over a hundred different [[species]] of organism, many of which are found only at these seeps. 
 
 Cold seeps and [[hydrothermal vent]]s are the only known communities that do not rely on [[photosynthesis]] for food and energy production. Unlike hydrothermal vents, which are short-lived environments, cold seeps leak oil and gas slowly. Probably because of the cooler temperatures and stability, many cold seep organisms are much longer-lived than those inhabiting hydrothermal vents. These worm grow very slowly, but can reach lengths of over 10 feet (3 metres). This means individuals may live over 250 years. < ref > Science Daily: [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/02/000203075002.htm] < /ref >
