 [[Image:Day of Hajj. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|250px|A view of Makkah during the Hajj, with [[Mount Arafat|Mt. Arafat]] in the distance.]] 
 '''Mecca''' or '''Makkah''' (officially: '''Makkah al-Mukarramah'''; {{lang-ar|مكة المكرمة}}) is a [[city]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] and the holiest city in [[Islam]]. As of the 2004 census, 1,294,169 people lived there. The city is {{convert|73|km|mi}} inland from [[Jeddah]], in the narrow sandy Valley of Abraham. It is {{convert|277|m|ft}} above sea level. It is {{convert|81|km|mi}} from the [[Red Sea]].  
 
 Makkah is the holiest city in the [[Islamic world]]. Every year, millions of Muslims take a [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca, called the [[Hajj]]. They follow in the footsteps of [[Muhammad]]. All Muslims who are able to perform the Hajj are expected to do so at least once in their life. The [[Kaaba]] and [[Masjid al-Haram]], are the holiest [[mosque]] < nowiki/ > s in Islam. Mecca is closed to non-Muslims except for some journalists reporting on the Hajj. 
 
 == History == 
 The [[Kaaba]], the small cubical [[building]] which [[Muslim]]s pray towards is believed to have been built by [[Ibrahim]] and has been a religious center ever since. Muslims believed that [[Allah|God]] commanded Ibrahim to send his second wife Hajar and her son [[Ismail]] there. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true & yusufali=true & shakir=true & arabic=true & chapter=14 & verseBegin=37 & verseEnd=37 |title=The Qur'an 14:37 |access-date=2006-10-07 |archive-date=2007-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015185519/http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true & yusufali=true & shakir=true & arabic=true & chapter=14 & verseBegin=37 & verseEnd=37 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They found the [[Zamzam Well]] which led to people settling nearby, and thus Makkah was born. When Ismail was big enough, he helped his father to build the Kaaba. The Kaaba is the place towards which Muslims turn in prayer. This is known as the Qibla. < ref > [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.127 The Qur'an 2:217] < /ref >
