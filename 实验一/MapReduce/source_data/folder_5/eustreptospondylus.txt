 '''Eustreptospondylus''' (meaning  " well-reversed vertebrae " ) was a megalosaurid tetanuran theropod (a large, bipedal meat-eater) about 23-30 ft (7-9 m) long, weighing about 440-550 pounds (200 kg to 250 kg). This predator had a large [[head]], long, sharp serrated [[teeth]], short arms and a primitive hip structure. It lived during the mid-[[Jurassic]] period, about 165 million years ago. Incomplete fossils have been found in [[England]]. Eustreptospondylus was named by [[Richard Owen]] in [[1841]]. The type species is ''E. oxoniensis'', which was named by C. A. Walker in [[1964]].
