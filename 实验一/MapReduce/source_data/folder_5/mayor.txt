A '''mayor''' is a [[person]] who is in charge of the [[administration]] of a [[city]].  Some mayors are [[election|elected]] by the people who live in that [[city]].  For other cities, a central [[government]] body may choose the mayor.  Some large cities have a [[Lord Mayor]]. 
 
 In [[Federal republic|federal]] countries like [[Germany]] the mayor can also be head of the government of a [[city state]]. The [[Mayor of Hamburg]] runs the government just like the [[Minister President]] of [[Bavaria]] runs the Bavarian government. In some big cities such as [[Tokyo]] the Mayor is a [[Governor]]. 
 
 In many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], the mayor is not in charge of the daily functions of a city or town. That job is done by a Town Clerk or Chief Executive, who is appointed to a full-time paid job. The mayor works part-time, usually without payment, and represents the city at events and civic functions.
