 '''Collies''' form a [[Dog type|type]] of [[Herding dog|herding dogs]], including many similar [[Landrace|landraces]] and [[Breed standard| standardized]] [[Dog breed|breeds]]. The type began in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]].  Collies are usually medium-sized, fairly lightly-built dogs, with pointed noses.  Many breeds have a white color over the shoulders.  Collies are very active, and most types of collies are excellent at [[herding]].  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially [[Australia]] and [[North America]]), and have then made many varieties, sometimes mixed with other dog types (cross breeding, for example, the Borador).  Some collie breeds are still used as [[Working dog|working dogs]] for herding [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and other [[livestock]], while others are kept as [[Pet|pets]], [[Show dog|show dogs]] or for [[List of dog sports|dog sports]], in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the [[American Kennel Club]] has a breed they call  " collie " , in fact ''collie dogs'' are a type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major differences between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports: the herding dogs show good agility, stamina and trainability and behaviour. 
 
 Common use of the name  " collie "  in some areas is limited to certain breeds â€” the name means [[Rough Collie]] in parts of the United States, and [[Border Collie]] in many parts of Great Britain.  Most collie dog types do not actually include  " collie "  in their name (see [[Welsh Sheepdog]] at right).
