 '''Tikrit''' sometimes known as '''Takrit''' or '''Tekrit''', is a city in [[Iraq]], located {{convert|140|km|mi}} northwest of [[Baghdad]] and {{convert|220|km|mi}} southeast of [[Mosul]] on the [[Tigris River]]. As of 2012, it has a population of 160,000. 
 
 At least 80% majority of the people are Sunni. [[Saddam Hussein]], leader of Iraq through April 2003, was born there; he considered it his hometown. He was actually born in a village on the outskirts of Tikrit, however in a part of Tikrit municipality.
