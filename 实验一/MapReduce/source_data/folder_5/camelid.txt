 *'''Camelidae''' 
 **Genus ''Lama'' 
 *** [[Llama]], ''Lama glama'' 
 *** [[Guanaco]], ''Lama guanicoe'' 
 ** Genus: ''Vicugna''  
 *** [[Vicu√±a]], ''Vicugna vicugna''

 The animals of the genus ''Camelus'' are also called ''Afro-Asiatic Camelids''. The animals of the genus ''Lama'' and genus ''Vicugna'' are also called ''South American Camelids''.  
 
 ===Hybrid=== 
 There also exists a camelid [[hybrid]] called a ''Cama''. It is the child of a female Llama and a male Dromedary Camel. The Cama does not exist in nature, but is  " made "  by humans through [[artificial insemination]] (that means the [[sperm]] is artificially put into the female). 
 
 ==Habitat== 
 The two ''Camelus'' species originally lived in northern [[Africa]], south-west and eastern [[Asia]]. The other four camelids lived in [[South America]]. 
 
 ==Camelids and humans== 
 Camelids have been [[domestication|domesticated]] by humans for about 5000 years. They have been important for transport, but were also kept for [[wool]], [[meat]] and [[milk]]. The llama and alpaca were very important for the South American cultures, like the [[Inca]]. The camels were used by people in north Africa and Asia, especially in [[desert]]s.
