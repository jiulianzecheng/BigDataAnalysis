 The '''banjo''' is a [[string instrument]], that was first played by African slaves in the [[United States]]  a few hundred years ago. The idea came from other African instruments. < ref > [http://www.ibma.org/about.bluegrass/history/index.asp Bluegrass Music: The Roots] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822015618/http://www.ibma.org/about.bluegrass/history/index.asp|date=2006-08-22}}. "  [[International Bluegrass Music Association|IBMA]]. Retrieved on [[2006-08-25]] < /ref >    
 The name ''banjo'' may have come from a Kimbundu word: ''mbanza'', but it could have also come from a Senegambian word for the [[bamboo]] stick used for the banjo's neck. 
 
 The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a guitar, has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast arpeggiated plucking, though many different playing styles exist.
