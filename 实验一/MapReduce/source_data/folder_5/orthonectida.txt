 '''Orthonectida''' is a small [[phylum]] of poorly-known [[parasite]]s of [[Ocean|marine]] [[invertebrate]]s. They are among the simplest of multi-cellular [[organism]]s. < ref name= " pmid8896370 " > {{cite journal |author=Ben Hanelt, David Van Schyndel, Coen M. Adema, Louise A. Lewis  &  Eric S.

 == Biology == 
 The adults are microscopic wormlike animals. They have a single layer of outer cells surrounding a mass of sex cells. They swim freely within the bodies of their hosts, which include [[flatworm]]s, [[polychaete]] worms, [[bivalve]] molluscs, and [[echinoderm]]s. They have separate male and female individuals. < ref name=IZ > {{cite book |author=Robert D. Barnes |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 247–248|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}} < /ref > 
 
 === Reproduction === 
 When they are ready to reproduce, the adults are released from the host, and sperm from the males penetrates the bodies of the females to achieve [[fertilisation]]. The resulting [[zygote]] develops into a [[cilia]]ted [[larva]] that escapes from the mother to seek out new hosts. Once it finds a host, the larva loses its cilia and develops into a [[syncytium|syncytial]] plasmodium larva. This, in turn, breaks up into numerous individual cells that become the next generation of adults. < ref name=IZ/ > 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 The orthonectids were originally described in 1877 as a class, and placed as an order of the phylum [[Mesozoa]]. Recent study shows that orthonectids are quite different from the [[rhombozoa]]ns, the other group in Mesozoa. < ref name= " pmid8896370 " / >
