 A '''scooter''' is a [[bicycle]] or [[tricycle]] with very small wheels. Some scooters have a motor, some have pedals, and some are pushed with the foot. Scooters with motors are called ''motor scooters''. There are many different kinds of scooters. They include motor scooters and kick scooters. 
 
 Some scooters have four wheels. People who don't have much balance can drive that kind. 
 
 In some places, riders of motor scooters need a [[driver's license]] for driving a [[motorcycle]]. In other places, they only need a licence for driving a [[moped]]. Some scooters can hold two people.
