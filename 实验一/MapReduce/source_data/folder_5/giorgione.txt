 '''Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco''' ( born 1477 or 1478, died 1510) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] painter. He is commonly known as '''Giorgione'''. He died a little over 30, probably of the [[plague]]. Today, only about six paintings can be clearly attributed to him. This makes him one of the most mysterious painters of his time. Together with [[Titian]] he was one of the most influential painters of his period. He was one of the first Venitian Painters to use [[Oil paint|Oil Paints]] for a medium.
