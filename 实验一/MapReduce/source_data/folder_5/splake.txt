 The '''splake''' or '''slake''' (''Salvelinus namaeycush X Salvelinus fontinalis'') is a fish. It is the [[hybrid]] of a male [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis'') and a female [[lake trout]] (''Salvelinus namaycush'').  The name is a combination of speckled trout (another name for brook trout) and lake trout. The name may have been used as early as the 1880s. < ref > Kerr, S. J. (2000): ''F1 Splake: An Annotated Bibliography and Literature Review''.  Fish and Wildlife Branch, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Peterborough, Ontario.  79p. + appendices.
