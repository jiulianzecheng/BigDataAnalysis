 '''Drought''' is a continuous period of dry weather, when an area gets less than its normal amount of [[rain]], over months or even years.   [[Crops]] and other [[plant]]s need [[water]] to grow, and [[animal]]s need it to [[life|live]].  Droughts can become dangerous to people and other [[Terrestrial animal|land animals]]; causing [[famine]] and even creating [[desert]]s. 
 
 The word  " drought "  comes from the Old English drugað, drugoð  " drought, dryness, desert, "  from Proto-Germanic *drugothaz, from Germanic root *dreug-  " dry "  (cf high/height) with *-itho, Germanic suffix for forming abstract nouns (see -th (2)). 
 
 A drought is a natural event, caused by other [[weather]] events like [[El Niño]] and [[high-pressure system]]s.  Drought can also be triggered by [[deforestation]] (people cutting down [[forest]]s), by [[global warming]], and by diverting [[river]]s or emptying [[lake]]s. 
 
 Drought is a [[natural disaster]] which usually takes place slowly.  It is often difficult to decide when a drought started and sometimes when it ends too.  Its effects often build up slowly over a long period of time and may last from months to years after rain resumes. 
 
 Many people die every year in [[famine]]s due to drought in [[subsistence farming]] areas. [[Conflict]]s can result from drought conditions. < ref > [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324096404578356641273405884.html ''Texas Is Ordered to Supply Water to Crane Habitat''] March 12, 2013 < /ref >
