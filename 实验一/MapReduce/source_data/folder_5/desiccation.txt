'''Desiccation''' is the state of extreme [[wikt:dry|dryness]], or the process of extreme drying.  
 
 A '''desiccant''' is a [[hygroscopic]] (water-attracting) substance that causes desiccation in a moderately sealed container. 
 
 == Biology == 
 '''Desiccation tolerance''' refers to the ability of an organism to withstand or endure extreme dryness, or [[drought]]-like conditions.  
 
 Plants and animals living in [[arid]] or periodically arid [[environment]]s such as temporary [[stream]]s or [[pond]]s may face desiccation, therefore [[Physiology|physiological]] or [[Behaviour|behavioural]] [[adaptation]]s are necessary to ensure survival. In particular, [[insects]] occupy a wide range of [[Ecology|ecologically]] diverse [[niche]]s and so have a variety of strategies to avoid desiccation.  
 
 Desiccation resistance in insects is generally measured by the change in mass during dry conditions. < ref name=Chownetal > {{cite journal |author=Chown S.L.  &  Nicolson S.W. |title=Insect physiological ecology|journal=New York: Oxford University Press |year=2004}} < /ref >   The overall mass difference between measurements before and after aridity exposure is attributed to body water loss. 
 
 === Extreme cases === 
 '''Cryptobiosis''' refers to the state of an organism that has no detectable [[Metabolism|metabolic]] activity, resulting from extreme and unfavorable environmental conditions.  < br / > '''Anhydrobiosis''' refers to the state of surviving the loss of (almost) all body water.

 ==== Rotifers ==== 
 [[Rotifers]] are specialists at living in [[habitat]]s where water dries up regularly.  
 
 The Monogononta, which have males, produce fertilised 'resting eggs' which can resist desiccation ([[drought]]) for long periods. < ref > Örstan A. 1995. Desiccation survival of the eggs of the rotifer ''Adineta vaga'' (Davis 1873). ''Hydrobiologia'' '''313/314''':373-375 < /ref >   
 
 The Bdelloids, who have no males, contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water, a process known as ''cryptobiosis''. Bdelloids can also survive the dry state for long periods: the longest well-documented dormancy is nine years. After they have dried, they may be revived by adding water. < ref > Kirk, Kevin L. et al. 1999. Physiological responses to variable environments: storage and respiration in starving rotifers.
