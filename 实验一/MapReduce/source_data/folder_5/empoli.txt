 Empoli has a long tradition as an agricultural centre. It has given its name to a local kind of [[artichoke]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Empoli was already settled in the time of the early [[Roman Empire]], and still existed in the 4th century AD. The river near the city was a good route for the trade of agricultural products, together with the local [[amphora]]e.  
 Since the 8th century Empoli grew as a town around the castle, known as ''Emporium'' or ''Empolis''. In [[1119]] it was controlled by [[Guidi]]. In [[1182|1182,]] it went under [[Florence|Florentine]] rule. In [[1260]], after the [[Battle of Montaperti]], Empoli was the seat of a famous [[council]] in which [[Farinata degli Uberti]] opposed the destruction of Florence. Later Empoli became an important [[fortress]]. 
 
 ==Important places and monuments== 
 *The ''Piazza Farinata degli Uberti'', also known as ''Piazza dei Leoni'' ( " Lions Square " ), in the middle there is a fountain by [[Luigi Pampaloni]] (1827). Here lies the ''[[Collegiata di Sant'Andrea]]'', the main city's monument. 
 *The ''Palazzo Ghibellino'' is the former palace of the Guidi counts. It was probably built in the 11th century.
