Its [[Capital (city)|capital]] is Columbus. [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] is also the largest [[city]] in Ohio. 
 
 Other large cities in Ohio are [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]. 
 
 Some famous people from Ohio include golfer [[:en:Jack Nicklaus|Jack Nicklaus]], [[Wilbur Wright|Wilbur]] and [[Orville Wright]], astronauts [[John Glenn]] and [[Neil Armstrong]], authors [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[Toni Morrison]], < ref > {{Cite web|last1=Yost|first1=Laina|last2=Woytach|first2=Carissa|date=2019-08-06|title='She treasured Lorain, we treasured her': Nobel laureate Toni Morrison dies at 88 (UPDATED/PHOTOS)|url=http://www.chroniclet.com/Local-News/2019/08/06/Lorain-native-Nobel-laureate-Toni-Morrison-dies-at-88.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807152442/http://www.chroniclet.com/Local-News/2019/08/06/Lorain-native-Nobel-laureate-Toni-Morrison-dies-at-88.html|archive-date=2019-08-07|access-date=2020-10-31|website=The Chronicle-Telegram}} < /ref >  and actors [[Clark Gable]] and [[Katie Holmes]]. There have also been seven American presidents from Ohio: [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Rutherford Hayes]], [[James Garfield]], [[Benjamin Harrison]], [[William McKinley]], [[William Howard Taft]], [[Warren G. Harding]]. 
 
 Ohio is important in elections because it is a swing state. Candidates often campaign a lot there and prior to [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]], the last time they voted for the losing candidate was [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. Also, no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] has ever won the presidency without carrying this state. Ohio has both farmland and cities, and there is a lot of discrimination against [[Black people|black]] people. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2019-10-10|title=Report: Segregation and discrimination plague Midwest|url=https://www.policymattersohio.org/press-room/2019/10/10/report-segregation-and-discrimination-plague-midwest|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Policy Matters Ohio|quote=Ohio, where 12.3% of residents are black, struggles in several key indicators. The state’s difference between the black and white [[unemployment]] rate is 5th largest in the nation. The gap between what Ohio employers pay white and black workers is larger than in all but 41 states. More than a quarter of black Ohioans who are poor live in high-[[poverty]] neighborhoods. In Cleveland and Dayton, concentrated poverty among black people exceeds 40%.}} < /ref >  It is a part of the [[Midwest]]. Ohio is the 8th most populated state in the United States of America. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Ohio borders [[Pennsylvania]], [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]], and it shares a water border with [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Western Ohio is mostly flat farmland, with some hills. Southern and Southeastern Ohio is near the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and is the most mountainous part of the state. Most of this area is covered by forests. This part of Ohio is home to the Ohio River, the Wayne National Forest, and the Hocking Hills, which has waterfalls and canyons. 
 
 Central Ohio is mostly rolling hills, and is home to Columbus. Northeast Ohio is dominated by the Lake Erie coast and has a mix of cities and countryside. 
 
 == Economy == 
 For many years, industry and manufacturing was the biggest part of Ohio's economy. [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] was a big steel producer, as was Cleveland. Other manufacturing - including the car industry - was a major factor across the state. Since the 1970s, industry has shrank in Ohio, but it is still a big part of the local economy. Today, other businesses are more prominent. Cleveland is one of the biggest hubs for Healthcare, and its main hospital, the famous [[Cleveland Clinic]], is the largest employer in the region. Banking is also a major business, and foods and retail are too. Cincinnati plays host to the headquarters of Fifth Third Bank, Cintas, [[Kroger]], Luxottica, [[Procter  &  Gamble]] and [[Macy's]], whereas, Columbus hosts the headquarters of LBrands, [[JPMorgan Chase]], Huntington Bank, Rogue Fitness, [[Wendy's]], Big Lots, Cardinal Health and Nationwide Insurance. In addition The J.M. Smucker Company and Key Bank are also based in Ohio.
