 '''Infrastructure''' is the term used to describe the facilities which support modern human life. 
 
 These are the main items: [[water]] supply, [[sewage]] plants, [[housing]], [[roads]], [[cable]] networks, [[food]] supply facilities, [[schools]], [[hospital]]s, [[airport]]s, community meeting places, business and government [[building]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[railway]]s. In fact, everything that modern life needs in the way of built facilities. 
 
 Infrastructure is closely connected with [[standard of living]] and [[overpopulation]].  More people will want more roads, water pipes and other infrastructure. [[Poor]] countries tend to have fast population growth and cannot provide the needed infrastructure. Standard of living drops and this may lead to other problems like worsening health, exposure to plague and difficult access of emergency units to those that need it.
