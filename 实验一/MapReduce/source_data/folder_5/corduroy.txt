 '''Corduroy''' is a strong [[fabric]]. It is made of twisted [[fiber]]s. When woven, the fibers are parallel to one another in ridges. This makes the corduroy look striped. Corduroy is used to make [[clothing]], including [[trousers]], [[jacket]]s and [[shirt]]s. It is also used for [[furniture]], including [[couch]]es. 
 
 The ridges in the fabric are called  " wales " . < ref > {{cite web|author=Daniel Billett|title=Wale|url=http://mensfashion.about.com/od/dressingforyourbodytype/g/Wale.htm|access-date=2007-11-11|work=About.com|archive-date=2007-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127085605/http://mensfashion.about.com/od/dressingforyourbodytype/g/Wale.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Corduroy can have from 1.5 to 21 wales per inch. It usually has between 10 and 12 wales per inch. Corduroy with fewer wales per inch is more often used to make trousers and for furniture. Corduroy with more wales per inch is usually used for clothing worn above the [[waist]]. 
 
 Some people think the word ''corduroy'' comes from the French words ''corde du roi'' (''the cord of the King''). There is no evidence that this is true. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=corduroy & searchmode=term|access-date=2012-05-26|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}} < /ref >
