:''For the technology of putting many hard drives together, see [[RAID]]'' 
 A '''raid''' is an [[:wikt:attack|attack]] into [[enemy]] [[territory]] with no intent to get control of it. For example, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was an [[air raid]]. 
 
 The attackers go away immediately after the attack. Most raids are brief and performed by a small number of people.
