'''Horlicks''' is a sweet [[Malt|malted]] milk hot drink powder.   
 
 It was first made in America in 1873 as an artificial [[infant]] food.  Later it was sold as a powdered meal replacement drink for people who couldnt eat properly.  It is now sold as a [[Nutrition|nutritional]] supplement and is manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].  In the United Kingdom it is made with a mixture of [[wheat flour]] and malted wheat (46%), and malted [[barley]] (26%).  In different countries it may be made and advertised differently.  < ref > {{Cite web|title=Collections|url=https://www.horlicks.co.uk/collections|access-date=2023-05-20|website=www.horlicks.co.uk|language=en}} < /ref >
