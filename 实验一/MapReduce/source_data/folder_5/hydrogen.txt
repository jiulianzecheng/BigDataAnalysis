{{Infobox hydrogen}} 
 '''Hydrogen''' is a [[chemical element]] at the start of the [[periodic table]]. It has the [[symbol]] '''H''' and [[atomic number]] 1. It also has a [[Relative atomic mass|standard atomic weight]] of 1.008, which makes it the lightest element in the periodic table. 
 
 Hydrogen is the most common chemical element in the [[Universe]], making up 75% of all normal ([[baryon|baryonic]]) [[matter]] (by [[mass]]). Most [[star]]s are made of mostly hydrogen. Hydrogen's most common [[isotope]] has one [[proton]] with one [[electron]] [[Atomic orbital|orbiting]] around it. 
 
 == Properties == 
 Hydrogen is grouped as a [[Nonmetal|reactive nonmetal]], unlike the other elements found in the first [[:wikt:column|column]] of the periodic table, which are grouped as [[alkali metal]]s. The solid form of hydrogen should behave like a metal, though. 
 
 When by itself, hydrogen normally [[chemical bond|binds]] with itself to make '''dihydrogen''' (H < sub > 2 < /sub > ) which is very [[:wikt:stable|stable]], because of its high [[bond-dissociation energy]] of 435.7 kJ/mol. < ref > {{cite book

 }} < /ref >  At normal [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], this hydrogen gas (H < sub > 2 < /sub > ) has no color, smell, or taste and is not poisonous as it is a nonmetal and burns very easily. 
 
 === Combustion === 
 [[Molecule|Molecular]] hydrogen is [[:wikt:flammable|flammable]] and [[Chemical reaction|reacts]] with [[oxygen]]: 
 
 2 H < sub > 2 < /sub > (g) + O < sub > 2 < /sub > (g) → 2 H < sub > 2 < /sub > O(l) + 572 kJ (286 kJ/mol) 
 
 At temperatures higher than 500 °[[Celsius|C]], hydrogen suddenly burns in air. {{cn|date=August 2023}} 
 
 === Compounds === 
 While hydrogen [[gas]] in its natural form is not [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], it does form [[Chemical compound|compounds]] with many elements, especially [[halogen]]s, which are very [[Electronegativity|electronegative]], meaning they want an [[electron]] very badly. Hydrogen also forms massive [[:wikt:array|arrays]] with [[carbon]] [[atom]]s, forming [[hydrocarbon]]s. The [[:wikt:study|study]] of the properties of hydrocarbons is known as [[organic chemistry]]. 
 
 The H < sup > - < /sup >  [[anion]] (negatively [[Electric charge|charged]] atom) is named a [[hydride]], though the word is not commonly used. An example of a hydride is [[lithium hydride]] (LiH), which is used as a  " [[spark plug]] "  in [[nuclear weapons]]. 
 
 === Acids === 
 [[Acid]]s [[Dissolution|dissolved]] in water normally [[:wikt:contain|contain]] high levels of hydrogen [[ion]]s, in other words, free [[proton]]s. Their level is generally used to [[:wikt:determine|determine]] its [[pH]], that is, the [[:wikt:content|content]] of hydrogen ions in a volume. For example, [[hydrochloric acid]], found in people's stomachs, can [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into a [[chloride]] anion and a free proton, and the property of the free proton is how it can digest food by [[Corrosion|corroding]] it. 
 
 Though uncommon on Earth, the H < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > + < /sup >  [[cation]] is one of the most common ions in the universe. 
 
 === Isotopes === 
 {{main|Isotopes of hydrogen}} 
 Hydrogen has 7 known isotopes, two of which are stable ( < sup > 1 < /sup > H and  < sup > 2 < /sup > H), which are commonly named [[protium]] and [[deuterium]]. The isotope  < sup > 3 < /sup > H is known as [[tritium]], has a [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of 12.33 years, and is produced in small amounts by [[cosmic ray]]s. The 4 isotopes left have half-lives on the scale of [[Orders of magnitude (time)#Seconds|yoctoseconds]]. 
 
 == Hydrogen in nature == 
 In its natural form on Earth, hydrogen is generally a [[gas]]. Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a [[water]] molecule. Hydrogen is important because it is the [[fuel]] that powers the [[Sun]] and other stars. 
 Hydrogen makes up about 74% of the complete [[universe]]. < ref name= " ut " > {{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser, ''Universe Today''|title=When was the first light in the universe?|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-11-universe.html|publisher=Phys.org|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=November 7, 2016|archive-date=18 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218150639/http://phys.org/news/2016-11-universe.html|url-status=live}} < /ref >   
 
 Natural hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen [[atom]]s connected together. Scientists name these [[diatomic molecules]]. Hydrogen will have a [[chemical reaction]] when mixed with most other elements, though it has no [[color]] or [[Odor|smell]]. 
 
 Natural hydrogen is very uncommon in the [[Earth]]'s [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], because nearly all [[wikt:en:primordial|primordial]] hydrogen would have [[:wikt:escape|escaped]] into space because of its weight. In nature, it is generally in [[water]]. Hydrogen is also in all living things, as a part of the [[organic compound]]s that living things are made of. In addition, hydrogen atoms can join with [[carbon]] atoms to form [[hydrocarbon]]s. [[Petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuel]]s are made of these hydrocarbons and commonly used to make [[energy]].

 == History of Hydrogen == 
 Hydrogen was first separated in 1671 by [[Robert Boyle]]. < ref > Boyle, R. (1672).  " Tracts written by the Honourable Robert Boyle containing new experiments, touching the relation betwixt flame and air... "  London. < /ref >  In 1776, [[Henry Cavendish]] [[:wikt:identify|identified]] it as its own [[Elementary particle|element]] and named it  " inflammable air " . He saw in 1781 that burning it made water. < ref > Boyle, R. (1672).  " Tracts written by the Honourable Robert Boyle containing new experiments, touching the relation betwixt flame and air...

 == Uses of Hydrogen == 
 The most common uses are in the [[petroleum]] industry and in making [[ammonia]] by the [[Haber process]]. Some is used in other places in the [[Chemical substance|chemical]] industry. A little of it is used as [[fuel]], for example in [[rocket]]s for [[spacecraft]]. Most of the hydrogen that people use comes from a [[chemical reaction]] between [[natural gas]] and [[steam]]. 
 
 === Nuclear fusion === 
 
 [[Nuclear fusion]] is a very powerful [[:wikt:source|source]] of [[energy]]. It depends on forcing [[atom]]s together to make [[helium]] and energy, as in a [[star]] like the [[Sun]], or in a [[Nuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]]. This needs a large amount of energy to get started, and is not easy to do currently. A big [[:wikt:advantage|advantage]] over [[nuclear fission]], which is used in today's [[nuclear power]] stations, is that it makes less nuclear waste and does not use a poisonous and uncommon [[fuel]] like [[uranium]]. More than 600 million [[ton]]s of hydrogen undergo fusion every second on the Sun. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/sci/whatisfusion |title=What is Fusion? |first= |last= |work=iter.org |year=2012 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |publisher=ITER Organization |archive-date=6 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306200347/http://www.iter.org/sci/whatisfusion |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html|title=NASA's Cosmicopia|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 February 2013|archive-date=6 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106095009/http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 === Using hydrogen === 
 Hydrogen is mostly used in the petroleum industry, to change heavy petroleum parts into lighter, more useful ones. It is also used to make [[ammonia]]. Smaller amounts are burned as fuel. Most hydrogen is made by a reaction between [[natural gas]] and [[steam]]. 
 
 The [[electrolysis of water]] breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen, using electricity. Burning hydrogen joins with oxygen molecules to make [[steam]] (natural water vapor). A [[fuel cell]] joins hydrogen with an oxygen [[molecule]], [[:wikt:release|releasing]] an electron as electricity. For these reasons, many people believe hydrogen power will replace other [[synthetic fuel]]s in the future. 
 
 Hydrogen can also be burned to make heat for [[steam turbine]]s or [[internal combustion engine]]s. Like other synthetic fuels, hydrogen can be made from natural fuels such as [[coal]] or natural gas, or from electricity, and therefore represents a valuable addition to the [[Electric power transmission|power grid]]; in the same [[:wikt:role|role]] as [[natural gas]]. Such a grid and [[:wikt:infrastructure|infrastructure]] with [[fuel cell vehicle]]s is now [[:wikt:plan|planned]] by a number of countries, such as Japan, Korea and many European countries. This lets these countries [[:wikt:buy|buy]] less [[petroleum]], which is an [[:wikt:economic|economic]] advantage. The other advantage is that, used in a fuel cell or burned in a combustion engine as in a [[hydrogen car]], the engine does not make [[pollution]]. Only water, and a small amount of [[nitrogen oxide]]s, forms.
