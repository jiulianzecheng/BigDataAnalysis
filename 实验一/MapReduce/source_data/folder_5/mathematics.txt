 '''Mathematics''' is the study of [[number]]s, [[shape]]s, and [[pattern]]s. The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''μάθημα'' (máthema), meaning  " [[science]], [[knowledge]], or [[learning]] " , and is sometimes shortened to '''math''' or '''maths'''. 
 
 It is the study of: 
 * [[Numbers]]: including how things can be [[Counting|counted]]. 
 * [[Structure]]: including how things are [[organization|organized]], but also how they can be or could have been. This subfield is usually called [[algebra]]. 
 * Place: where things are, and spatial arrangement, including arrangements of spaces themselves. This subfield is usually called [[geometry]]. 
 * Change: how things become different. This subfield is usually called [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. 
 
 [[Applied math]] is useful for solving problems in the real world. People working in [[business]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[construction]] use mathematics. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.siam.org/Students-Education/Programs-Initiatives/Thinking-of-a-Career-in-Applied-Mathematics|title=Thinking of a Career in Applied Mathematics? {{!}} SIAM|website=www.siam.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Wigner|first=Eugene|date=February 1960|title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html|journal=Communications in Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102|bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W|s2cid=6112252 |via=|access-date=2018-08-07|archive-date=2018-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810073503/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Problem-solving in mathematics == 
 Mathematics solves problems by using [[logic]]. One of the main tools of logic used by mathematicians is [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]. Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true (called a [[Proof (mathematics)|proof]]) is just as important as the fact that it is true, and this reason is often found using deduction. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of scientific thinking, which might rely on [[experiment]]s or on [[interview]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-05}} < /ref > 
 
 Logic and reasoning are used by mathematicians to create general [[rule]]s, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out [[information]] that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics solves many [[problem]]s at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2016/08/21/role-generalization-advanced-mathematical-thinking/|title=The Role of Generalization in the Advanced Mathematical Thinking|date=2016-08-21|work=AMS Grad Blog|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-US}} < /ref >  These rules can be called [[theorem]]s (if they have been proven) or [[conjecture]]s (if it is not known if they are true yet). < ref > {{Cite book|title=How to Think Like a Mathematician|url=https://archive.org/details/howtothinklikema00hous_005|last=Houston|first=Kevin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtothinklikema00hous_005/page/n112 99]|isbn=978-0-521-71978-0}} < /ref >  Most mathematicians use non-logical and creative reasoning in order to find a logical proof. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Thurston|first=William|date=April 1994|title=On proof and progress in mathematics|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=30|issue=2|pages=161–177|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1994-00502-6|arxiv=math/9404236|bibcode=1994math......4236T}} < /ref > 
 
 Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are [[choice|chosen]] because they are considered simple or neat. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us [[knowledge|understand]] the world better. Some examples of math problems are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, calculus, fractions and decimals. [[Algebra]] problems are solved by evaluating certain [[variable]]s. A [[calculator]] answers every math problem in the four basic [[arithmetic]] operations. 
 
 == Areas of study in mathematics == 
 
 === Number === 
 :Mathematics includes the study of numbers and quantities. It is a branch of science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity, and arrangement. Most of the areas listed below are studied in many different fields of mathematics, including [[set theory]] and [[mathematical logic]]. The study of [[number theory]] usually focuses more on the structure and behavior of the integers rather than on the actual foundations of numbers themselves, and so is not listed in this given subsection.
