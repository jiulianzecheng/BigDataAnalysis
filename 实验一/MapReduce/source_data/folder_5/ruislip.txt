'''Ruislip''' is a town on the northwest side of [[Greater London]]. It was in [[Middlesex]] until that county was abolished in 1965. It owes its present population to the [[Metropolitan Railway]], built early in the 20th century. After that was built many Londoners moved out to places along the line. 
 
 Ruislip is now served by five stations on the [[London Underground]] network. These are: 
 * Ruislip: [[Metropolitan line|Metropolitan]] and [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]] lines 
 * Ruislip Manor: [[Metropolitan line|Metropolitan]] and [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]] lines 
 * South Ruislip: [[Central line]] 
 * West Ruislip: [[Central line]] 
 * Ruislip Gardens: [[Central line]] 
 
 Ruislip Lido is well known in the area. It has a small railway line that runs between two stations around the lake as well as a small beach that hosts some children's play equipment.
