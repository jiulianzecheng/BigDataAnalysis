 '''Wheathampstead''' is a village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] north of [[St Albans]]. It is part of the City and District of [[St Albans]], in [[Hertfordshire]]. Its [[parliament]]ary constituency is [[Hitchin and Harpenden]]. The village is on the River Lea (or Lee), a [[tributary]] of the [[Thames]]. 
 
 The population of Wheathampstead at the time of the 2001 [[United Kingdom Census 2001|census]] was 6,058. 
 
 ==History== 
 Settlements in this area were made about 50 [[BC]] by [[Belgae|Belgic]] invaders. They moved up the rivers [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Lea|Lea]] from what is now [[Belgium]]. Evidence for them was found in [[Devil's Dyke, Hertfordshire|Devil's Dyke]], at the eastern side of Wheathampstead. 
 
 The Devil's Dyke earthworks are remains of an ancient settlement of the [[Catuvellauni]]. It is thought to have been the tribe's original capital. The capital was moved to Verlamion, later the Roman [[Verulamium]]. This became the modern St Albans. 
 
 The Devil's Dyke is reputedly where [[Julius Caesar]] defeated [[Cassivellaunus]] in 54 BC, although this claim is disputed. The Dyke may have been part of the same defensive rampart as nearby [[Beech Bottom Dyke]]. If correct, this would make the area one of the largest and most important British [[Iron Age]] settlements. 
 
 Later, the village is recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] under name ''Watamestede''. It appears that a church existed at Wheathampstead before the [[Norman Conquest]], as Wheathampstead was given by [[Edward the Confessor]] to [[Westminster Abbey]]. The original structure was demolished in the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], and the oldest part of the present church dates to about 1280. < ref > [http://www.wheathampstead.net/sthhisst.htm The history of St. Helen's Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709232437/http://www.wheathampstead.net/sthhisst.htm |date=2006-07-09 }}, Wheathampstead < /ref >  The main doorways to the church (in the chancel section) and the windows are [[Early English architecture|Early English]] pointed arches.
