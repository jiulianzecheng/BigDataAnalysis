 '''Antacids''' (or indigestion tablets) are used to help stop [[indigestion]]. < ref name= " healthline " > {{cite web |last=Hoskins |first=Julia |title=Antacids |url=https://www.healthline.com/health/antacids |work=Healthline |date=15 January 2013 |access-date=9 July 2018}} < /ref >  People may get indigestion if they eat too much or if they eat too fast. With indigestion, the liquid in the [[stomach]] will become more acidic. Antacids will neutralise the acids. The reaction that is happening is called ''neutralisation''. This is because the tablets are alkaline and the liquids in the stomach are acidic. 
 
 This reaction between the stomach acids and the antacid will make the acid change into harmless substances such as water or salt. 
 
 An example of an antacid is [[magnesium hydroxide|milk of magnesia]]. 
 
 Side effects from taking antacids are rare, but can include both [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]]. < ref name= " healthline " / >  They are also high in [[sodium]] so people with a heart condition on a low salt diet should ask their doctor before taking them. < ref name= " healthline " / >
