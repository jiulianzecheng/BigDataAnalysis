 In [[radio]], '''longwave''' (or long wave) refers to parts of the radio [[wikt:spectrum|spectrum]] that has longer [[wavelength]]s. These are typically [[kilometer]]-sized or greater. < ref name= " MacMillan " > {{cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = long wave  | work = MacMillan Online Dictionary  | publisher = MacMillan Publishers  | year = 2009  | url = http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/long-wave  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate =13 November 2014}} < /ref >  The term is a [[History|historic]] one dating from the early [[20th century]]. This was when the radio spectrum was considered to consist of long, medium and short wavelengths. Most modern radio systems and devices use wavelengths which would then have been called 'ultra-short'. For radio broadcasting is it the radio band between 30 kHz-299 & nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]]. 
 
 Longwaves have the advantage that [[diffraction]] helps them travel far.
