{{enWiktionary|lyrics}} 
 '''Lyrics''' are the words to a [[song]]. A person who writes lyrics is called a lyricist. 
 
 The lyrics of a song will usually have a meaning. Some times the meaning is easy to find but other times it can be very [[wikt:difficult|difficult]] to know what the lyrics mean. Some lyrics are so strange that it is nearly impossible to understand them. In such cases, people tend to look more at the [[form]], [[articulation]], [[meter (poetry)|meter]], and [[symmetries]] of the lyrics instead of looking at their meaning. 
 
 There are many [[website]]s that have the lyrics to songs. This may be a bad thing since many web sites include [[copyright]]ed lyrics without permission from the copyright holder. The [[United States]] [[Music Publishers' Association]] (MPA), which represents [[sheet music]] [[company|companies]], created a [[campaign]] against such sites in December 2005. MPA president [[Lauren Keiser]] said that the sites are  " completely illegal "  and that he wanted to see some site operators put in [[prison]]. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4508158.stm  " Song sites face legal crackdown " ] BBC News, 12 December 2005.

 The word ''lyric'' was used for the  " words of a popular song "  about [[1876]] [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lyric] for the first time. The plural ''lyrics'' was used only in referring to the words of several songs. That it is used for the words of a single song as its ''lyrics'' became increasingly common (probably because of the association between ''lyrics'' and the plural form ''words''), and is common in modern usage of today's society. Use of the singular form ''lyric'' is still grammatically acceptable.
