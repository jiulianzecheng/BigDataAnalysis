 '''Cyanotype''' is a [[photography|photographic]] printing process, which produces prints that are blue. [[John Herschel]] discovered the process in 1842. [[Engineer]]s used the process well into the 20th century as a simple and low-cost process to produce copies of drawings, referred to as [[blueprint]]s. The process uses two chemicals: [[Ammonium ferric citrate|ammonium iron(III) citrate]] and [[potassium ferricyanide]].
