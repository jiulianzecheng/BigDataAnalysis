 ==Etymology== 
 The name ''Kansas'' comes from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] term, ''Akansa'', for the [[Quapaw]] people. These were a [[Dhegiha Siouan]]-speaking people who moved to [[Arkansas]] around the 13th century. The stem -''kansa'' is named after the [[Kaw people]]. They are also known as the ''Kansa'', a federally recognized Native American tribe. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Bright|first=William|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53019644|title=Native American placenames of the United States|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3576-X|location=Norman|pages=47|oclc=53019644}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 {{main article|History of Kansas}} 
 ===Early history=== 
 In 1539, [[Marcos de Niza]], a [[friar]], < ref name= " 1892.698 " > {{harvnb|Ingalls|1892|p=698}} < /ref >  reported [[wikt:rumor|rumors]] of [[Quivira and Cíbola|Cíbola]], a city of gold, to Spanish colonial officials in [[Mexico City]]. Niza said the city was in modern-day [[New Mexico]]. < ref name= " Nat_Geo " > {{cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/seven-cities-of-cibola/|title=Seven Cities of Cibola Legend Lures Conquistadors|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=December 17, 2011|archive-date=December 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202040235/http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/seven-cities-of-cibola|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In response to the rumors, two years later, [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]], with an army of 3000 [[Spain|Spaniards]] and 8001 [[Mexico|Mexicans]], marched northward from [[Culiacán]] in hopes of finding the city. When Coronado did not find the city in New Mexico, he continued northeast into the [[Mississippi Valley]], crossing the present area of Kansas [[diagonal]]ly. This made Conrado and his army the first Europeans to see the [[Great Plains]], including Kansas. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/colonialhouse/history/1628_plains.html|title=1862 Across the Continent|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=December 17, 2011}} < /ref >  Later, [[Juan de Oñate]] also traveled to Kansas in 1601. < ref name= " 1892.698 "  / > 
 
 In 1682, [[Jacques Marquette]], [[Louis Jolliet]], [[Louis Hennepin]] and other [[France|French]] leaders took [[wikt:formal|formal]] control of the Mississippi Valley, including the land that would become Kansas. This land, known as the Louisiana [[territory]], was used to organize trade with [[Native American]]s. In 1763, France [[cede]]d the Louisiana territory to Spain. 
 
 Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into the Spanish [[Louisiana]]. The governor [[Luis de Unzaga]] 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the [[Native American|indians]] tribes, among the explorers were [[Antoine de Marigny]] and others who continued trading across the [[Kansas River]], especially at its confluence with the [[Missouri River]], tributaries of the [[Mississippi River]]. < ref > Cazorla, Frank, G.

 However, in 1803, Spain receded the territory back to France in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. < ref name= " 1892.698 "  / >  On April 30, 1803, [[Napoleon]] sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. < ref name= " 1892.698 "  / > < ref > {{harvnb|Winas|1902|p=7}} < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Larned|1894|p=1936}} < /ref >  In the early 1800s, Kansas was used to hold [[Native American]]s that were removed from their [[wikt:native|native]] lands. < ref name= " Hist "  / > 
 
 ===Statehood=== 
 On May 30, 1854, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] signed the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. The Kansas-Nebraska Act stated that Kansas and [[Nebraska]] were both [[territory|territories]] of the United States. < ref > {{cite book| last = Wishart| first = David J.| title = Encyclopedia of the Great Plains| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC| accessdate = January 2, 2010| year = 2004| publisher = University of Nebraska Press| isbn = 978-0-8032-4787-1| page = 670 }} < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Ingalls|1892|pp=699–700}} < /ref >  It also stated that Kansans would vote on the [[wikt:legality|legality]] of slavery. < ref name= " BK "  / > 
 
 Upon hearing this, about 1,200 armed [[New England]]ers came to Kansas to vote against slavery. However, thousands of southerners, mostly from [[Missouri]], came to vote for slavery. < ref name= " BK " > {{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2952.html |title=Bleeding Kansas |work=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=January 3, 2011}} < /ref >  The final vote was to make slavery legal, and Kansas adopted most of Missouri's slave laws. There was fighting between Southerners and Northerners in Kansas. In one fight, [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his men killed five people in the Pottawatomie Massacre. Later, Southerners destroyed Lawrence, Kansas. Kansas was called  " Bleeding Kansas " . 
 
 Between 1854 and 1861, Kansas proposed four state [[constitution]]s. Out of the four proposed constitutions, three did not allow slavery. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.kshs.org/p/online-exhibits-willing-to-die-for-freedom-constitutions/15396 |title=Online Exhibits - Willing to Die for Freedom, Constitutions - Kansas Historical Society |work=kshs.org |year=2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}} < /ref >  Finally, in July 1859, Kansas passed the [[Wyandotte Constitution]], which was anti-slavery. < ref > {{harvnb|Winas|1902|p=8}} < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Larned|1894|p=1937}} < /ref >  The constitution for statehood was sent to the U.S. government in April 1860 to be voted on.

In 1861, after the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states formed, the constitution gained approval from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and Kansas became a state. < ref name= " Hist " > {{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jan29.html |title=Today in History: January 29 |work=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=January 5, 2011}} < /ref > < ref name= " BK "  / > < ref name= " Page9 "  / > < ref > {{harvnb|Ingalls|1892|p=705}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Kansas in the Civil War=== 
 {{main article|Kansas in the American Civil War}}

 ===Post Civil War=== 
 After the Civil War, many free slaves came to Oklahoma and Kansas. In fact, between the years of 1879 and 1881, about 60,000 African Americans came to this region. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/donner-west-article/ |title=General Article: Call of the West |work=Public Broadcasting Station |accessdate=January 17, 2011}} < /ref > < ref name= " Migration.L " > {{cite web|url= https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam008.html|title=Migrations: The African-American Mosaic (Library of Congress Exhibition)|work=loc.gov|date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 23, 2011}} < /ref >  This is because the slaves wanted [[wikt:economic|economic]] opportunities, which they believed awaited them in Kansas.

 Kansas is the 15th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of 82,282 square miles (213,109 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup > ). Of this, about 462 square miles (1196.57 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup > ) are water. This makes up 0.60% of the total area of the state. < ref name= " Water " > {{cite web |url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/wetstates.html |title=How much of your state is wet? |work=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=January 14, 2011 |archive-date=April 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407142636/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/wetstates.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Kansas shares borders with [[Nebraska]] to the north, [[Oklahoma]] to the south, [[Missouri]] to the east, and [[Colorado]] to the west. Kansas is just as far away from the [[Pacific Ocean]] as it is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The geographic center of the main 48 states is near [[Lebanon, Kansas]]. < ref name=doigs > {{cite web|title=Geographical Centers of the United States|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/unnumbered/70039437/report.pdf|website=USGS Publications Warehouse|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior Geological Survey|accessdate=13 May 2015|date=1964}} < /ref >  The geographic center of Kansas is in [[Barton County, Kansas|Barton County]]. 
 
 ===Geology=== 
 The underground of Kansas is made of [[Dip slope|dipping]] [[sedimentary rock]]s, and they are slightly slanted west. A series of [[Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian]], and [[Permian]] rocks are found in the eastern and southern parts of the state. In the western part of Kansas, [[Cretaceous]] can be found sticking up from the ground. This happened because of the [[erosion]] from the [[Orogeny|geologically uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] west of Kansas. Northeastern Kansas was affected by [[glaciation]] during the [[Pleistocene]]. 
 
 ===Topography=== 
 All of Kansas is in the Great Plains, < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.unl.edu/plains/about/map.shtml |title=UNL  & #124; Map of the Great Plains |work=unl.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}} < /ref >  where the land is mostly flat with [[prairie]]s and [[grassland]]s. Eastern Kansas has hills and forests, like the [[Flint Hills]] and the [[Osage Plains]] in the southeastern part of the state. 
 
 Kansas increases in elevation from east to west. The highest place in the state is [[Mount Sunflower]] near the Colorado border. Mount Sunflower is 4,039 & nbsp;ft (1,231 & nbsp;m) tall. The lowest point is the Verdigris River in [[Montgomery County, Kansas|Montgomery County]], at 679 & nbsp;ft (207 & nbsp;m) above sea level. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state – in 2003, a [[tongue-in-cheek]] study famously said the state is  " flatter than a [[pancake]] " . < ref > {{cite web |url = http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i3/kansas.html |title = Kansas Is Flatter Than a Pancake |publisher = Improbable.com |accessdate = July 31, 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100730133707/http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i3/kansas.html |archivedate = July 30, 2010 |df = mdy-all }} < /ref >  Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of {{convert|3360|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{cite web|url = https://www.infoplease.com/world/united-states-geography/highest-lowest-and-mean-elevations-united-states |title = Highest, Lowest, and Mean Elevations in the United States |publisher = infoplease.com | accessdate = May 20, 2018}} < /ref >  This makes Kansas the 23rd flattest U.S. state. < ref > {{cite web |url = http://www.geotimes.org/oct03/NN_pancake.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040124015708/http://www.geotimes.org/oct03/NN_pancake.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = January 24, 2004 |title = Fracas over Kansas pancake flap |publisher = Geotimes.org |accessdate = July 31, 2010 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Rivers=== 
 [[File:Spring River 2006-07-03 2104.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spring River (Missouri)|Spring River]], Kansas]] 
 
 About {{convert|75|mi|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} of the Kansas's northeastern border is the [[Missouri River]]. The [[Kansas River]] is created by the [[junction]] of the [[Smoky Hill River]] and [[Republican River]]. This happens at [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]]. The Kansas River then joins the Missouri River at [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]]. It goes {{convert|170|mi|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} across the northeastern part of the state. 
 
 The [[Arkansas River]] ([[Arkansas River#Pronunciations|pronunciation varies]]) starts in [[Colorado]]. It goes for about {{convert|500|mi|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} across the western and southern parts of Kansas. 
 
 Kansas's has other rivers. There is the [[Saline River (Kansas)|Saline River]] and the [[Solomon River (Kansas)|Solomon River]]. They are [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Smoky Hill River. The [[Big Blue River (Kansas)|Big Blue River]], the [[Delaware River (Kansas)|Delaware River]], and the [[Wakarusa River]] flow into the Kansas River. The [[Marais des Cygnes River]] is a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is between [[Riverton, Kansas|Riverton]] and [[Baxter Springs, Kansas|Baxter Springs]].

 ==Weather== 
 [[File:Kansas Köppen.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types in Kansas]]

 [[File:Wea00214 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A [[tornado]] in Manhattan, Kansas]] 
 
 The [[Köppen climate classification]] says that Kansas's climate has three types depending on where in the state it is: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern 2/3 of the state (especially the northeastern part) has a [[humid continental climate]]. This means it has cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the [[precipitation]] happens during both the summer and the spring. 
 
 The western 1/3 of the state – from about [[U.S. Route 83]] to west of it – has a [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters vary a lot. Winters can be anything between warm and very cold. The western region gets an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|°F|°C|abbr=off}} range. 
 
 The far south-central and southeastern parts of Kansas, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]]. This means it has hot and humid summers, and it has milder winters. It also has more precipitation than other places in Kansas. Some things about three climates can be found in most of Kansas. Many parts can get [[drought]]s and varied weather. Places can be dry or humid. Places can get both warm or cold in the winter. 
 
 Temperatures in many areas in the western half of Kansas reach {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=}} or hotter on most days of June, July, and August. Because of the high humidity, the [[heat index]] can be deadly, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often high in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature. 
 
 Temperatures of {{convert|100|°F|°C}} or higher are not as common in the eastern half of Kansas. However, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect make most summer days reach between {{convert|107|°F|°C}} and {{convert|114|°F|°C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, the low temperatures each night in the northeastern part of the state don't get colder than {{convert|80|°F|°C}} very often. Also, because of the humidity being between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat can be felt all day. 
 
 Kansas has a [[wikt:varied|varied]] [[climate]] with an average yearly temperature of 56°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (13°[[Celsius|C]]). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.kansas.gov/kdem/pdf/library/2008%20KRP.pdf |title=Kansas Response Plan 2008 |date=October 2007 |work=kansas.gov |page=14 |accessdate=January 31, 2011}} < /ref >  The highest temperature ever in Kansas is 121 & nbsp;°F (49.4 & nbsp;°C). This happened in [[Fredonia, Kansas|Fredonia]] on July 18, 1936, and in [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] on July 24, 1936. The lowest temperature ever in Kansas is -40 & nbsp;°F (-40 & nbsp;°C). This occurred in [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] on February 13, 1905. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ict/?n=ksrecords |title=Kansas Climate Records - WFO Wichita, Kansas |work=crh.noaa.gov |year=2011 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}} < /ref >  Kansas is in a [[temperate]] area of the country. Like other states in this region, Kansas has four [[wikt:distinct|distinct]] seasons. 
 
 Kansas can have [[wikt:extreme|extreme]] [[weather]] in all four seasons. For example, in spring and autumn, Kansas has many tornadoes. In fact, Kansas gets about 55 tornadoes per year. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/avgt5304.gif |title=Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953-2004 |work=ncdc.noaa.gov |accessdate=January 21, 2011 |archive-date=May 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508204818/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/avgt5304.gif |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This is because Kansas is in the area known as [[Tornado Alley]], where cold and warm [[air mass]]es come together to make [[wikt:severe|severe]] weather. 
 
 In summer, Kansas has [[wikt:experienced|experienced]] severe [[drought]]s. For example, in 1934, 1936, and 1939, Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread [[dust storm]]s as a part of the [[Dust Bowl]]. < ref > {{cite web

 ===Energy=== 
 Kansas has many [[renewable resource]]s. Kansas is one of the biggest [[producer]]s of [[wind power]] in the United States. In 2019, Kansas had an [[installed capacity]] of about 6,100 & nbsp;[[Megawatts]] & nbsp;(MW) from about 3,200 [[wind turbine]]s. Wind produced the [[List of power stations in Kansas|biggest amount of electricity]] from the state at 41%. An additional 700 & nbsp;MW of capacity was scheduled to become available during 2020. Kansas is also one of the biggest national producers of renewable [[ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] fuels; Kansas produces about 600 & nbsp;million gallons per year. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=KS |title=Kansas State Energy Profile Analysis |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=2021-04-01}} < /ref > 
 
 Kansas is eighth in [[Petroleum in the United States|US petroleum extraction]]. Production has slowly lowered because Kansas's limited economical reserves (especially from the [[Anadarko Basin]]) are being used up. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] reached their lowest level in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained about the same; it had an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon sequestration|carbon dioxide sequestration]] and other oil recovery techniques more economical. 
 
 Kansas is also eighth in US natural gas production. Production has slowly lowered since the mid-1990s with the slow depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]—the state's biggest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.
