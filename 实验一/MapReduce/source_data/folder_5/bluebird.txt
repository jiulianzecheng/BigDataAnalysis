 The '''bluebirds''' are a group of medium-sized, mostly [[insectivorous]] or omnivorous [[Passerine]] [[bird]]s. They are in the [[genus]] ''Sialia'' of the [[thrush (bird)|thrush]] family (Turdidae).  
 
 Bluebirds are one of the few thrush genera in the [[Americas]]. They have blue, or blue and rose beige, [[plumage]]. Female birds are less brightly colored than males, although color patterns are similar and there is no noticeable difference in size between the two sexes. 
 
 Bluebirds are territorial and prefer open [[grassland]] with scattered trees. [[Predators]] of young bluebirds in the nests may include [[snakes]], [[cats]], and [[raccoon]]s. Bird species competing with bluebirds for nesting locations include the common [[starling]], American [[crow]], and [[house sparrow]]s. House sparrows take over the nesting sites of bluebirds, killing young, smashing eggs, and probably killing adult bluebirds. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v055n03/p0378-p0380.pdf |title=House sparrows kill eastern bluebirds |jstor=4512922|author=Gowaty, Patricia Adair |journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|volume =55|issue=3|year=1984|pages=378â€“380}} < /ref >
