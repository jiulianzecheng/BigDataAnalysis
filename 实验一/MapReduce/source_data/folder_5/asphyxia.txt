 '''Asphyxia''' or '''asphyxiation''' is a condition when a living body does not get enough [[oxygen]]. If this condition lasts long enough it can lead to [[unconsciousness]], [[brain]] damage and [[death]]. 
 
 Asphyxia can injure or [[death|kill]] people. This sometimes happens during [[suicide]], [[torture]], and in [[warfare]]. It can also be used as a [[capital punishment]]. It is also sometimes used non[[fatal]]ly in [[martial arts]], [[combat]] [[sports]], and in some types of sex play. Because the need to breathe is controlled by the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[blood]], some victims may not experience an urgent need to breathe and may remain unaware of the shortage of oxygen in their body.
