 A '''cataract''' is when the [[lens (eye)|lens]] of the [[eye]] gets cloudy. It is a [[treatable medical condition]]. Cataracts can cause short-sightedness ([[myopia]]), which means you cannot see things in the distance but can see things up close. 
 
 If not fixed by [[surgery]], some types of cataracts will cause [[blindness]] (which means you cannot see anything at all). In a simple [[operation]], the old lens can be replaced by a new plastic one. Many thousands of people have had this operation.
