 '''Yogurt''', or '''yoghurt''' is a [[dairy product|milk product]] made by [[bacteria]]l [[fermentation]] of milk. The [[lactose]] in the milk becomes [[lactic acid]] when it is fermented. Lactic acid acts on the [[protein]] in the milk to make yoghurt thick and sour. The milk is heated to about 80 °C to kill any bacteria present, and to change the milk proteins so that they set together instead of becoming [[curd]]. After it is cooled to about 45 °C, the bacteria culture is added, and the milk is kept at that temperature for 4 to 7 hours to ferment. Yogurt can also be made from [[plant milk]]s such as [[almond milk]], [[soy milk]], and [[coconut milk]]. 
 
 Yogurt is one of the oldest produced foods in human history. No one knows for sure how long yogurt has been around. Today, it is eaten all over the world. It is rich in [[protein]], [[calcium]], [[riboflavin]], [[Vitamin_B6|vitamin B < sub > 6 < /sub > ]] and [[Vitamin B12| vitamin B < sub > 12 < /sub > ]]. 
 
 == Spelling == 
 Yogurt derives romfrom the Turkish word yoğurt and in English, the word can be spelled either 'yogurt' or 'yoghurt'. In Canada 'yogourt' is also common. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://porkandgin.com/other-stuff/words-language/yogurt-yoghurt-yogourt-or/|title=Yogurt, yoghurt, yogourt, or ?|first=John|last=Pope|date=1 April 2015|website=porkandgin|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=February 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  It can be spoken with either a short or a long ''''o''''. 
 
 == History == 
 The earliest yogurts were probably made by wild bacteria (yeast infections) and happened by chance. < ref > Grigoroff, Stamen Étude sur une lait fermenté comestible. Le “Kissélo mléko” de Bulgarie. Revue Médicale de la Suisse Romande. Genéve. Georg & G., Libraires-Éditeurs. Librairie de L’Université. 1905 < /ref > 
 
 The oldest writings mentioning yogurt were by [[Pliny the Elder]], who said that some people knew how to thicken the milk into something which was sour but tasty. < ref > ''The Natural History of Pliny'', tr. John Bostock and H.T. Riley, London: Bell, 1856-93, Volume 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A0EMAAAAIAAJ & q=acrid+kind+of+liquid+with+a+pleasant+flavour & pg=PA84 p. 84]:  " It is a remarkable circumstance, that the barbarous nations which subsist on milk have been for so many ages either ignorant of the merits of cheese, or else have totally disregarded it; and yet they understand how to thicken milk and form there from an acrid kind of milk with a pleasant flavour " . < /ref >   
 
 Stamen Grigorov (1878–1945), a [[Bulgaria]]n student of medicine in [[Geneva]], first examined the bacteria in [[Bulgaria]]n yogurt. In 1905 he said that it contained a round and a rod-like lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907 the rod-like bacteria was called ''Lactobacillus bulgaricus'' (now ''[[Lactobacillus]] delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus''). The [[Russia]]n [[Nobel laureate]] [[biologist]] [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]], from the Pasteur Institute in [[Paris]], was influenced by Grigorov's work and made a [[hypothesis]] that eating yoghurt regularly was the reason why [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] peasants lived for so long. Mechnikov believed that ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' was needed for good health, and worked to make yoghurt popular through Europe. 
 
 == Nutrition == 
 Yoghurt has a lot of [[protein]], [[calcium]], [[riboflavin]], [[vitamin B6]] and [[vitamin B12]] in it. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.ynhh.com/online/nutrition/advisor/yogurt.html |title=Yale-New Haven Hospital nutrition advisor - Understanding yogurt |access-date=2010-05-08 |archive-date=2008-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006073943/http://www.ynhh.com/online/nutrition/advisor/yogurt.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It is healthier than milk is. Many people who are [[lactose intolerance|lactose-intolerant]] can enjoy yoghurt, because much of the lactose in the milk has been changed into lactic acid. < ref > [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/310/1/1 Yogurt--an autodigesting source of lactose.
