 '''Pato''' is a game played on horseback.  It adds ideas from [[polo]] and [[basketball]].

 ''{{lang|es|Pato}}'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for  " [[duck]] " .  The early games used a live duck inside a basket instead of a ball. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.educar.org/Educacionfisicaydeportiva/historia/pato.asp |title=Historia del pato |first=Nidia Mabel |last=Cobiella |work=Educar.org |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of pato |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |quote=Consistía en arrojar un pato hacia arriba y liberar dos grupos de jinetes que se atropellaban para capturarlo como fuera, y llevarlo.

The first team to reach its own ranch house with the duck was the winner. 
 
 Pato was banned several times during its history.  This was due to the violence & mdash;not only to the duck; many [[gaucho]]s were trampled underfoot.  Some lost their lives in knife fights started in the heat of the game. In 1796, a Catholic priest said that pato players who died this way should not get Christian burial. Laws saying people could not play pato were common in the 19th century. 
 
 During the 1930s, pato had rules added by ranch owner Alberto del Castillo Posse.  He made a set of rules based on modern [[polo]]. President [[Juan Perón]] made pato Argentina's national game in 1953. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703509404575300403661697926.html |title=In Soccer-Mad Argentina, the National Sport Is a Lame Duck |first=Matt |last=Moffett |date=June 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |quote=In 1953, President Juan Peron issued a decree making pato the national sport to preserve 'noble customs of pure, historic root.' |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525122119/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703509404575300403661697926.html |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Gameplay== 
 [[File:Levante.jpg|thumb|left|A player picking up the ball]] 
 In modern pato, two four-member teams < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.folkloredelnorte.com.ar/zips/regpato.htm |title=Reglamento oficial del juego de pato |first=Nono |last=Ocaranza Zavalía |work=Folkloredelnorte.com.ar |language=Spanish |trans-title=Official rulebook of the game of pato |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |quote=El número de jugadores será de 4 por bando en todos los juegos y partidos debiendo numerarse del 1 al 4. |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829233319/http://www.folkloredelnorte.com.ar/zips/regpato.htm |url-status=live }} < /ref >  ride on [[horse]]s.  They try to get a ball which has six handles.  They score by throwing the ball through a ring that is [[vertical]]. The rings have a 100 & nbsp;cm (3.3 & nbsp;ft) diameter.  They are on 240 & nbsp;cm (7.9 & nbsp;ft) high poles. A closed net, going up for 140 & nbsp;cm (4.6 & nbsp;ft), holds the ball after goals are scored. 
 
 The winner is the team with most goals scored after the time is done.  Game time is six 8-minute  " periods " . 
 
 The field is: length 180 to 220 m (196.9 to 240.6 yd), width 80 to 90 m (87 to 98 yd). The ball is made of leather, with an inflated rubber chamber and six leather handles. Its diameter is 40 & nbsp;cm (15.7 & nbsp;in) handle-to-handle.  The weight is 1050 to 1250 g (2.3 to 2.8 & nbsp;lbs). 
 
 The player that has control of the ''{{lang|es|pato}}'' (i.e. holds the ball by a handle) must ride with his right arm outstretched.  He offers the pato so rival players have a chance of tugging the pato and stealing it. Not holding his arm out while riding with the pato is an [[wikt:offense|offense]] called ''{{lang|es|negada}}'' (refusal). 
 
 During the tug itself, or ''{{lang|es|cinchada}}'', both players must stand on the [[stirrup]]s and not sit on the [[saddle]]. The hand not tugging must hold the [[wikt:rein|rein]]s. The tug is usually the most exciting part of the game. 
 
 Pato is similar to the game of [[horseball]] played in [[France]], [[Portugal]], and other countries.
