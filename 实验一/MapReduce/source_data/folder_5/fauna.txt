'''Fauna''' means [[animal]] [[life]]. It is a group term; it means the animal life typical of the time or place. It is a similar term to [[flora]] in [[Botany]]. 
 
 So one might speak of the [[Eocene]] fauna as being different from the [[Miocene]] fauna. Or say, the fauna of a particular [[habitat]]. The flora and fauna of a [[savannah]] differ from those of a [[rain forest]]. 
 
 Another use of the word is for published lists of animals, such as: 
 *[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus, Carolus]]. ''Fauna Suecica,'' 1746, the first book to use this term.
