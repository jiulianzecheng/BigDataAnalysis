 '''''Goyescas''''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[opera]] with [[music]] by [[Enrique Granados]] and [[libretto]] by Fernando Periquet y Zuaznabar. It is based on the piano work by Granados which is also called ''Goyescas''. As the melodies had already been created for the piano work, the words of the opera had to be chosen to fit them. 
 
 The opera was first performed in [[New York]], on January 28, 1916.  It is not performed as often as the piano version. 
 
 ==Story== 
 Granados was inspired by the paintings of [[Francisco Goya]].
