'''Reconnaissance''', sometimes called '''scouting''', is the act of exploring to gain [[military]] information. Often referred to as ''recce'' ([[UK]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], {{pronEng|ˈrɛki}}) or ''recon'' ([[U.S.]], {{pronEng|ˈriːkɒn}}), the associated formal [[verb]] is ''reconnoitre'' (British spelling) or ''reconnoiter'' (American spelling). < ref > A Dictionary of Aviation, David W.

The term is sometimes used in civilian / paramilitary and various government contexts. 
 
 == Reconnaissance-in-force == 
 
 Often, units sent out for reconnaissance are armed only for [[self-defense]]. They rely on [[:wikt:stealth|stealth]] to gather [[information]]. Others are well-enough armed to also deny information to the enemy by fighting and or destroying their reconnaissance parties. 
 
 ''Reconnaissance-in-force'' (RIF) is a method of probing an enemy's position. An attack, even with a small force, may get a strong reaction by the enemy. Hopefully that reveals the enemy's strength, deployment, and other [[Military tactics|tactical information]]. The RIF commander can fall back with the information or expand the conflict into a full [[Engagement (military)|engagement]]. Other methods consist of [[hit-and-run tactics]] using moving very fast. In some cases light-armored vehicles are used for added fire superiority, as the need arises.
