 A '''microscope''' is a [[science|scientific]] [[tool|instrument]]. It makes small objects look larger. This lets people see the small things. People who use microscopes frequently  in their jobs include [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[scientist]]s. [[Student]] < nowiki/ > s in science classes such as [[biology]] also use microscopes to study small things. 
 The earliest microscopes had only one [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and are called ''simple microscopes''. ''Compound microscopes'' have at least two lenses. In a compound microscope, the lens closer to the eye is called the ''eyepiece''. The lens at the other end is called the ''objective''. The lenses multiply up, so a 10x eyepiece and a 40x objective together give 400x magnification. 
 
 Microscopes make things seem larger than they are, to about 1000 times larger. This is much stronger than a [[magnifying glass]] which works as a simple microscope. 
 
 == Types of microscopes == 
 There are many types of microscopes. The most common kind of microscope is the compound [[light microscope]]. In a compound light microscope, the object is [[Lighting|illuminated]]: light is thrown on it. The user looks at the image formed by the object. Light passes through two lenses and makes the image bigger. 
 
 The second most common kind are a few kinds of [[electron microscope]]s. [[electron microscope#Transmission electron microscopes (TEM)|Transmission electron microscopes]] (TEMs) fire [[cathode ray]] < nowiki/ > s into the object being looked at. This carries information about how the object looks into a magnetic  " lens " . < ref name= " CAP " > {{cite book|title=Characterization and analysis of polymers|date=2008|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-23300-9}} < /ref >  The image is then magnified onto a [[television screen]]. [[Scanning electron microscope]]s also fire electrons at the object, but in a single beam. These lose their power when they strike the object, and the loss of power results in something else being generatedâ€”usually an [[X-ray]]. This is sensed and magnified onto a screen. [[Scanning tunneling microscope]]s were invented in 1984. 
 
 A [[fluorescence microscope]] is a special kind of [[light microscope]]. In 2014, the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded to [[Eric Betzig]], [[William Moerner]], and [[Stefan Hell]] for  " the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy " .
