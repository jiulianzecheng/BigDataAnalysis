 The '''prostate''' is a [[gland]] of the [[male]] [[body]] that adds part of the fluid to [[semen]] and acts as the valve between semen and urine. A healthy [[human]] prostate is slightly larger than a walnut. It surrounds the [[urethra]] just below the [[urinary bladder]]. 
 
 Prostate [[cancer]] is one of the most common cancers affecting elderly men in developed (also known as [[first world]]) countries and a major cause of [[death]]. Regular rectal exams are recommended for older men to detect prostate cancer early. Prostate cyst is very common in men. With age, the risk of developing this disease increases significantly. A cyst is a kind of cavity formed from the tissue of the prostate itself, inside which fluid accumulates. < ref > [https://drunkentengu.com/kista-predstatelnoy-5691 Prostate cyst: possible causes, symptoms, diagnosis, doctor's consultation and treatment] < /ref >   
 
 The prostate is often referred to as the male [[G-spot]], which is a spot inside the female vagina that causes intense pleasure when it is stimulated. The prostate can be massaged by using a finger or during anal sex. Some males are able to [[orgasm]] with prostate stimulation alone.
