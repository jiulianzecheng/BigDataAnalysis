 If someone is found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of a [[crime]], their [[punishment]] may be to pay a '''fine''', a certain amount of [[money]]. In many countries, fines can be ordered by police, court [[judge]]s and some government [[officer]]s. 
 
 When agreeing to a [[contract]] with a business, a customer may agree to certain rules. If the customer breaks the rules, then they agree to pay a fine for doing so. For example, when somebody [[Car rental|hires a car]] and agrees to return it by Friday, they agree that if they do not return the car by Friday, they must pay a $50 fine to the business.
