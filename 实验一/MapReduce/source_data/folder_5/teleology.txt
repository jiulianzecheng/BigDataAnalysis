'''Teleology''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] idea that things have [[wikt:goal|goals]] or [[cause]]s. It is the  " view that developments are due to the purpose or design which is served by them " . < ref > ''Oxford Shorter Dictionary''. < /ref > 
 
 An example would be [[Aristotle]]'s view of [[nature]], later adopted by the [[Catholic Church]].  The word  " ''teleological'' "  comes from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''telos'', which means  " end "  or  " purpose " . A simpler example would be a tool such as the [[clock]], which is designed by people to tell the time. 
 
 Whether or not an entity (person or god) is needed to cause teleology to happen is one of the most important questions. All cultures we know of have [[creation]] stories in their [[religion]]s. However, much of science operates on the principle that the natural world is [[self-organization|self-organising]]. This applies particularly  to [[astronomy]] and [[biology]], which were once explained as the action of a [[deity]], and are now seen as natural and automatically self-organising. < ref > Quinton, Anthony 1977. Teleology. In Alan Bullock  &  Oliver Stallybrass (eds) ''The Fontana Dictionary of modern thought''. Fontana, London. p626 < /ref >  [[Cybernetics]] is the basic science of self-organising systems. 
 
 The general issue of whether the original sense of teleology applies to the natural world is still a matter of controversy between religion and science.
