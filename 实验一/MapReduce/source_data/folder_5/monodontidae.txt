 '''Monodontidae''' is a small group of [[Odontoceti|toothed whales]] with two [[species]]: the [[narwhal]] ('''''Monodon monoceros''''') and the [[Beluga whale|beluga]] ('''''Delphinapterus leucas'''''). These [[Marine mammal|marine mammals]] are known for their unique characteristics, distribution, and importance in nature. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Myers|first=Phil|title=Monodontidae (beluga and narwhal)|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Monodontidae/|access-date=2023-08-20|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Monodontidae {{!}} mammal family {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/Monodontidae|access-date=2023-08-20|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2023-08-16|title=Beluga {{!}} Habitat, Diet,  &  Facts {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/beluga|access-date=2023-08-20|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|date=2023-08-09|title=Narwhal {{!}} Habitat, Tusk,  &  Facts {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/narwhal|access-date=2023-08-20|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Classification == 
 Monodontidae is in the [[Cetacea]] order, which includes all [[Whale|whales]], [[Dolphin|dolphins]], and [[Porpoise|porpoises]]. It's part of the toothed whale suborder [[Odontoceti]], specifically in the superfamily [[Delphinoidea]]. Monodontidae shares this category with other families like [[Oceanic dolphin|Delphinidae]] (oceanic dolphins) and Phocoenidae (porpoises). < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == Physical Traits == 
 
 === Narwhal === 
 Narwhals have a [[tusk]], a long [[tooth]] growing up to 10 feet (~3 meters) long, mainly seen in males. Female tusks are smaller and cone-shaped. They have spotted gray/brown skin for [[camouflage]] and are medium-sized, about 13 to 18 feet (4 to 5.4 meters) long. < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2010-11-11|title=Narwhal, facts and photos|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/narwhal|access-date=2023-08-20|website=Animals|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 === Beluga === 
 Identified by their white color and round [[forehead]] or melon. They lack [[Dorsal fin|dorsal fins]], helping in icy waters. Belugas reach 13 to 20 feet (4 to 6 meters) long, with males usually being larger.  < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite web|date=2014-03-01|title=Beluga Whale|url=https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/beluga-whale|access-date=2023-08-20|website=Animals|language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite web|title=Beluga Whales ~ MarineBio Conservation Society|url=https://www.marinebio.org/species/beluga-whales/delphinapterus-leucas/|access-date=2023-08-20|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Narwhals and belugas live in the [[Arctic]] and [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]]. Narwhals inhabit the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic]], [[Greenland]], and [[Russia|Russian]] waters. Belugas have a wider range from the Arctic Ocean to subarctic regions like the [[Bering Sea]] and the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]].  < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :2 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / > < ref name= " :4 " > {{Cite web|title=Beluga - Animals Affected by Climate Change|url=https://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/climate-change/animals/beluga|access-date=2023-08-20|website=www.theglobaleducationproject.org|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Behavior == 
 Both species are [[Society|social]] and vocal. Belugas are famous for varied vocalizations like clicks, whistles, and other sounds, important for [[communication]] and [[navigation]] in their often dark habitats. They prefer shallow [[Coast|coastal]] waters and [[Migration|migrate]] based on ice and prey changes. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / > < ref name= " :4 "  / > 
 
 == Diet == 
 Monodontids feed on [[fish]], [[squid]], and [[Crustacean|crustaceans]], adapted to their cold-water homes. They use [[echolocation]] (high-frequency clicks that bounce off objects) to locate prey by echo, detecting prey size, shape, and location. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 == Conservation == 
 [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] lists narwhals and belugas as [[least concern]], but [[climate change]] and habitat loss are potential threats. Shrinking Arctic ice due to warming affects ice-covered hunting/resting areas. Human activities like [[Transport|shipping]] and resource extraction generate [[Pollution|noise pollution]], impacting their communication and navigation. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / > < ref name= " :4 "  / >
