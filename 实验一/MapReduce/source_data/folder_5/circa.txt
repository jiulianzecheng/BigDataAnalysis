 An encyclopedia entry may begin with circa in the date of birth, for example:  " [[Genghis Khan]] (c. 1162 â€“ August 18, 1227) " . The  " c. "  means that he was born in about 1162, but the exact date is not certain. Sometimes the circa symbol is [[italic]]ized to show that it is not in the English language. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Circa Resort  &  Casino Las Vegas: The Time of Your Life|url=https://www.circalasvegas.com/|access-date=2022-10-06|website=Circa Las Vegas|language=en-US}} < /ref >
