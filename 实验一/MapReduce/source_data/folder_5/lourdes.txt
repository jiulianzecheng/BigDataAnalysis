 '''Lourdes''' ({{lang-oc|Lorda}}) is a [[town]] and [[Communes of France|commune]] in the southwest of the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]] [[Departments of France|department]]. It is in the first [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] foothills in the [[Occitanie]] [[Regions of France|region]], in southwestern France. 
 
 Lourdes was originally a small unremarkable [[market town]] lying in the foothills of the Pyrenees. At that time the most prominent feature was the fortified castle which rises up from the centre of the town on a rock. Following the claims that there were apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] to [[Bernadette Soubirous]] in 1858, Lourdes has developed into a major place of [[Christian]] [[pilgrimage]]. 
 
 Today Lourdes has a population of around 15,000 inhabitants but is able to take in some 5,000,000 pilgrims and [[Tourism|tourists]] every season. Lourdes has the second greatest number of hotels in France after Paris with about 270 establishments. 
 
 It is the joint seat of the [[diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Lourdes is overlooked from the south by the Pyrenean peaks of Aneto, Montaigu, and Vignemale (3,298m), while around the town there are three summits reaching up to 1,000 m, which are known as the Béout, the Petit Jer and the Grand Jer. 
 
 It has an area of {{Convert|36.94|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on }} and its average [[altitude]] is {{Convert|550|m|ft|abbr=on}}; at the [[City and town halls|city hall]], the altitude is {{Convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on }}. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.map-france.com/Lourdes-65100/ |title=City of Lourdes |publisher=Map-France.com |language= |accessdate=18 February 2017 |date= }} < /ref >
