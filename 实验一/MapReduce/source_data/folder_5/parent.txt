 '''Parents''' are the [[mother]] and [[father]] or caretaker of their offspring. < !-- Please remember 'parent' isn't a word only about humans. Thank you! -- >   
 
 In humans, a parent is the [[mother]] or the [[father]] figure of a child. They are either biologically or legally related to the person. When parents separate and choose who takes care of a child it is called ''[[child custody|custody]]''. Parents who fail in their duty may be guilty of [[child abuse]].
