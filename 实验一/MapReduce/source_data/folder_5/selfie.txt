 A '''selfie''' is a [[self-portrait]] photograph. It is typically taken with a hand-held [[digital camera]] or [[camera phone]]. 
 
 One of the first self-portraits was taken in 1839 by Robert Cornelius, an [[United States|American]] [[photographer]]. < ref > Sean Ross Meehan, ''Mediating American Autobiography: Photography in Emerson, Thoreau, Douglass, and Whitman'' (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2008), p. 23 < /ref >  The term  " selfie "  was first used by photographer Jim Krause in 2005. < ref > Jim Krause, ''Photo Idea Index'', 2005.

 A black crested [[macaque]] (''Macaca nigra'') stole a camera, and took a photo of herself. The selfie seemed to set a legal [[precedent]] when the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] rejected a [[copyright]] claim. The ground was that a non-human could not own a copyright, and the camera owner had not taken the photo, and so also could not own the copyright. And so, the photo was not under copyright. < ref > Leonard, Andrew 6 August 2014. Wikipedia at war! “Monkey selfie” sets off bizarre copyright dispute. ''Salon''.
