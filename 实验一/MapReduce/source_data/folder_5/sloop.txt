 A '''sloop''' is a [[sailboat]] usually with one [[mast]] and [[fore-and-aft rig]]ged [[sail]]s. < ref name=Stevenson1359 > ''Concise Oxford English Dictionary'', eds. Angus Stevenson; Maurice Waite (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 1359 < /ref >  It can also describe a [[square rig]]ged sailing ship of two or more masts which is sometimes called a '''sloop of war'''. < ref name=Stevenson1359/ >  The [[French people|French]] called them [[corvette]]s. < ref name=Anderson109 > Romola Anderson; R. C. Anderson, ''A Short History of the Sailing Ship'' (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2012), p. 109 < /ref >  Originally the definition of a sloop was [[wikt:vague|vague]]. A 1750 book said sloops  " are sailed and masted as men's fancies lead them, sometimes with one mast, with two, and with three. " < ref name=Anderson109/ >  Modern [[recreation]]al sloops are almost always one-masted sailing ships with fore-and-aft sails. < ref name=ReynoldsASA > {{cite web |url=https://asa.com/news/2015/05/20/whats-in-a-rig-sloop/# |title=Whatâ€™s in a Rig? The Sloop |author=Pat Reynolds |date=May 20, 2015 |publisher=American Sailing Association |access-date=December 25, 2016}} < /ref >  Their simple layout makes them popular with [[amateur]] sailors. < ref name=ReynoldsASA/ >  The sloop is a [[wikt:manage|manage]]able sailboat layout up to a length of about {{convert|45|ft}}. < ref name=ReynoldsASA/ > 
 
 == History == 
 The sloop design dates back to the early part of the [[17th century]]. < ref name=ReynoldsASA/ >  By the [[20th century]] they became very popular. Their main advantages are their ease of handling and ability to sail [[wikt:upwind|upwind]] (into the wind). < ref name=ReynoldsASA/ >   
 
 An early 17th century design was the Bermuda sloop, so-named for the Bermuda trade with [[North America]]. < ref name=bermudasloopSF > {{cite web |url=http://thescuttlefish.com/2011/08/strange-love-craft-the-bermuda-sloop/ |title=Strange Love Craft: The Bermuda Sloop |date=August 15, 2011 |publisher=The Scuttlefish |access-date=December 25, 2016}} < /ref >  It was designed to be fast and could sail in both directions. < ref name=bermudasloopSF/ >  They needed to be fast to outrun French [[privateer]]s. The [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was made from Bermuda [[cedar]]. < ref name=bermudasloopSF/ >  The [[wood]] was light and resisted [[wikt:rot|rot]]. < ref name=bermudasloopSF/ >  They had from one to three masts. < ref name=bermudasloopSF/ >

 Most modern sailboats are based on the Bermuda sloop design. < ref name=bermudasloopSF/ >  The Bermuda rig replaced the earlier [[gaff rig]] which used a four-cornered sail (instead of a triangular sail) and a [[spar (sailing)|spar]]. < ref name=Rousmaniere42 > John Rousmaniere; Mark Smith, ''The Annapolis Book of Seamanship'', Third Edition (New York: Simon  &  Schuster, 1999), p. 42 < /ref >  A gaff rig design allows more sail on a mast. Another advantage is the gaff rig and other early designs can spill wind faster in a blow (heavy wind). < ref name=Rousmaniere42/ >   
 
 The sloop of war was the most numerous design in the [[Royal Navy]] by the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. < ref name=Mclaughlan6 > Ian Mclaughlan, ''The Sloop of War: 1650-1763'' (Barnsley, South Yorkshire: Pen  &  Sword Books Ltd., 2014), p. 6 < /ref >  Yet very little has been written about them or their French counterpart, the Corvettes. < ref name=Mclaughlan6/ >  Later, the [[United States]] used sloops of war. < ref name=Mclaughlan6/ >  The Royal Navy used the class of  " sloop "  right up until the end of [[World War II]]. < ref name=Mclaughlan6/ >  The sailing sloop, like its larger cousin the [[frigate]], were fast and used in a variety of roles. < ref name=Mclaughlan6/ >  They were not usually used in battle, but were more often used for support in [[reconnaissance]] and for carrying messages. < ref name=Mclaughlan6/ >  They were probably the best of the Royal Navy sailing ships for maneuverability and could function in all but the roughest sea conditions. < ref name=Mclaughlan6/ >
