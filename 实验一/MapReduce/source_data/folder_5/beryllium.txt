{{Infobox beryllium}} 
 '''Beryllium''' is in [[Group (periodic table)|group 2]] of the periodic table, so it is an [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] [[metal]]. It is grayish (slightly gray) in color. It has an [[atomic number]] of 4 and is [[symbol]]ized by the letters '''Be'''. It is [[toxic]] and should not be handled without proper training. 
 
 Beryllium has 4 [[electrons]], 4 [[protons]], and 5 [[neutrons]]. 
 
 Beryllium has one of the highest [[melting point]]s of the light metals: 1560 K (1287 & nbsp;Â°C). It is added to other metals to make stronger [[alloy]]s. Beryllium-copper alloy is used in tools because it does not make [[spark]]s. 
 
 At [[standard temperature and pressure]], beryllium resists [[oxidation]] when exposed to oxygen. 
 
 Beryllium is best known for the [[chemical compound]]s it forms.  Beryllium combines with [[aluminium]], [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]] to make a [[mineral]] called [[beryl]].  [[Emerald]] and [[aquamarine]] are two varieties of beryl which are used as gemstones in [[jewelry]]. 
 
 Since it has a very high stiffness to weight ratio, beryllium is used to make the diaphragms in some high-end [[Loudspeaker|speakers]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Beryllium is used to make [[jet aircraft]]s, [[guided missile]]s, [[spacecraft]], and [[Satellite (artificial)|satellites]], including the [[James Webb telescope]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40452949|title=Metals handbook|date=1998|publisher=ASM International|others=Davis, J.

 == Rarity == 
 It is a relatively rare element in the [[universe]]. It usually occurs when larger atomic nuclei have split up. In stars, beryllium is depleted because it is fused and builds larger elements.
