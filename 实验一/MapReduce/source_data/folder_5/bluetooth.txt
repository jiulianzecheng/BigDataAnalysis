 '''Bluetooth''' is a [[protocol]] for [[Wireless LAN|wireless communication]] over short distances. It was developed in the 1990s, to reduce the number of cables.  Devices such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[computer printer|printers]], [[digital camera]]s and [[video game console]]s can connect to each other, and exchange information. This is done using [[radio wave]]s. It can be done securely. Bluetooth is usually only used for relatively short distances, like a few metres. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/what-is-the-range-of-bluetooth-and-how-can-it-be-extended.html|title=What Is The Range Of Bluetooth And How Can It Be Extended?|last=Peshin|first=Akash|date=2018-01-09|website=Science ABC|language=en-us|access-date=2020-07-21}} < /ref >  Some signals can be up to 100 metres. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 There are different standards. Data rates vary. Currently, they are at 1-3 MBit per second. Typical Bluetooth applications are to connect a [[headset]] to a mobile phone, or to connect a [[computer mouse]], [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]] or [[computer printer|printer]]. 
 
 Bluetooth devices use the [[ISM Band]] around 2.4 GHz. This can be used worldwide, without the need to pay license fees, but many other devices, like [[DECT]] telephones (wireless phones), smart tags with [[RFID]], [[baby phone]]s use it too. Bluetooth uses the same bands as some [[WLAN]]s, but the modulation technique is different. Bluetooth uses [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgYyBwAAQBAJ & dq=Bluetooth+uses+Frequency-hopping+spread+spectrum & pg=PA222|title=Modeling Mobility with Open Data: 2nd SUMO Conference 2014 Berlin, Germany, May 15-16, 2014|last1=Behrisch|first1=Michael|last2=Weber|first2=Melanie|date=2015-03-11|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-15024-6|location=|pages=223|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Comparing Bluetooth to Wireless LAN == 
 
 There are many situations today where either Bluetooth or [[Wireless LAN]]s can be used. Examples include setting up networks, printing or transferring files and data from a [[PDA]] to a computer. Both are versions of unlicensed wireless technology. [[WLAN]]s can span bigger distances and offer higher throughput. Bluetooth does not require expensive hardware. It also needs less power to operate. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VW-BAAAQBAJ & dq=Bluetooth+uses+less+power+than+WLAN & pg=PA20|title=Recent Advances in Information Technology: RAIT-2014 Proceedings|last1=Biswas|first1=G.

 Both use the same [[radio frequency]] range, but their [[modulation]] techniques are different. Both have been developed to replace [[cable|cabling]]. Bluetooth wanted to get rid of the [[peripheral equipment]] cables, WLANs wanted to get rid of the cables needed to set up a [[Local Area Network|LAN]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4B1wmHjLl9wC & dq=Bluetooth+wanted+to+get+rid+of+the+peripheral+equipment+cables & pg=PA464|title=Selected Readings on Electronic Commerce Technologies: Contemporary Applications: Contemporary Applications|last=Wen-Chen|first=Hu|date=2008-08-31|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60566-097-4|location=|pages=464|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3Q1JfbKRNQC & dq=Wireless+LAN+to+use+fewer+cables & pg=PT349|title=LAN Switching and Wireless, CCNA Exploration Companion Guide: CCNA Exploration Companion Guide|last=Lewis|first=Wayne|date=2008-04-28|publisher=Cisco Press|isbn=978-0-13-287747-3|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 === Bluetooth devices === 
 [[File:Drone 4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Bluetooth [[USB]] dongle with a 100m range.]] 
 Bluetooth exists in many products, such as telephones, the [[Wii]] or [[PlayStation 3]]. It has recently been built into some electronic watches, modems and headsets. The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations. Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones (i.e. with a Bluetooth headset) or byte data with hand-held computers (transferring files). 
 
 Bluetooth uses [[protocol]]s that make it easy to discover devices that are nearby, and to set up a connection between these devices. Bluetooth devices can advertise all the services they offer. Using services becomes easier; a lot of the setup related to [[security]], networking or permissions is automatic. 
 
 === Wireless LAN === 
 [[WLAN]]s are more like traditional [[LAN]]s. More configuration is needed to set up the network, and to make resources accessible by other devices in the network. WLAN devices also consume more power than Bluetooth ones.  
 Sometimes WLANs are called wireless [[Ethernet]]. WLAN needs more resources to be set up, but it also offers faster transfer speeds. The security is also better than that offered by Bluetooth.
