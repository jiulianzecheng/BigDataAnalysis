 The '''scalp''' is the [[Anatomy|anatomical]] area between the [[face]] and the [[neck]].  
 
 == Layers == 
 It is usually described as having five layers, which can be remembered with the [[mnemonic]]  " SCALP " : < ref > [[Mnemonic|Mnemonic at medicalmnemonics.com]] ''[http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/cgi-bin/lookup.cfm?id1=258 & id2= & id3= & id4= 258] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202173615/http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/cgi-bin/lookup.cfm?id1=258 & id2= & id3= & id4= |date=2008-12-02 }}'' < /ref > 
 
 * S: The [[skin]] on the head from which [[head hair]] grows. It is richly supplied with [[blood]] vessels. 
 * C: Connective [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]]. a thin layer of [[fat]] and fibrous tissue lies beneath the skin 
 * A: The aponeurosis (or [[Epicranial aponeurosis]]) is the next layer. It is a tough layer of dense [[fiber|fibrous]] tissue 
 * L: The ''loose areolar connective tissue'' layer provides an easy plane of separation between the upper three layers and the ''pericranium''.  In [[scalping]] the scalp is torn off through this layer.   
 * P: The [[pericranium]] is the [[periosteum]] of the [[skull bone]]s and provides [[nutrition]] to the bone and the capacity for repair.  It may be lifted from the bone to allow removal of bone windows ([[craniotomy]]).
