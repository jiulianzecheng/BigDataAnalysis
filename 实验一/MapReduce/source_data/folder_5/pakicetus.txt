 '''Pakicetus''' is a genus of extinct [[cetacean]]s found in the early [[Eocene]] of [[Pakistan]] 55.8 ± 0.2 - 33.9 ± 0.1 million years ago (mya). The [[strata]] where the fossils were found was then on the coast of the [[Tethys Sea]]. < ref > Gingerich, Philip D.  &  Russell, Donald E. 1981.

 == Description == 
 The first fossil, a lone skull, was thought to be a [[mesonychid]], but Gingerich and Russell recognized it as an early cetacean. It had characteristics of the [[inner ear]] which are found only in cetaceans: the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only. This suggests that it is a [[transitional species]] between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans. < ref > Gingerich, Philip D. ''et al'' 1983.

 Complete skeletons were discovered in 2001. ''Pakicetus'' was mainly a land animal, about the size of a wolf, and very similar in form to the related [[mesonychid]]s.
