'''Ageism''' is when a person is treated badly only because of their [[Ageing|age]]. Ageism can be [[discrimination]] by one person or by a part of [[society]] as a group. Discrimination is when a person is left out or [[abuse]]d by somebody who does not like something about them. For example,  their [[face|facial features]], their [[height]] or their [[skin]]. 
 
 There have been many issues at the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[broadcasting]] [[company]], [[BBC]], dealing with people saying that they have issues with ageism. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12161045|title=BBC News: Miriam O'Reilly wins Countryfile ageism claim}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1346649/BBC-ageism-row-Older-stars-work-just-days-month.html|title=Older stars work just two days a month}} < /ref >  Ageism is often common in the [[entertainment]] [[industry]] where what a person looks like is felt by many to be important. 
 
 There are two targets for age discrimination: old people (also called senior citizens) and young people. Discrimination against old and young people can happen at places like job interviews. For example, a company might hire a worker who is about 30 years old instead of someone who is about 50 years old, or someone who is around 20 years old, regardless of skill level. Another common example of ageism is not allowing  " minors " , or young people, to [[vote]], [[drink]], drive, [[work]], [[marry]], [[gamble]], or give sexual consent.
