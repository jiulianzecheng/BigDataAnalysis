 {{nihongo|'''Lolicon'''|ロリコン|}}, is a [[slang]] word for the phrase  " Lolita complex " . < ref name= " Mead " > {{cite magazine|last=Mead|first=Rebecca |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25145481_ITM|title=Shopping rebellion; what the kids want.

It denotes a [[genre]] of [[manga]] and [[anime]] in which young female [[Fictional character|characters]] are shown in a sexual way. The word is a reference to [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s book, ''[[Lolita]]''. In the book, a middle-aged man sexually desires a 12-year-old girl. < ref name= " Kinsella305 " > Kinsella, 305. < /ref > 
 
 Some people claim that lolicon adds to actual sexual abuse of children, while others claim that there is no facts that show this, or that facts show the opposite. Countries have tried to make lolicon that shows children naked or having [[sex]] illegal as a type of [[child pornography]].  
 
 One of the few that has made it actually illegal is the [[United Kingdom]] where the possession of lolicon pornography is illegal. These laws have been criticised heavily, < ref > [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/graphic-artists-condemn-plans-to-ban-erotic-comics-1652270.html Graphic Artists Condemn Plans to Ban Erotic Comics]. ''The Independant'' < /ref >  and charges of lolicon child porn tend not to stick, because a [[judge]] reasons that no real children were harmed to make it and posses it and therefore it is not worth [[conviction]], or because the harm that will be caused by giving the person a jail sentence is considered disproportionate to their charges. < ref > [https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/news/leeds-news/paedophile-armley-elder-scrolls-skyrim-15232406 Paedophile avoids jail after making animated child porn] .
