 A '''gram''', or '''gramme''', is a [[unit]] of measure in the [[metric system]]. It measures [[mass]], or how much [[matter]] something is. The symbol is '''g'''. One gram used to be defined as the mass of one [[cubic centimetre]] of pure [[water]] at 3.98 degrees [[Celsius]]. Now one gram is defined as 1/1000 of a [[kilogram]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Metric system - Facts from the Encyclopedia|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/metricsy|publisher=Yahoo!
