 '''Security''' means to prevent dangers or losses. In general, security is similar to [[safety]]. The difference between the two is that security cares more than general safety about dangers from the outside. 
 
 Airports and banks usually have a lot of security measures. [[Prison]] security is used mainly to stop [[prisoner]]s from escaping. It is also used to stop prisoners from harming prison [[employee]]s or other [[prisoner]]s. 
 
 Maximum security is found in or around prisons or other types of places where people need to be kept in or kept out. It is the highest security level for a building or area.
