 '''Beerus''' is a fictional god from ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''. He resembles a purple cat and is accompanied by his teacher [[Whis]]. Beerus is known as the God of Destruction. He earned the name after lots of training.  
 
 He is very powerful but can also be lazy with a love for food. Beerus's design is based off of Dragon Ball creator [[Akira Toriyama]]'s pet [[sphynx cat]] Debo. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/anime/news/dragon-ball-super-beerus-inspiration-cat-akira-toriyama-anime/|accessdate=August 9, 2023|title=Dragon Ball Super: Akira Toriyama Reveals His Model For Beerus|publisher=ComicBook.com}} < /ref >
