 The '''Hymenoptera''' is one of the larger orders of [[insect]]. It includes the [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[sawflies]] and [[ant]]s. There are over 130,000 recognised species, with many more remaining to be described. < ref > [http://www.earthlife.net/insects/hymenop.htmlenoptera Earthlife.net]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] words ''hymen'' meaning 'membrane' and ''ptera'' meaning 'wings. The hindwings are connected to the forewings by a series of hooks called ''hamuli''. 
 
 Females typically have a special [[ovipositor]] for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places.  The ovipositor is often modified into a [[sting]]er. The young develop through complete [[metamorphosis]] â€” that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature (See [[holometabolism]]). 
 
 == Sub-order Symphyta == 
 These are the sawflies, the most primitive Hymenoptera. Their adults do not have a narrow 'waist' between the [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]]. The female's ovipositor is adapted to [[burrow]]ing or [[saw]]ing into the [[substrate]], usually plant tissue.  
 
 == Sub-order Apocrita == 
 These, the bees, wasps and ants, have a 'waist' between the thorax and abdomen. They are by far the most numerous Hymenoptera, and include the famous groups of [[colony (biology)|colonial]] insects. In fact, the group with the most species is not colonial; it is the vast number of [[parasitoid]] wasps, such as the [[Ichneumon]]s. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 Hymenoptera originated in the [[Triassic]]: the oldest [[fossil]]s belong to the Sawfly family [[Sawfly#Xyelidae|Xyelidae]]. Social hymenopterans appeared during the [[Cretaceous]]. < ref name=IIBD1 > {{cite book |author= Hoell H.V.
