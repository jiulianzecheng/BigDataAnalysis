 '''''Guarinisuchus''''' is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of crocodyliform from the Late [[Cretaceous]] and [[Early Paleocene]] periods, 66-62 million years ago of the [[Mar√≠a Farinha Formation]], [[Brazil]]. < ref name=FWGuarinisuchus > [http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo & taxon_no=194871 ''Guarinisuchus''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811223326/http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo & taxon_no=194871 |date=2017-08-11 }} at [[Fossilworks]].org < /ref >  It was a dominant predator in its environment, and reached a length of 3 & nbsp;m (10 & nbsp;ft). ''Guarinisuchus'' appears to be closely related to marine crocodylomorphs found in [[Africa]], which supports the hypothesis that the group originated in Africa and migrated to [[South America]] before spreading into the waters off the North American coast. < ref > [http://brazilinhotpants.wordpress.com/2008/03/31/guarinisuchus-munizi-the-new-brazilian-crocodile/ The new Brazilian crocodile] < /ref >
