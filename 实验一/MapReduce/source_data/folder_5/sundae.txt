 A '''sundae''' is an [[ice cream]] [[dessert]]. It is usually made of a scoop of ice cream topped with sauce or syrup. Sometimes, it has other toppings including chopped nuts, [[sprinkles]], [[whipped cream]], or [[maraschino cherry|maraschino cherries]]. The first historically documented sundae was created on Sunday, April 3, 1892. Sundaes are found and available to buy in many places, including fast foods, restaurants, and other luxury places. Sundaes are usually sweeter than ice cream and the scoops of ice cream and flavors can be customized.
