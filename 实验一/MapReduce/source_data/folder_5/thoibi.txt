 == Early life == 
 === Meeting Khamnu === 
 [[File:THOIBI, SENU AND KHAMNU.jpg|thumb|300px|Princess Thoibi meeting [[Khamnu]] in a marketplace.]]  
 One day, Princess Thoibi visited the marketplace of [[Ancient Moirang|Moirang]]. She saw the girl [[Khamnu]] selling wood. She asked Khamnu many questions. She even gave her food and jewelry. Thoibi and Khamnu became good friends. The next time Thoibi went to the market, she met Khamnu again. Thoibi asked Khamnu to come with her fishing on [[Loktak lake]]. The king heard that the princess and her friends were going fishing for fun on the lake. He ordered all the men in the kingdom to stay away from the lake. Khamnu told her brother Khamba about this the royal order. The next day, she left him at home. Khamba was sleeping and had a dream. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/n181/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T. C.

 === Meeting Khamba === 
 [[File:Khuman Khamba in the Loktak lake.jpg|thumb|300px|Thoibi saw Khamba sailing on a boat in the [[Loktak lake]].]] 
 In Khamba's dream, Goddess [[Ayangleima (disambiguation)|Ayangleima]] (either [[Panthoibi]] or [[Koiren Leima]]) made herself look like [[Khamnu]] and asked him to get vegetables. Khamba woke up and wondered about his dream. God [[Thangjing]] made him think that he had truly seen his sister [[Khamnu]]. So he rowed down the lake in a rowboat. But he went in the wrong direction. The God Thangjing spread clouds over the hills, and there was a storm. It blew the boat towards Thoibi and her friends on their fishing trip. Thoibi saw Khamba standing close to her. She asked Khamnu if she knew the strange man disobeying the royal order. Khamnu said no. Khamba did not know what to do. Hearing his sister's voice, he went closer. Thoibi saw that Khamba was handsome, manly, muscular, and well fashioned. Khamba was also amazed at Thoibi's  beauty and glamour. It was God's will that they should be lovers. Khamnu worried that her brother might get punished for disobedience. Thoibi noticed a piece of Khamnu's cloth matching Khamba’s headdress. She also discovered Khamba wearing the bracelet she had given to Khamnu. Later, Khamnu revealed the truth. Then, Thoibi became kind to Khamba. She gave him good food. She told him to go home before the King heard that he had broken his rule and come to the lake. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/136/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T.

 == Oath to her lover == 
 Princess Thoibi visited [[Khamnu]]'s house. Thoibi sat on the red cloth near the post of the north side (ukoklel). The walls of the old house were full of holes. So Khamba hid himself within a mat. Thoibi asked Khamnu about the mat. Khamnu said that it was the worshipping place of God [[Khuman Pokpa]]. So Thoibi asked if she could pray to the God. She wanted to be blessed by the God. Thoibi knew the truth very well. But she pretended if she knew nothing. She prayed out loud to the God to allow her to worship him daily in the house. Khamba heard her voice. He laughed aloud. Thoibi said the God was speaking. She came out in the veranda. Meanwhile, Khamba sent his sister to the market to get some fruit. At Khamnu's absence, Thoibi presented him gifts. The two bound themselves by an oath before the God [[Khuman Pokpa]]. They drank the water in which a golden bracelet had been dipped. They vowed to be lovers forever. After this oath, Thoibi addresed Khamnu as  " sister " . < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/137/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T.

 On the day of customary rituals to be performed, Khamba first offered his flowers to God Thangjing. After that, Khamba gave the flowers to the king, to the queen and then to the high officers of [[Ancient Moirang|Moirang]].  
 Everyone was happy with the flowers. They gave Khamba gifts. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/140/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T. C.

 == Exile == 
 [[File:PRINCESS THOIBI BEING BEATEN BY HER FATHER CHINGKHUBA.jpg|thumb|300px|Thoibi being beaten by her father for not obeying him]] 
 Thoibi's father asked her to marry [[Nongban|Nongban Kongyamba]]. But she said no. Her father was angry and he said,  " I will be better to be childless than be the father of this evil girl. "  He asked his Minister Hanjaba to sell Thoibi to the Kabaw chief for silver and gold. He exiled her to Kabaw chiefdom. He did not want to see her any more. Thoibi told Khamba about what happened. For his sake, she had to go exile to Kabaw. She told Khamba not to forget her.  
 On the day of her exile, she cried so hard that she sounded like thunder. The queen and all her maids also wept. Minister Hanjaba took her away to Kabaw. On the way, she met Khamba. He wept with her remembering the past happy days. Both the lovers felt the pain of separation. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/148/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T. C.

 Khamba gave Thoibi a staff to lean on as she walked. On her way, Thoibi planted the staff by the roadside. She wished for it to grow flowers and become a living, leafy tree if she remained faithful to Khamba. She also marked a roadside stone. Finally, she reached Kabaw. But Chief Tamurakpa of Kabaw felt sorry for Thoibi. He kept her as a guest. Thoibi became a friend of Changning Kanbi, the daughter of the chief. But the evil women of Kabaw persuaded Changning to treat Thoibi like a servant. Thoibi was sent to catch fish and to gather firewood. Thoibi was busy with her work. However, she always dreamed that Khamba was with her. Thangjing took pity on her. Chief Tamurakpa heard about the harsh treatments of Thoibi by his own daughter. So he asked all the women to weave one cloth each. Changning called Thoibi a wayward child. It was because of Thoibi had not wanted to marry Kongyamba. Changning knew Kongyamba was muscular, attractive and the son of famous ancestors. So she thought Kongyamba as a good man.  
 Tamurakpa heard his daughter's words. He was angry with her. He was about to strike her but Thoibi stopped him. The two ladies wove their cloths. Changning was jealous of Thoibi. In the night, Changning tore holes in Thoibi's cloth with a [[porcupine]] quill. Later, Thoibi found all that had been done. However, she repaired all the holes and made the cloth even more beautiful than before. Tamurakpa liked Thoibi's cloth very much. He threw his own daughter's cloth away. 
 One day, when Thoibi was working at her [[loom|cloth making machine]], a wind brought ashes towards her. She knew it was from Moirang. She wept remembering her beloved Khamba and her hometown. The God Thangjing softened her father's heart. He sent men to bring her back. However, he asked Kongyamba to marry Thoibi on her way home. However, Thoibi prayed to the patron deity of the Kabaw chiefdom. She thanked Chief Tamurakpa for his kindness.  
 On her way, she saw the stone on which she had written her promise to be faithful to Khamba. She prayed to it and offered gold and silver on it. She saw Khamba's staff which she had planted. It had grown flowers and become a living, leafy tree. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/149/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T. C.

 == Escape from Kongyamba == 
 [[File:KHAMBA THOIBI EPIC - THOIBI TRICKS KONGYAMBA.jpg|thumb|300px|Thoibi escaped from [[Nongban|Angom Nongban Kongyamba]] by tricking him]] 
 When Thoibi was on her way back home, her suitor Angom Nongban Kongyamba waited for her. Kongyamba asked his watchmen if Princess Thoibi was coming. After looking carefully, they shouted, 
 " Lo, the Princess is at band. " 
 Thoibi heard the shout. She instructed her companions to sit near her if the man was Khamba but far away if the man was Kongyamba. 
 It was Kongyamba and not Khamba.  
 However, she went on. She pretended to be friendly to him. She sat on the red carpet Kongyamba had brought. However, she placed a stick between Kongyamba and herself. She asked him for fruit to eat. Kongyamba brought her fruit. But she did not eat the fruit. She pretended to get ill due to her long journey from Kabaw. Kongyamba was worried.  
 She asked Kongyamba to let her ride on his horse. He agreed. So Thoibi rode Kongyamba's horse and Kongyamba rode in Thoibi's palanquin.   
 Suddenly, Thoibi galloped off on the horse towards Khamba's house. Khamba met her there. They wept because they were together again. 
 Kongyamba was angry that he had been tricked a girl. He asked the king's ministers to act. Minister Thonglen and Minister Nongtholba sent men to protect Khamba and Thoibi from their enemies. 
 The matter was set before the King in the royal court. The king wanted to solve the issue by the trial of the spear. During the talk, an old man came to the meet the king. The old man told him that a ferocious tiger was a great threat to the villagers in a place called Khoirentak.  
 The king changed his mind. He said he would use the tiger to decide what to do. He said that person who killed the tiger could marry Princess Thoibi. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/150/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T. C.

 == Marriage and death == 
 Khamba killed the man-eating tiger.  
 Thus, Khamba and Thoibi married each other in high state by the King of [[Moirang]]. 
 One day, Khamba wondered if Thoibi was faithful to him. He wanted to test her chastity. One night, he pretended to travel away from home. Then, he secretly returned home. In disguise as a stranger, he pushed a stick through the wall of Thoibi's room. He was teasing Thoibi. Thoibi was not aware of all this. So, she thought it had been done by a stranger. She got angry.  
 She pushed a spear through the wall to hit the stranger. Khamba was severely wounded. He called her. Thoibi knew his voice. She immediately went out and carried him inside. Khamba was dying. She was extremely shocked. Before he died, she killed herself upon him with the same spear. 
 Khamba and Thoibi are the incarnations of a god and a goddess. They were sent by Thangjing. Unlike normal mortal beings, God Thangjing denied their happiness of long life and children. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/151/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T.
