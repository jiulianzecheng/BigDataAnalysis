 [[File:JeffDaehn.jpg|left|thumb|The keyboard of a carillon]] 
 A '''carillon''' is a [[musical instrument]] consisting of [[bell]]s. Carillons are usually in [[bell tower]]s, and are made up of at least 23 bells. (If there are less than 23 bells, the instrument is called a '''chime'''.) A church in [[Michigan]], called Kirk in the Hills, has 77 bells, the most of any carillon. 
 
 The bells in a carillon are usually made to ring using a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. It is similar to the one in a [[piano]] or [[Organ (music)|organ]], but is made up of [[wood]]en [[baton]]s that are hit with closed [[wikt:fist|fists]] instead of pressing them with [[finger]]s (see the picture on the left). Each baton is linked to a bell with a different [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and makes it ring out. The bell with the lowest pitch is called the  " bourdon " , and many carillons have [[Pedal (music)|pedal keyboards]] for the largest bells. The instrument is very heavy, and the world's heaviest carillon, which is in a [[New York City]] church, weights 91 [[tonne]]s. 
 
 Not all carillons use a keyboard. Some of them are automated, meaning they play music without a human. They can be controlled using a [[clock]]work mechanism, similar to the one in [[Big Ben]], so that the music plays at certain times every day. Two examples of this kind of carillon are the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Moscow]] [[Kremlin]] and the [[Munttoren]] in [[Amsterdam]]. More recent carillons, such as the one in the [[Peace Tower]] in [[Ottawa]], are [[computer]]-controlled.
