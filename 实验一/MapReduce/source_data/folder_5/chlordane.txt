 '''Chlordane''' is an [[insecticide]], introduced in 1947. It is an [[organochloride]] that acts like a contact [[poison]]. It can be produced using the [[Diels–Alder reaction]], and has at least 147 constituents. Its main use was in treating [[seed]]s, e.g. of [[potato]]es, [[wheat]], or [[vegetable]]s. It was also used for [[wood preservation]], and against [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. Chlordane only degrades slowly, which means that it is relatively easy to spread it over long distances. It accumulates in the body of animals, in [[mammal]]s mostly in the [[nervous system]] and the [[liver]]. Chlordane has been shown to cause [[cancer]] in [[mouse|mice]]; it may cause cancer in humans. Chlordane is [[toxin|toxic]]. It is listed in the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]].
