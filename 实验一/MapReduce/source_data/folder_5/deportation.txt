'''Deportation''', means the removal of someone from a [[country]]. People may be deported from a country for many reasons. For example, one may be deported from a country if he has got into the country illegally, or without a [[visa]] (permission). 
 
 Deportation can also happen inside a country. A person or a group of people may be forced to move to a different part of the country, as a [[wikt:punishment|punishment]].
