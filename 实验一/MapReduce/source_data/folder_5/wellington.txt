 '''Wellington''' is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[New Zealand]]. It has been the capital since 1865. Before then [[Auckland]] was the capital. Wellington is the second largest city in New Zealand. In 2018, 202,737 people lived in the city < ref name= " nzcensus " > {{cite web|url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/tools/2018-census-place-summaries/wellington-city|title=Place Summaries {{!}} Wellington City {{!}} Stats NZ|work=2018 New Zealand Census|publisher=Stats NZ}} < /ref >  and about twice that in its [[metropolitan area]]. 
 
 Wellington is in the middle of New Zealand, at the south end of the [[North Island]]. South of Wellington is Cook Strait, the sea between the North Island and the [[South Island]]. The city has a lot of hills and a deep harbour. The middle of the city is busier than most small cities and is easy for people to walk around.  
 
 It was named for [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. Wellington became famous when [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' movie trilogy]] was made there. In [[Māori language|Māori]], the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] language, its name is ''Te Whanganui-a-Tara.'' < ref > {{Cite web|title=Whanganui-a-Tara, Te - Te Aka Māori Dictionary|url=https://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/|access-date=2022-04-28|website=Whanganui-a-Tara, Te - Te Aka Māori Dictionary|language=en}} < /ref >
