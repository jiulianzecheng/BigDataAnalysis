 A '''teacup''' is a [[porcelain]] [[cup]] that is used to hold [[liquid]] for [[drink]]ing. It is usually used for drinking [[tea]]. It is also used for drinking [[coffee]] or some other hot drink. A teacup has a [[Handle (grip)|handle]] on the side that stays cool when the rest of the cup is too hot to hold. It also has its own small [[plate]] to sit on, called a ''[[saucer]]''. 
 
 These can be made from ceramic, clay, [[glass]] or even [[plastic]]. Usually, teacups are ceramic (made of porcelain) because it is safer. Teacups can also be made for decoration. If they are made for decoration, their owners might keep them on display and not actually use them.  
 
 Teacups are often [[Decoration|decorated]] with patterns or pictures. Those painted by hand can be expensive. Some people collect decorated teacups as a [[hobby]].
