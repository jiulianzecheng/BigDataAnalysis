 '''Moles''' are small [[mammals]] [[adapted]] to a [[burrowing]] (under the ground) [[lifestyle]]. This lifestyle is called ''fossorial''. 
 
 Moles are found in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. They eat [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e or [[worm]]s. Moles have velvety, soft fur. They have powerful front paws so they can dig. A mole has an extra [[thumb]]. 
 
 The family includes the [[shrew mole]]s and the [[desman]]s. There are  
 three subfamilies, 17 [[genera]] and 46 [[species]] in total in this very common group of mammals. Moles have poor vision. 
 
 The largest type of mole is the [[Russian desman]]. The smallest type of mole is the [[American shrew mole]].
