 ==History== 
 Herat dates back to very old times.

 [[Arabs]] took Herat in 660 AD, and it became a center of the [[Muslim]] world. Herat has a long history as a centre for [[Sufism]], the mystical branch of [[Islam]]. It became part of the area then known as [[Khurasan]], which reached its peak of civilization in the twelfth century. In 1221 AD, it was taken by the [[Mongols]] and later destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur]], the [[Turkic]] conqueror, took it in about 1393 AD. Herat’s greatest era was during the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid rule]], when it was a centre of science and culture. As the capital of the Timurid empire, it boasted many fine religious buildings and was famous for its sumptuous court life and musical performance and its tradition of [[miniature]] paintings. Later [[Persians]] and [[Afghans]] fought over the control of the city and Herat changed hands several times before it (under [[British]] interference) permanently became part of Afghanistan in 1857 under the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]]. < ref > [Encyclopedia Britannica, Herat.
