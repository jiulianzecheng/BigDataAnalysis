 The '''Muldentalkreis''' was a district in the [[Free State of Saxony]], [[Germany]]. It ended in 2008. 
 
 The district was formed in 1994 when the two old districts of [[Grimma]] and [[Wurzen]] were joined together. A few municipalities from other districts around [[Bad Lausick]] were added as well. 
 
 == Geography == 
 The district is named after its major river, the ''[[Mulde]]'' - the name {{lang-de|Muldental}} means {{lang-en|Valley of the Mulde}}. The Mulde is starts in the south of the district where two smaller rivers, the ''Freiberger Mulde'' and the ''Zwickauer Mulde'' join.
