 '''Parmenides''' (also '''Parmenides of Elea''') ({{lang-el|Παρμενίδης ο Ἐλεάτης}}, early 5th century BC) was an [[ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] born in [[Elea]], Italy and was the founder of the [[Eleatic school]] of [[philosophy]]. His only known work is a [[poem]], but only bits and pieces have survived. In it, he describes two views of [[reality]]. These thoughts strongly influenced [[Plato]], and later, the whole of [[western philosophy]]. His philosophy was based on materialistic [[monism]]. Materialistic monism is the belief that everything in the universe is made of a single substance. Parmenides' biggest argument was that change does not exist. Parmenides' explanation is that we think we see change, but our senses are not reliable, and they create the illusion of change.
