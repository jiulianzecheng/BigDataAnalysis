The '''Endocardium''' is the innermost layer of [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] which lines the inside of the [[heart]]. It plays a role in controlling the function of the myocardium, the heart muscle. The endocardium is made of simple [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells similar to those which line blood vessels. 
 
 In addition to lining the inside of the heart, the endocardium also regulates [[heart contraction]]s and aids cardiac [[embryo]] development.
