A '''resonator''' is something that [[resonate]]s.  This may make a particular [[frequency]] of a sound or other [[vibration]] become bigger.

 In electromagnetics a '''cavity resonator''' is a resonator composed of a space that is usually surrounded by a [[dielectric]] or [[metal]] which allows standing wave patterns at particular frequencies, [[eigenmodes]], correlated to their size, shape, and material. 
 
 ==Music== 
 Most [[musical instrument]]s have resonators.  They are the parts which makes the sound louder.  A [[vibraphone]], for example, has long tubes underneath the keys.  It also has a special effect: a mechanism which, when it is turned on, opens and shuts the resonators very quickly so that a trembling sound is heard. 
 
 The body of a [[violin]] is a resonator: without the body the sound of the string vibrating would hardly be heard, just as the sound of an [[elastic band]] stretched between two [[finger]]s can hardly be heard.
