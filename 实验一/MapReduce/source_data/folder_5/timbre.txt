'''Timbre''' is a quality of [[sound]]. It is what makes two different [[musical instruments]] sound different from each other, even when each instrument plays the same musical note. 
 
 " Playing the same note "  means they have the same [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[loudness]]. For instance, timbre is the difference between a [[guitar]] and a [[piano]] playing the same note at the same volume. In music, ''tone quality'' and ''color'' are [[synonyms]] for timbre. 
 
 There are many attempts by music theorists to explain timbre more fully. Unfortunately, their ideas depend on the reader having an advanced knowledge of musical theory. The ''Acoustical Society of America'' (ASA) Acoustical Terminology definition 12.09 of timbre is  " that attribute of auditory sensation which enables a listener to judge that two nonidentical sounds, similarly presented and having the same [[loudness]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], are dissimilar " . It adds  " Timbre depends primarily upon the [[frequency]] spectrum, although it also depends upon the sound pressure and the temporal characteristics of the sound " . < ref > {{cite news|last1=ASA Standards Secretariat|title=Acoustical Terminology ANSI S1.1-1994 (ASA 111-1994)|work=American National Standard|publisher=ANSI / Acoustical Society of America|date=1994|ref=ANSI S1.1-1994 / ASA 111-1994}} < /ref >
