 '''Silverstone''' is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]]. It is about {{convert|4|mi|km|1}} from [[Towcester]] on the former A43 main road, {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} from the [[M1 motorway]] junction 15A and about {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} from the [[M40 motorway]] junction 10, [[Northampton]], [[Milton Keynes]] and [[Banbury]].  The A43 now bypasses to the south-east of the village, between the village and the race circuit. 
 
 == History == 
 The village is listed in the [[Domesday Book]]. 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]] the village trade was primarily in [[Lumber|timber]] from the surrounding [[Whittlewood Forest|Whittlewood forest]], through the use of coppicing. Coppicing is a method of managing a forest. It allows [[tree]]s to regrow after they have been cut down.  
 
 == Parish church == 
 [[File:St Michael's, Silverstone - geograph.org.uk - 143165.jpg|thumb|left|200px|St. Michael's church]] 
 
 The first chapel in Silverstone was built by 1200 AD. < ref name=ACNY > {{cite web |url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/silverstone-st-michael0/ |title=St Michael, Silverstone |author= |work=A Church Near You |publisher=[[The Church of England]] |accessdate=15 October 2010}} < /ref >  In about 1780 the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] building was replaced by a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building. That building was enlarged in 1841 and 1852. < ref name=ACNY/ >  The entire church was demolished (torn down) < ref name=ACNY/ >  in the 1880's and replaced by the present [[Church of England]] parish church of [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]]. The building is a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] designed by [[James Piers St Aubyn|JP St Aubyn]]. It was finished in 1884. < ref > Pevsner  &  Cherry, 1973, page 404 < /ref > 
 
 == Facilities == 
 The village has a [[public house]], the White Horse Inn. 
 
 About {{convert|0.5|mi|km|0}} south of the village is the [[Silverstone Circuit]]. It was a [[Royal Air Force]] bomber base during [[World War II]]. Now it is the home of the [[British Grand Prix]], a [[Formula One]] race. The race track attracts more than 300,000 visitors each year.
