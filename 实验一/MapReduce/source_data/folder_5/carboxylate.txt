 A '''carboxylate''' is the [[conjugate base]] of a [[carboxylic acid]], RCOO− (or RCO−2). It is an [[ion]] with negative charge. Carboxylate ions are made when a carboxylic acid loses a hydrogen ion. Such [[acid]]s usually have [[pKa]] of less than 5, meaning that many [[base]]s, such as [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[sodium bicarbonate]] can remove the [[hydrogen|hydrogen ions]] from them. 
 
 RCOOH + NaOH → RCOONa + H2O 
 ==Examples==

 * [[Formate|Formate ion]], HCOO− 
 * [[Acetate|Acetate ion]], CH3COO− 
 * [[Methanetetracarboxylate|Methanetetracarboxylate ion]], C(COO−)4 
 * [[Oxalate|Oxalate ion]], (COO)2−
