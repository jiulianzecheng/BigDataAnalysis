 '''Transport''', or '''transportation''', is moving people or things from one place to another place. < ref > Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/nani/index.html   " What is transport? " ]; retrieved 2012-9-5. < /ref >  Transport can be divided into ''[[infrastructure]]'', ''[[vehicle]]s'' and ''[[operations]]''. 
 
 ''Infrastructure'' includes cableways, [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airport]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline]]s. The infrastructure is the [[network]] where things are carried. Infrastructure also includes [[airport]]s, [[railway station]]s, [[bus station]]s and [[seaport]]s (docks). Infrastructure is usually built by [[government]]s and paid for by [[tax]]es from the citizens of a country or region. Infrastructure such as roads and railways are designed by [[civil engineer]]s and [[urban planner]]s. 
 
 ''Vehicles'' or vessels travel on the infrastructure. Vehicles include [[cable car]]s, [[car]]s, [[truck]]s, [[Railway|trains]], spaceships and [[airplane]]s. Vehicles are usually designed by [[mechanical engineer]]s. Vessels include [[boat]]s, [[ferry|ferries]], and [[barge]]s which travel on canals and use docks and seaports. In the same way that trains use train stations, [[airplane]]s use airports. In the same way that trains use railway lines (train tracks), [[airplane]]s use flight paths and then fly in the sky. < ref > Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/sora/06_michi.html  " There are paths even in the air " ]; retrieved 2012-9-5. < /ref > 
 
 ''Operations'' control the system. Operations include [[traffic signal]]s, [[railway signal]]s and [[air traffic control]]. Operations also include the government [[policy|policies]] (a policy is a plan of action to guide decisions and actions) and [[regulation]]s (a set or group of laws and rules) used to control the system, such as [[toll road|tolls]], fuel taxes, and traffic laws. 
 
 == Transport and communications == 
 Transport and [[communication]] can be used instead of each other (someone could [[telephone]] a person rather than visit them). Transport [[traffic]] also needs communication.  For example, [[air traffic control]] lets more airplanes fly. So, an increase of either transport or communication usually leads to an increase in the other one.  
 
 == Transport, energy, and the environment == 
 Transport uses a lot of [[energy]]. Trams, trolleybuses and trains use electricity and cycling is human-powered. Most transport uses [[hydrocarbon]]s ([[oil]] and [[gas]]). This can create [[pollution]]. Environmental regulations (laws) and low-pollution fuels (for example liquified natural gas) can reduce pollution. But as more vehicles are used, more pollution is created.  [[Ethanol]] and biodiesel [[pollute]] less than [[petroleum]]. 
 
 == Kinds of transportation ==

 Transport can be by cable, land, water or air: 
 * Cable using cableways. e.g. [[cable car]]s and [[ski lift]]s etc. 
 * [[Land transport]] using walking, [[road]]s and [[railway]] tracks  < ref > Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/riku/index.html  " Land vehicles " ]; retrieved 2012-9-5. < /ref >  by bicycles and other [[vehicle]]s. e.g. buses, cars, trucks, trains, trams, bikes etc.  
 * Water transport using [[ship]]s and  [[barge]]s in [[canal]]s and in [[river]]s and [[sea]]s  < ref > Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/umi/index.html   " Sea vehicles " ]; retrieved 2012-9-5. < /ref >  e.g. ships, submarines, jet skis etc.  
 * Air [[transportation]] using airplanes and airports and [[helicopter]] < nowiki/ > s. < ref > Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/sora/index.html   " Air vehicles " ]; retrieved 2012-9-5. < /ref >  e.g. jets, aeroplanes etc.  
 * [[Pipeline]]
