 '''Scalping''' is the act of removing the [[scalp]], or a part of the scalp, from a dead body or another living person. The scalp would serve as a [[trophy]] from [[battle]] or [[proof]] of a [[Warrior|warrior's]] skill. Scalping was also done for money, when the scalper was given a certain amount of money as a [[reward]] for each scalp of the enemy they acquired. 
 
 Scalping was often done during the [[colonisation]] of [[North America]]. It was practised by certain nations of [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native Americans]], but this was not the norm. < ref > ''World of the American Indian'', by Jules B. Billard, National Geographic Society; First Printing edition (1974), Washington, D.C. < /ref >  It was also done by European colonists. Some [[United States]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] territories paid [[wikt:bounty|bounties]] for enemy Native American scalps. < ref > [[William Brandon (author)|William Brandon]] and Keith Rosenberg, Native American specialists, ''The American Heritage Book of Indians'' (1961). < /ref > 
 
 In [[Australia]], scalping of [[dingo]]s was a widespread form of bounty hunting. It began in 1912, when the government of [[South Australia]] decided to pay people money for dingo scalps, to reduce attacks on [[livestock]]. This was also done in [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]]. < ref name= " Keen " > {{cite book|editor=Ian Keen|title=Indigenous participation in Australian economies: Historical and anthropological perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IhO9UdBfU4C & pg=PA91|accessdate=29 March 2012|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-921666-86-5|pages=91â€“}} < /ref >
