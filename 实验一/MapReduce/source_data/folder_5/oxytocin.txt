 '''Oxytocin''' is a [[hormone]] found in [[mammal]]s. It is a [[peptide hormone]] and [[neuropeptide]]. It acts on the [[brain]]. In [[human]]s it is released during female [[reproduction]], especially during and after [[childbirth]]. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Oxytocin {{ndash}} the great facilitator of life|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.04.001|last1=Lee|first1=Heon-Jin|last2=MacBeth|first2=Abbe H.|last3=Pagani|first3=Jerome|last4=Young|first4=W. Scott|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|volume=88|issue=2|pages=127–151|pmid=19482229|pmc=2689929}} < /ref >   
 
 It has other effects. It encourages [[Human bonding|pair bonding]], and parental behaviour. It is released during intimate moments during [[orgasm]]s and even hugs. For this reason it is often called the 'love hormone'. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8020464/Oxytocin-the-love-hormone-could-cure-shyness.html|title=Oxytocin {{ndash}} The love hormone that could cure shyness|publisher=the Daily Telegraph|access-date=2018-04-01|archive-date=2014-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817125011/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8020464/Oxytocin-the-love-hormone-could-cure-shyness.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Strange to say, the oxytocin released by the [[pituitary gland]] cannot reach the brain: it does have effects on the rest of the body. The reason is that there is a [[blood{{ndash}}brain barrier|blood–brain barrier]] which prevents large molecules from getting into the brain. Instead, the hormone is produced by special nerve cells inside the brain. < ref name= " Ross " > {{Cite journal|author=Ross HE |title=Characterization of the oxytocin system regulating affiliative behavior in female prairie voles |journal=Neuroscience |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=892–903 |year=2009 |pmid=19482070 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.05.055 |pmc=2744157|author2=Cole CD|author3=Smith Y|display-authors=3|last4=Neumann|first4=I.D.|last5=Landgraf|first5=R.|last6=Murphy|first6=A.Z.|last7=Young|first7=L.J.}} < /ref >   
 
 Oxytocin is also released through the use of recreational [[drugs]] like [[MDMA]] and some prescription anti-depressants. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.biopsychiatry.com/|title=The Good Drug Guide : new mood-brighteners and antidepressants|website=www.biopsychiatry.com}} < /ref > 
 
 Oxytocin was the first [[polypeptide]] hormone to be [[sequence]]d and [[organic synthesis|synthesized]], by [[Vincent du Vigneaud]] and colleagues in 1953. < ref > {{Cite journal| author = du Vigneaud V. |display-authors = etal  | title = The synthesis of an octapeptide amide with the hormonal activity of oxytocin | journal = J.
