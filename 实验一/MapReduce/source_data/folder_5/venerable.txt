 '''The Venerable''' is used as a style in several [[Christianity|Christian churches]]. It is also the common [[English language|English-language]] translation of a number of [[Buddhist]] titles.

 In the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], ''The Venerable,'' is the style used for a person who has been posthumously declared  " [[Heroic virtue|heroic in virtue]] "  during the investigation and process leading to possible [[canonization]] as a saint.  Before a person is  considered to be ''venerable,'' he or she must be declared as such by a proclamation, approved by the [[Pope]], of having lived a life that was  " heroic in virtue "  â€“ the virtues being the [[Theological Virtues]] of faith, hope, and charity and the [[Cardinal Virtues]] of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.  The next step is [[beatification]], at which point the person is referred to as ''The Blessed'', and finally [[canonization]], at which point the person is referred to as ''[[Saint]]''. Two modern and well-known examples of those who have been declared venerable are Popes [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and [[Pius XII]], who were both declared venerable by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in December 2009, and who are likely to be beatified soon. 
 
 The 7-8th-century English monk [[St. Bede]] was referred to as being ''venerable'' soon after his death and, by tradition, is therefore often referred to as  " the Venerable Bede "  despite his also having been canonized.  St Bede was the first person to be recorded as ''The Venerable''.
