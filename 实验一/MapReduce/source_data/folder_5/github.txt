 ==Organizational users== 
 Currently, there are many individual GitHub users. On the other hand, there are also organizational users such as educational institutions < ref > Griffin, T.,  &  Seals, S. (2013). Github in the classroom: Not just for group projects. Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 28(4), 74-74. < /ref > < ref > Fiksel, J., Jager, L. R., Hardin, J. S.,  &  Taub, M. A. (2019).

Using GitHub as a teaching tool for programming courses. In ASEE Gulf-Southwest Section Annual Meeting 2018 Papers. American Society for Engineering Education. < /ref >  and companies. The following companies are using GitHub to distribute [[open source]] projects: 
 * [[Facebook]] < ref > {{URL|https://github.com/facebook}} < /ref > 
 * Google Research (research facility of [[Google]]) < ref > {{URL|https://github.com/google-research}} < /ref > 
 * [[IBM]] < ref > {{URL|https://github.com/IBM}} < /ref >

 * [[Wolfram Research]] (developer of [[Wolfram Mathematica]]) < ref > {{URL|https://github.com/WolframResearch}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Desktop version== 
 GitHub was made for users who want to save their programs on their [[web browser]]s. But there is also a desktop version known as GitHub Desktop. < ref > Van Strien, D. (2016). An Introduction to Version Control Using GitHub Desktop. The Programming Historian. < /ref > 
 ==GitHub Pages== 
 All GitHub users can create [[website]]s with the '''github.io''' domain. This service is known as '''GitHub Pages'''. < ref > Owen, D. (2017). Using GitHub pages for a computer science course website: conference tutorial. Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 32(3), 36-36. < /ref >  The development history of the [[HTML]] code will be recorded with Git. 
 ==Similar services== 
 Today, there are several GitHub like services for developers. Some of them use Git but have different interface with unique web-design. One of the most famous GitHub rival is '''GitLab'''. < ref > Van Baarsen, J. (2014). GitLab Cookbook. Packt Publishing Ltd. < /ref > < ref > O'grady, A. (2018). GitLab Quick Start Guide: Migrate to GitLab for all your repository management solutions. Packt Publishing Ltd. < /ref >  This is also based on Git. Users can export their programs on GitHub to GitLab.
