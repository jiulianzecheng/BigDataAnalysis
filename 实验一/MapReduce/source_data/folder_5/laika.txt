 [[File:Posta_Romana_-_1959_-_Laika_120_B.jpg|thumb|300px|Laika, first dog launched into space, on 1959 postage stamp from [[Romania]].]] 
 '''Laika''' ({{lang-ru|Лайка}};{{efn|Laika, meaning  " Barker "  in Russian, is also the name of several [[dog breeds]].}} c. 1954 – November 3, 1957) was a [[Soviet Union]] space dog.  She was one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to [[orbit]] the Earth. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/17764-laika-first-animals-in-space.html|title=Laika the Dog  &  the First Animals in Space|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=September 22, 2014}} < /ref >  She was a mix of either a [[Siberian Husky]] or other [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] breed, and a [[terrier]]. [[NASA]] refers to Laika as a  " part-[[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]] terrier. " < ref > [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1957-002A Sputnik 2]. National Space Science Data Center. Accessed April14, 2015. < /ref >  A dog was sent into space to get [[information]] about the [[behavior]] of living [[organism]]s in a space [[environment]]. Information from the flight led to the discovery of solar (from the sun) and cosmic [[radiation]]. 
 
 Laika had been a stray dog living in the streets of [[Moscow]]. She underwent training with two other dogs. She was then chosen as the dog to go up in the Soviet spacecraft [[Sputnik 2]]. It was launched into outer space on November 3, 1957. 
 
 == Fate of Laika known == 
 Not much was known about how [[spaceflight]] would affect living animals at the time of Laika's mission. There was also no way, at that time, to bring the [[satellite (artificial)|satellite]] back down to Earth. So all the scientists knew there would be no way for Laika to survive her trip. It was necessary to send a dog first as a test, because it was not thought that humans could live in outer space. < ref name=RussiaOpensMonument/ > 
 
 Before her trip in Sputnik, one of the scientists took Laika home to play with his children. Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky wrote:  " Laika was quiet and charming...I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.

 One of the technicians getting the capsule ready before final lift-off said that  " after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her ''bon voyage'', knowing that she would not survive the flight.

 ==Death in space == 
 Laika died within hours from [[Hyperthermia|overheating]].  Her body [[temperature]] got way too hot for her to survive. < ref name= " DM " > {{cite journal|title=Abstract:Some Unknown Pages of the Living Organisms' First Orbital Flight|author=Malashenkov, D. C.|year=2002|publisher=[[Astrophysics Data System]]|bibcode=2002iaf..confE.288M|page=288|journal=IAF Abstracts}} < /ref >  The heat in her spacecraft had quickly risen to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). < ref name=children / >  The true cause and time of her death were hidden from people until 2002.  Instead, it was reported that she died when her [[oxygen]] ran out on day six. < ref name=Beischer1962 > {{cite journal |author=Beischer, DE; Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space.

 In the Soviet Union, during the following years, no one openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. It was not until 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that Oleg Gazenko, one of the top-level scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, said he was sorry for allowing her to die: < ref > Dick Abadzis, afterword to ''Laika'', First Second, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59643-302-7}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.moscowanimals.org/laika/laika.html|publisher=Moscow Animals|title=The Story of Laika|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816092218/http://www.moscowanimals.org/laika/laika.html|accessdate=3 November 2016|archive-date=2006-08-16}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Message from the First Dog in Space Received 45 Years Too Late|url=http://www.dogsinthenews.com/issues/0211/articles/021103a.htm|publisher=Dogs in the News|accessdate=3 November 2016|date=3 November 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108184335/http://www.dogsinthenews.com/issues/0211/articles/021103a.htm|archive-date=2006-01-08}} < /ref > 
 {{quote|Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it. We shouldn't have done it & nbsp;... We did not learn enough from this mission to justify the death of the dog.}} 
 
 == Return to Earth == 
 Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2 burned up—along with Laika's remains—during re-entry on April 14, 1958. < ref name= " MA " > {{cite web|url=http://www.moscowanimals.org/laika/laika.html|title=The Story of Laika| accessdate =August 28, 2014|publisher=moscowanimals.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816092218/http://www.moscowanimals.org/laika/laika.html |archivedate=2006-08-16|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Memorials and tribute == 
 On April 11, 2008, Russian officials opened a [[monument]] to Laika. It was built near the military research facility in [[Moscow]] which prepared Laika's space flight. It is of a dog standing on top of a rocket. < ref name=RussiaOpensMonument > {{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-04-11-177105809_x.htm |title=Russia opens monument to space dog Laika |author=Vladimir Isachenkov |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=August 28, 2014}} < /ref > < ref > " [http://vortex.accuweather.com/adc2004/pub/includes/columns/travel/2008/laika.jpg Laika] " .accuweather.com.
