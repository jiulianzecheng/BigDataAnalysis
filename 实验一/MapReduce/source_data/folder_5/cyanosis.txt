 '''Cyanosis''' is a medical problem.  When a person has cyanosis, their skin and [[mucous membrane]]s turn blue or purple.  Cyanosis is a sign that the cyanotic (blue) parts of the body are not getting enough [[blood]] and [[oxygen]]. < ref name= " Medline " > {{cite web|last=Dugdale|first=David|date=2013-04-21|title=Skin discoloration - bluish.|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003215.htm|access-date=2015-01-03|publisher=National Institutes of Health}} < /ref >  This can happen because there is not enough oxygen in the blood.  It can also happen when small [[blood vessel]]s in the body get smaller because of a medical problem (this is called [[vasoconstriction]]). < ref name=Medline / > 
 
 Usually cyanosis is first seen in the extremities (the parts of the body that are farthest away from the [[heart]]).  Usually the first parts of the body to become cyanotic are the fingertips (especially under the fingernails), the toes, the lips, the tip of the nose, and the earlobes. < ref > Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice Series: Assessment. Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins; 1 edition (2006) p.87 {{ISBN|1582559392}} < /ref >   
 As the body goes longer without oxygen, more of the body becomes cyanotic.
