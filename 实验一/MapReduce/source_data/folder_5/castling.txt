 '''Castling''' is a special move in [[chess]] that uses both a [[rook (chess)|rook]] and the [[king (chess)|king]]. In castling, the king is moved two squares toward the rook, and the rook moves past the king to the [[square]] right next to the king.  
 
 Castling takes one move, and is the only way for a player to move two of his own pieces on the same move. Castling can be done on either side of the board.  
 
 ==Rules for castling== 
 Castling is only possible if each of the following things are true: 
 
 *Neither the king nor the rook being used to castle have moved in the game. 
 *The king is not in check, and is not moving into check or through check. (It is okay if the rook is being attacked, though). 
 *There are no pieces between the king and the rook. 
 
 == Benefits of castling == 
 Good players castle in most of their games. It is normally a good idea because it often moves the king into a safer place. The [[middle]] of the [[board]] is normally not a safe place for the king to be in the game. Castling also makes it easier to get the rook into the game. Castling king-side is generally viewed as being safer, and is more common than castling on the Q-side.  
 
 Castling was part of the changes made to the original version of chess. As the power of the pieces were increased, the kings had to be given a means of escape. Instead of being in the heat of battle, they needed to be tucked safely away. These changes were made in the 15th century (see [[history of chess]]).
