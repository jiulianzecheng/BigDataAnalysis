Pre-prints which has been approved by peer-review are [[academic journal]]s.  < /ref >  All documents are stored as [[PDF]]. 
 ==Importance== 
 Generally, all scientific journals have peer-review procedures. This process sometimes take several years. The time lag made by this process will easily cause delay to the scientific community. arXiv was made to avoid this delay. 
 ==Usage at Wikipedia etc.== 
 {{see also|Template:Cite arXiv}} 
 [[Wikipedia]] and some journals accept citations by arXiv. Some academic [[search engine]]s (such as [[Google Scholar]]) can help users to find arXiv pre-prints. 
 ==Scientific areas== 
 arXiv includes pre-prints from various scientific fields such as:
