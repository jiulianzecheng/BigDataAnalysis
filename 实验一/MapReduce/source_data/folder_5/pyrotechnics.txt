 '''Pyrotechnics''' is often thought to be [[Synonym|synonymous]] with the [[manufacture]] of [[fireworks]], but it also includes items for [[military]] and [[industry|industrial]] uses.  
 
 Items such as [[safety match]]es, [[oxygen candle]]s, [[explosive bolt]]s and fasteners and the [[airbag|automobile safety airbag]] all fall under pyrotechnics. Without pyrotechnics, modern [[aviation]] and [[spaceflight]] would be impracticable. 
 
 This is because pyrotechnic devices combine high [[reliability]] with very compact and efficient [[energy]] [[storage]]. 
 
 A pyrotechnic show is a pre-planned complex that includes ground and high-altitude fireworks. Sometimes such events are accompanied by the performance of specially trained artists of the original genre with pyrotechnic equipment. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What is a pyrotechnic show|url=https://neva-salut.com/posts/chto-takoe-pirotekhnicheskoe-shou|access-date=|website=}} < /ref >
