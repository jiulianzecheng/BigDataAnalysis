'''Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɡaːiʊs sweːˈtoːniʊs traŋˈkᶣɪlːʊs|lang}}), commonly known as '''Suetonius''' ({{IPAc-en|s|w|ɪ|ˈ|t|oʊ|n|i|ə|s}} {{respell|swih|TOH|nee|əs}}; c. AD 69  & ndash; after AD 122), < ref > {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Suetonius |access-date=15 May 2017 |title=Suetonius |author=((The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica ))|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}} < /ref >  was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[historian]]. His most important work is called ''De Vita Caesarum,'' or ''Lives of the Caesars''. It includes the biographies of twelve successive Roman rulers, from [[Julius Caesar]] to [[Domitian]]. 
 
 Suetonius was born when [[Vespasian]] was emperor, so scholars say he must have been born before 79 c.e.  His father was from Rome's equestrian [[social class]].  He worked as a secretary for Emperor [[Hadrian]] but he was accused of something having to do with the empress Sabina and was forced to retire in 121 c.e.  He wrote ''De Vita Caesarum'' after that. 
 
 Westerners during the medieval and early modern periods thought ''De Vita Caesarum'' was a very good book.  Many scholars have read and translated it.  It has been printed in more than 100 separate versions since 1500 a.d. < ref name= " Tufts " > {{cite web|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=June 29, 2020|title=C.
