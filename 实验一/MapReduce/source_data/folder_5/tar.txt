 '''Tar''' is a [[viscosity|sticky]] black [[liquid]] made of thick [[oil]]. It is a natural substance, oozing out of the ground in places like the [[La Brea tar pits]]. Usually it is made by heating [[coal]] inside a chemical apparatus. 
 
 Most tar is produced from [[coal]] as a byproduct of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production, but it can also be produced from [[petroleum]], [[peat]] or [[wood]]. The  " destructive distillation "  of a ton of [[coal]] can produce 700 & nbsp;kg of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], 100 litres of [[Ammonium hydroxide|liquor ammonia]], 50 litres of [[coal tar]] and 400 m < sup > 3 < /sup >  of [[coal gas]]. 
 
 It used to be one of the products of [[gasworks]]. Tar made from coal or petroleum is considered [[toxic]]. It [[carcinogenic|causes cancer]] because of its high [[benzene]] content. In low concentrations, however, tar is used as a medicine on the skin. 
 
 '''Tar kilns''' are dry distillation ovens, used in [[Scandinavia]] for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole, to allow the tar to come out. The wood is split to dimensions of a finger and stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss to stop air entering. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out, and continues to do so for a few days. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Tar is used in treatment of the skin disease [[psoriasis]], where coal tar is the most effective. Tar is a general disinfectant. Petroleum tar was also used in [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Mummy|mummification]] circa 1000 BC.{{ref|www.geotimes.org.feb05}} 
 
 Tar was a vital component of the first sealed, or  " [[tarmac]] " , roads. The streets of [[Baghdad]] were the first to be paved with tar from the 8th century AD. < ref name=Ajram > {{cite book|author=Dr. Kasem Ajram|title=The Miracle of Islam Science|url=https://archive.org/details/miracleofislamic0000ajra|edition=2nd|publisher=Knowledge House Publishers|year=1992|isbn=0-911119-43-4}} < /ref >  It was also used as seal for roofing [[shingle]]s and to seal the hulls of [[ship]]s and [[boat]]s. For millennia wood tar was used to waterproof [[sail]]s and boats, but today sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have negated the need for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well painting exterior walls of log buildings. 
 
 Mixing tar with [[linseed oil]] [[varnish]] produces tar paint. Tar paint can be used to protect wood from weather. Tar paint can also be toned with various pigments, producing translucent colours and preserving the wood texture.
