 The '''Euphrates''' is the western of the two [[river]]s that define the borders of [[Mesopotamia]]. The other is the [[Tigris]], which joins the Euphrates to form the [[Shatt-al-Arab]] and flow into the [[Persian Gulf]]. Several [[dam]]s have been built since the [[1970s]]. As a result, less water flows down the river into the [[sea]].  
 The Euphrates, along with the Tigris, were very important to ancient Mesopotamians because they would provide water and irrigation. It is 1,728 miles long and is one of the longest rivers in all of Mesopotamia. It is slower than the Tigris river but at the same time longer.
