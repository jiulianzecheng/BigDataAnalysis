 The family '''Asteraceae''' or '''Compositae''' (the '''aster''', '''daisy''', or '''sunflower''' family) is the largest family of [[flowering plant]]s. It has the most [[species]].  
 
 What looks like its flower is really made of  hundreds or thousands of tiny individual flowers. The technical term for it is a [[pseudanthium]] ( " false flower " ).  
 
 The driving force for the evolution of the Asteraceae was that the composite flowers look attractive to pollinating insects. A large brightly coloured flower attracts insects. The other quality insects like is the [[scent]] of the [[pollen]] and the sugary [[nectar]] in the flowers. The asters are very successful (over 32,000 known species of flowering plants in over 1,900 [[genera]] in the order Asterales). Their success is due to what they offer to visiting insects. It is also due to their ability to grow almost anywhere, but especially on [[grass]]. < ref > Judd W.S; Campbell C.S; Kellogg E.A.; Stevens P.F; Donaghue M.J. 2007.

 Heterocarpy, or amphicarpy, the ability of an annual species to produce different fruit [[morph]]s, is common in Asteraceae. It allows seeds to be dispersed over varying distances, each type adapted to different environment. This increases the chances of survival. < ref name=Gardocki > Gardocki, Mary E.; Zablocki, Heather; El-Keblawy, Ali; Freeman, D. Carl 2000.
