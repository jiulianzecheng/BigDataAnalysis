 '''Cyanobacteria''' are a [[taxon]] of [[bacteria]] which conduct [[photosynthesis]]. They are not [[algae]], though they were once called '''blue-green algae'''. It is a [[phylum]] of [[bacteria]], with about 1500 [[species]]. In [[endosymbiont]] theory, [[chloroplasts]] (plastids) are descended from cyanobacteria. Their [[DNA]] profile is evidence for this. < ref > Sapp J. 1994. ''Evolution by association: a history of symbiosis''. Oxford. < /ref > < ref > Giovannoni S.J. ''et al'' 1988.

 Cyanobacteria have an extremely long [[fossil]] record, starting  at least 3,500 million years ago. They were the main organisms in the [[stromatolite]]s of the [[Archaean]] and [[Proterozoic]] [[eon]]s. < ref > Knoll, Andrew H. 2004.

 The ability of cyanobacteria to perform oxygenic [[photosynthesis]] is highly significant. The early [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere on Earth]] was largely [[reducing agent|reducing]], that is, without [[oxygen]]. The cyanobacteria in stromatolites were the first known organisms to photosynthesise and produce free [[oxygen]]. After about a [[billion]] years, the effect of this photosynthesis began a huge change in the atmosphere. The process, called the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], took a long time. Eventually, it killed off most of the organisms which could not live in oxygen, and led to the kinds of environment we know today, where most organisms use and need oxygen. < ref > Frei R.

 == Light detection == 
 Cyanobacteria have a way of detecting light. Conrad Mullineaux, of Queen Mary University of London, said,  " It has a way of detecting where the light is; we know that because of the direction that it moves " . < ref name=BBC > Webb, Jonathan 2016. Bacteria 'see' like tiny eyeballs. ''BBC News''  Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35502310] < /ref > 
 : " In a single-celled [[pond]] [[slime]], they observed how incoming rays are bent by the bug's [[spherical]] surface and focused in a spot on the far side of the cell. By shuffling along in the opposite direction to that bright spot, the microbe moves towards the light " . < ref name=BBC/ >
