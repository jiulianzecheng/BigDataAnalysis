 '''Halothane''', aka '''Fluothane''', is a general [[anesthetic]] used to induce or maintain [[Anesthetic|anesthesia]]. Its systematic name is 2-Bromo-2-Chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane.  
 
 It was discovered in 1955 and approved for medical use in 1958.  
 
 It was replaced with newer anaesthetics such as [[isoflurane]] and [[enflurane]] in the more developed countries. In some severe cases after repeated exposure, it lead to a severe [[liver]] injury. Also, the concern about [[hepatitis]] helped make the decision to not use halothane for adults in the 1980s and the 1990s for children.
