 A '''catapult''' is a type of [[machine]] used as a [[weapon]] to throw [[mineral|rocks]], large arrows, or other things such as hot tar, that would cause damage to something else. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Hacker |first1=Barton C. |title=Greek Catapults and Catapult Technology: Science, Technology, and War in the Ancient World |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_technology-and-culture_1968-01_9_1/page/34 |journal=Technology and Culture |date=January 1968 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=34–50 |doi=10.2307/3102042 |jstor=3102042 |accessdate=6 July 2019}} < /ref >   Often, catapults were set on higher ground or on [[castle]] towers to let them shoot farther.  They shot rocks to break [[castle]] walls, or [[pitch]] or hot [[tar]] to set the target on [[fire]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Catapults |url=http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm |website=www.lordsandladies.org |accessdate=6 July 2019 |archive-date=24 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924235615/http://middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Catapults use weights and [[lever]]s to send the rocks or other things into the air. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Saimre |first1=Tanel |title=Trebuchet: A Gravity Operated Siege Engine |journal=Estonian Journal of Archaeology |year=2006 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–80 |doi=10.3176/arch.2006.1.03 |s2cid=160430733 |url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/va-arh/arch-2006-1-3.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2019}} < /ref >  They do not throw as far as [[modern]] weapons do, and are not useful in modern [[warfare]].  Catapults were common in the past, especially the [[Middle Ages]]. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Janin |first1=Hunt |last2=Carlson |first2=Ursula |title=Mercenaries in Medieval and Renaissance Europe |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4766-1207-2 |page=41}} < /ref > 
 
 Nowadays catapults are used to study old weapons, and as experiments (for example in physics or engineering classes). Some old ones are kept in [[museum]]s. 
 
 [[Aircraft carrier]]s use much more powerful steam catapults to throw airplanes into the air. < ref > {{cite web |title=Launch and Recovery: From Flywheels to Magnets |url=https://navalaviationnews.navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/08/05/launch-and-recovery-from-flywheels-to-magnets/ |website=Naval Aviation News |accessdate=6 July 2019 |archive-date=26 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226120706/http://navalaviationnews.navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/08/05/launch-and-recovery-from-flywheels-to-magnets/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
