 A '''planetarium''' is a [[theater]] built to show [[education]]al and [[entertainment|entertaining]] [[presentation]]s about [[astronomy]] and the [[night sky]]. They are also used for training in [[celestial]] [[navigation]]. A main part of most planetariums is the large dome-shaped [[screen]] onto which [[image]]s of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and other [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] can be shown and made to move to show the 'motions of the heavens'. The celestial scenes can be created using many different [[technology|technologies]]. These include 'star balls' that combine [[optics|optical]] and [[Electromechanics|electro-mechanical]] technology, [[slide projector]], [[video]], full dome [[projector]] systems, and [[laser]]s. These technologies are used together to give an accurate image of the motion of the sky. Common systems can be set to show the sky at any point in time, past or present. They often show the night sky as it would appear from any point of [[latitude]] on [[Earth]].  
 
 There are many different sizes of planetariums. They can be as large as the [[Hayden Planetarium]]'s 21-meter dome. It seats 423 people. They can also be as small as a three-meter portable domes where children sit on the floor. These portable planetariums are used for education presentations outside of the permanent planetariums at [[museum]]s and [[science]] centers. 
 
 The term ''planetarium'' is sometimes used to mean other things which show the [[Solar System|solar system]]. These include [[computer simulation]]s or an [[orrery]]. Planetarium [[software]] refers to software that creates a [[3D|three dimensional]] image of the sky on a [[two dimensional]] [[computer screen]]. The term ''planetarian'' is used for someone who works at a planetarium. The [[plural]] of planetarium is either planetariums or planetaria.
