 The '''Maghreb''' ({{lang-ar|المغرب العربي}} {{unicode|'''al-Maġrib al-ʿArabī'''}}) < ref > also rendered ''[[Maghrib (disambiguation)|Maghrib]]'' (or rarely ''Moghreb''), meaning  " place of [[sunset]] "  or  " [[west]]ern "  in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] < /ref >  is the western part of the [[Arab world]]. It is in [[North Africa]]. The term is generally applied to all of [[Mauritania]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Libya]], but in older Arabic usage meant only the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia). Historically, some writers also included Muslim ruled regions in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]] in the definition. Malta, in particular, still speaks a language based on its own [[Maghrebi Arabic]] [[varieties of Arabic|variety]]: [[Maltese language|Maltese]].
