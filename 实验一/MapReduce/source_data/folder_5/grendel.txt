 '''Grendel''' is one of the three [[antagonist]]s in the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' (AD 700â€“1000). Grendel is usually taken to be some kind of [[monster]], but he is like a human in some ways. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2023-06-09|title=Grendel {{!}} Monster, Beowulf, Anglo-Saxon {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Grendel|access-date=2023-07-30|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=British Library|url=https://www.bl.uk/medieval-literature/articles/monsters-and-heroes-in-beowulf|access-date=2023-07-30|website=www.bl.uk|archive-date=2023-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230730204900/https://www.bl.uk/medieval-literature/articles/monsters-and-heroes-in-beowulf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 In the poem, Grendel is feared by all but [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], who kills him and his mother at the end of the poem. He is the descendant of the [[biblical]] murderer [[Cain]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 ''Grendel'', a [[novel]] by John C. Gardner, was published in 1971. It tells much of the Beowulf story as if Grendel himself were talking. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2023-07-17|title=John Gardner {{!}} Novelist, Poet, Educator {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Gardner|access-date=2023-07-30|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref >
