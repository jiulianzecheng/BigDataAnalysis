 '''Cartography''' is making [[map]]s. It is part of [[geography]]. How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using [[computer]]s and people usually see maps on [[computer screen]]s < nowiki/ > . Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer. 
 
 Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a whole country or world. Anyone can make a map, but cartographers spend their lives learning how to make better maps. 
 
 For many centuries maps were usually carefully [[Drawing|drawn]] onto paper or [[parchment]]. Now they are made on a [[computer]] which makes them look neater with accurate images. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Robinson| first1 = Arthur H.| last2 = Morrison| first2 = Joel L.| last3 = Muehrcke| first3 = Phillip C.| last4 = Kimerling| first4 = A.

 Maps are of two main types: 
 * General maps with a variety of features. 
 * [[Thematic map]]s with particular themes for specific audiences. < ref > {{cite book| last = Robinson| first = Arthur Howard| title = Early Thematic Mapping in the History of Cartography| url = https://archive.org/details/earlythematicmap0000robi| year = 1982| isbn = 978-0-226-72285-6 }} < /ref > 
 
 General maps are produced in a series. Governments produce them in larger-scale and smaller-scale maps of great detail. 
 
 Thematic maps are now very common. They are necessary to show spatial, [[cultural]] and social [[data]].
