 '''Huni''' was the last [[Pharaoh]] of [[Egypt]]ian Third dynasty. He was successor of [[Khaba]], and maybe Khaba's son. Huni established a fortress on the island of Elephantine, and he maybe built pyramid in Meidum. 
 
 One of officials of king [[Djoser]] was also named Huni, and it's possible that this man and pharaoh Huni are the same person.  
 
 Huni had two wives - [[Djefatnebti]] and [[Meresankh I]]. With Djefatnebti, he fathered [[Hetepheres I]], and with Meresankh he sired [[Sneferu]], his own successor. Sneferu became a king after Huni's death, and he married his half-sister Hetepheres. Huni's grandson - son of Sneferu - was pharaoh [[Khufu]], who built [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].
