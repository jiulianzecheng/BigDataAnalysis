 The '''lancelets''', also known as '''Cephalochordata''' or '''Leptocardii''', are a group of primitive [[chordate]]s which were formerly called ''Amphioxus''. It includes ''[[Pikaia]]''. 
 
 Lancelets are the modern survivors of an ancient chordate lineage, with a fossil record dating back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The lancelets are usually said to be the sister group of the [[craniata|craniate]]s. They are a small group of about 30 [[species]] in two [[genera]]. 
 
 Lancelets are usually found buried in sand in shallow parts of [[temperate]] or [[tropics|tropical]] [[sea]]s. In [[Asia]], they are harvested commercially as [[food]] for [[human]]s and [[Domestication|domesticated animal]]s. They are an important object of study in [[zoology]] as they give indications about the origin of [[vertebrate]]s. < ref > Gee, Henry 2008. Evolutionary biology: The amphioxus unleashed.

 Lancelets serve as an intriguing comparison point for tracing how vertebrates have [[evolved]] and [[adapted]]. Although lancelets split from vertebrates more than 520 million years ago, their [[genome]]s hold clues about evolution, particularly how vertebrates have employed old genes for new functions. < ref > [http://newswise.com/articles/view/541865/ Worm-like marine animal providing fresh clues about human evolution] Newswise, Retrieved on July 8, 2008. < /ref >  They are regarded as similar to the [[archetype|archetypal]] vertebrate form.
