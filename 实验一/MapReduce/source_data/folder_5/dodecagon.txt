[[File:Dodecagon.svg|thumb|A dodecagon]] 
 A '''dodecagon''' or '''12-gon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 12 sides and 12 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular dodecagon == 
 All sides of a '''regular dodecagon''' are the same length. Each corner is 150°. All corners added together equal 1800°. 
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular dodecagon takes up is 
 
 : < math > \begin{align} A  &  = 3 \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{12} \right) a^2 = 
                      3 \left(2+\sqrt{3} \right) a^2 \\ 
                   &  \approx 11{,}19615\,a^2. 
  \end{align} < /math > 
 :The [[variable]] ''A'' represents the area, and the variable ''a'' represents the [[apothem]]. 
 
 === Perimeter === 
 The perimeter of a regular dodecagon is 
 
 < math > 
 \begin{align} P = 12s 
 \end{align} < /math > 
 
 The variable ''P'' represents the perimeter, and the variable ''s'' represents one side.{{Math-stub}}
