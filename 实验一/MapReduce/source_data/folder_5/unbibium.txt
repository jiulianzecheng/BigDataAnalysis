 '''Unbibium''', also known as '''element 122''' or '''eka-thorium''', is the possible [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] with the placeholder symbol of '''Ubb''' and [[atomic number]] 122. ''Unbibium'' and ''Ubb'' are the temporary [[Systematic element name|systematic IUPAC name and symbol]], which are used until the element is discovered, confirmed, and a permanent name is decided upon. In the [[periodic table]] of the elements, it is expected to follow [[unbiunium]] as the second element of the [[Superactinide|superactinides]] and the fourth element of the 8th [[Period (periodic table)|period]]. Similarly to unbiunium, it is expected to fall within the range of the [[island of stability]]. 
 
 Another alternative name is Diburnium
