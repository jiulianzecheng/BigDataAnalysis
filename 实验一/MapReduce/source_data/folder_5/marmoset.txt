 The '''marmosets''' are a group of [[New World monkey]]s. < ref name=msw3 > Groves C;  Wilson D.E. and Reeder D.M. (eds) 2005.

 There are 22 marmoset species in four [[genera]]. All are in the biological [[family (biology)|family]] [[Callitrichidae]]. The term ''marmoset'' is also used in reference to the [[Goeldi's marmoset]], ''Callimico goeldii'', which is closely related. 
 
 Most marmosets are about {{convert|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long. Compared to other [[monkey]]s, they have some [[basal|primitive]] features. They have [[claw]]s rather than [[nail (anatomy)|nail]]s, they lack [[wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]], and their [[brain]] layout seems to be relatively primitive. Their body temperature is unusually variable, changing by up to 4 & nbsp;°C (7 & nbsp;°F) in a day. < ref > Stafford, Grey 1999.

 Marmosets have [[germline chimerism]].

 Marmosets are highly active, living in the upper canopy of forest trees, and feeding on [[insect]]s, [[fruit]] and leaves.  They have long lower [[incisor]]s, which allow them to chew holes in tree trunks and branches to harvest the gum inside; some species are specialised feeders on [[natural gum|gum]]. 
 
 Marmosets live in family groups of three to 15. There are one or two breeding females, an unrelated male, offspring and other family members and unrelated individuals. Their mating systems are highly variable and include [[monogamy]], [[polygyny]] and occasionally [[polyandry]].
