 '''Talc''' (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''talk'') is a [[silicate mineral]], a type of [[clay]]. It is the standard for grade 1 in the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. A fingernail can easily scratch it. Talc is composed of hydrated [[magnesium]] [[silicate]] with the chemical formula Mg < sub > 3 < /sub > Si < sub > 4 < /sub > O < sub > 10 < /sub > (OH) < sub > 2 < /sub > . Talc and [[pyrophyllite]] are very similar, but pyrophyllite may be slightly harder. 
 
 Talc has a greasy feel and a translucent, soapy look. In loose form, it is the widely used substance known as talcum powder. [[Steatite]], also called [[soapstone]], is a rock with a lot of talc.
