 In [[Hinduism]], '''sadhu''' is a common term for an [[asceticism|ascetic]] or someone who practices [[yoga]] (''[[yogi]]''). Sadhus have given up trying to achieve the first three Hindu goals of life: [[Kama (Purusharthas)|kama]] (enjoyment), [[artha]] (practical objectives) and even [[dharma]] (duty). The sadhu is solely dedicated to achieving [[moksha]] (liberation) through [[meditation]] and contemplation of [[God]]. Sadhus often wear [[ochre]]-colored clothing, as a symbol that they have given up many things in life.
