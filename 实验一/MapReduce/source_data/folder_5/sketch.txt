 A '''sketch''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] σχέδιος - schedios  " temporary " ) < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sketch & searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary - Sketch|author=Douglas Harper}} < /ref >  is a fast freehand [[drawing]] that is not supposed to be a finished work. If in [[oil paint]] it is called an [[oil sketch]]. In general, a sketch is a quick way to practice an idea for later use. Artist's sketches usually serve as a way to try out different ideas and start a painting before starting a more finished work, especially when the finished work is costly and takes up time (as in the case of a large [[painting]] or [[fresco]]).  Sketching eases an artist's ability to focus on the most important parts of a subject and is a main part of artistic learning for students.
