 '''Claves''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] word: second '''e''' is sounded) are [[percussion instrument]]s. They are small wooden sticks made of [[tropical]] [[hardwood]]. They are used in pairs. They are traditionally heard in [[Cuban]] [[music]], e.g. [[salsa]]. < ref > Giro, Radamés 2007. ''Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba''. vol 1, p236. < /ref >   
 
 In Cuban music they often repeat a special [[rhythm]] called ''[[clave]]'' (pronounce:  " CLAH-ve " ). 
 
 The usual way of playing claves is to hold one clave lightly between the thumb and the fingertips with the palm of the hand facing upwards, or to cradle the clave in the hand. The other, held with the other hand, hits it.
