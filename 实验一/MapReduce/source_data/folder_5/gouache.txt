 '''Gouache''', also spelled guache, is a type of paint. It is also commonly called '''poster paint'''. It comprises [[pigment]], a [[binding agent]] (usually [[gum arabic]]), and some additives to make it [[opaque]]. An inert white pigment such as [[chalk]] is usually added. Gouache covers up whatever is underneath. [[Water colours]], in contrast, are somewhat [[transparent]]. 
 
 After gouache has dried, any form of paint can be used on the surface, also [[pastels]] and [[crayons]]. [[Watercolour]]s on top of a gouache surface are not so runny (fluid) as they are on plain paper.  
 
 The fast-drying quality of gouache makes it a favourite for ''en plein air'' (outdoor) paintings. It was also a favourite of [[J. M. W. Turner]].  
 
 Gouache also refers to paintings that use this type of paint.
