 An '''ecosystem''' (or ecological system) is a large community of living [[organisms]] (plants, animals and [[microbes]]) in a particular area. < ref > Molles, Manuel C. 1999. ''Ecology: concepts and applications''. Boston: WCB/McGraw-HIll. {{ISBN|0-07-042716-X}} < /ref >  The living and physical components are linked together through [[nutrient]] cycles and energy flows. < ref name= " Odum1971 " > Odum E.P. 1971. ''Fundamentals of ecology''. 3rd ed, New York: Saunders. {{ISBN|0534420664}} < /ref >  Ecosystems are of any size, but usually they are in particular places. 
 
 Each ecosystem has its own community. An [[aquarium]] community, for example, can have small fish and other organisms. A desert community may have cacti, small snakes, and scorpions. A pond community can have frogs, insects, snakes, and plants, and a forest community may have rabbits, foxes and pine trees. The species in a community are divided into [[populations]] according to the particular [[habitats]] and [[ecological niche]] < nowiki/ > s in the ecosystem.

 == Energy == 
 Ecosystems are [[stability|stable]], but changeable. They react to major changes in the environment, especially [[climate change]]s. For example, the major [[rainforest]]s have lasted for a long time (perhaps 50 million years or more in some cases). As the rainfall and temperature changes, they change. We know that the [[Amazon rainforest]] shrank in size during [[ice age]]s, and expanded in the warmer periods. 
 
 == Primary production == 
 What drives all ecosystems is the [[primary production]]. Primary production is the production of [[organic matter]] from [[inorganic]] [[carbon]] sources. This happens through [[photosynthesis]]. It drives the [[carbon cycle]], which influences global [[climate]] via the [[greenhouse effect]]. 
 
 Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from sunlight and use it to combine [[carbon dioxide]] and water to produce [[carbohydrate]]s and [[oxygen]]. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP). < ref name = Chapin/ >  About 48–60% of the GPP is consumed in plant [[respiration]]. The rest is known as the net primary production (NPP). < ref name = Chapin > Chapin F.S; Matson P.A.  &  Mooney H.A. 2002. ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology.'' New York: Springer, 97–104. {{ISBN|0-387-95443-0}} < /ref >  Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of [[leaf]] area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants limits photosynthesis), the supply of [[carbon dioxide]] and water, and suitable temperatures for carrying out [[photosynthesis]]. < ref name = Chapin/ >
