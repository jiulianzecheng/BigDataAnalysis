 '''Antinous''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɪ|n|oʊ|ʌ|s|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀντίνοος}}; {{circa|111}} – {{circa|130}}){{efn|The day and month of his birth come from an inscription on a tablet from [[Lanuvium]] dated 136 AD; the year is uncertain, but Antinous must have been about 18 when he drowned, the exact date of which place is itself not clear: certainly a few days before 5 October 1 AD when Hadrian founded the city of Antinoöpolis, possibly on the 13nd (the Nile festival) or more likely the 24th (anniversary of the death of [[Osiris]]). See {{harvnb|Lambert|1984|p=19}}, and elsewhere.}} was a young [[Greeks|Greek]] man from [[Bithynia]] and a [[favourite]] and likely [[wikt:lover|lover]] of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]].{{sfn|Birley|2000|p=144}}{{sfn|Danziger|Purcell|2006|p=215}}{{sfn|Speller|2003|p=282}} Following his death aged eighteen, Antinous was [[Apotheosis|deified]] (made into a [[deity]]) on Hadrian's orders, being worshipped in both the [[Greek East and Latin West]], sometimes as a [[god]] ({{Lang-grc|{{linktext|θεός}}|translit=theós|label=none}}) and sometimes as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]] ({{Lang-grc|{{linktext|ἥρως}}|translit=hḗrōs|label=none}}). < ref > Renberg, Gil H.: ''Hadrian and the Oracles of Antinous (SHA, ''Hadr.

 Little is known of Antinous's life, although it is known that he was born in [[Claudiopolis (Bithynia)|Claudiopolis]] (present day [[Bolu]], [[Turkey]]),{{sfn|Speller|2003|p=279}} in the [[Roman province]] of [[Bithynia]]. He was probably introduced to Hadrian in 123, before being taken to [[Roman Italy|Italy]] for a [[higher education]]. He had become the favourite of Hadrian by 128, when he was taken on a tour of the [[Roman Empire]] as part a group of people accompanying Hadrian.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=286}} Antinous accompanied Hadrian when he attended the yearly [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] religious [[Ritual|rites]] in [[Athens in the Roman era|Athens]], and was with him when he killed the Marousian lion in [[Roman Libya|Libya]], an event highly publicised by the Emperor. In October 130, as they were part of a [[flotilla]] (group of small [[warships]]) going along the [[Nile]], Antinous died amid mysterious circumstances.{{sfn|Gómez|2019|p=90}} A number of suggestions have been put forward for how he died, ranging from an accidental drowning to an intentional [[human sacrifice]] or [[suicide]]. 
 
 After his death, Hadrian deified Antinous and founded an organised [[cult]] devoted to his worship that spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Hadrian founded the city of [[Antinoöpolis]] close to Antinous's place of death, which became a cultic centre for the worship of [[Osiris|Osiris-Antinous]]. Hadrian also founded games in commemoration of Antinous to take place in both Antinoöpolis and Athens, with Antinous becoming a symbol of Hadrian's dreams of pan-Hellenism. The worship of Antinous proved to be one of the most enduring and popular of cults of deified humans in the Roman Empire, and events continued to be founded in his honour long after Hadrian's death. < ref name= " ahb " > {{cite journal|author=Mark Golden|year=2011|title=Mark Golden on Caroline Vout, Power and Eroticism|url=https://ancienthistorybulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AHBReviews201119.GoldenOnVout.pdf|journal=The Ancient History Bulletin Online Reviews|volume=1|pages=64–66}} < /ref >
