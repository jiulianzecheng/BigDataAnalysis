A '''blockade''' is a physical blockage of a [[Harbour|port]] or other place. Usually used of enemy [[ships]] surrounding a port. 
 
 By extension, a blockade is any effort to make sure that supplies, [[wikt:troop|troops]], information or aid do not reach an opposing force. Blockades are used in nearly all [[military]] [[campaign]]s and the tool of choice for economic [[warfare]] on an opposing [[nation]]. The [[International Criminal Court]] planned to include blockades against coasts and ports in its list of acts of war in 2009.
