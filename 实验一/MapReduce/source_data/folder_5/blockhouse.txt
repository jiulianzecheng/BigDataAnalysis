 In [[military science]], a '''blockhouse''' is a small [[fortification]]. It usually has one or more rooms with loopholes, allowing its defenders to fire [[rifle]]s or [[handgun]]s in various directions. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Stephen C. Spiteri|title=Illustrated Glossary of Terms used in Military Architecture|journal=ARX Supplement|page=637|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/illustrated-glossary-of-military-architecture-terms.html|date=2010|publisher=MilitaryArchitecture.com|access-date=2 May 2016}} < /ref >  It usually refers to an isolated fort in the form of a single building. It serves as a defensive strong point against any [[enemy]] that does not possess [[Trebuchet|siege equipment]] or, in modern times, [[artillery]]. A fortification intended to resist these weapons is more likely to qualify as a [[Fortification|fortress]] or a [[redoubt]].  
 
 In modern times, it may be a pillbox, a small underground [[bunker]]. However, a blockhouse may also refer to a room within a larger fortification, usually a [[artillery battery|battery]] or redoubt. The term  " [[wikt:blockhouse|blockhouse]] "  is of uncertain origin, perhaps related to [[Middle Dutch]] ''[[:nl:wikt:blokhus|blokhus]]'' and 18th-century French ''[[:fr:blocus|blocus]]'' (blockade). < ref > {{citation|title=blockhouse (n.), blockade (n.)|work=Online Etymology Dictionary}} < /ref >
