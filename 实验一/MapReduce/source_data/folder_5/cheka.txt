 The '''Cheka'''  < ref > '''ЧК''' - чрезвыча́йная коми́ссия ''chrezvychaynaya komissiya'', Emergency Commission. < /ref >  was the first  [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[state security]] organization. It was created on 20 December 1917, after a decree issued by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Its first leader was Polish [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]-turned-[[communist]] [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]. < ref name= " Stalinsleadership " > {{cite book| last = Laver| first = John|  title = The Impact of Stalin's Leadership in the USSR,1924-1941| url = https://archive.org/details/aqahistoryasimpa0000unse| year = 2008| publisher = Nelson Thornes| isbn = 978-0-7487-8267-3| page = [https://archive.org/details/aqahistoryasimpa0000unse/page/3 3] }} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had been created in the cities. Many thousands of dissidents, deserters, or other people were arrested, tortured or executed by Cheka groups. < ref name= " Linc " > [https://books.google.com/books?id=R6HAJIJhNp4C & dq=red+victory+cheka+torture+beatings & pg=PA383 pages 383-385]{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Lincoln (1999). < /ref >   After 1922, Cheka groups underwent many reorganizations, as did the [[NKVD]].   
 
 From its start, the Cheka was an important military and security arm of the [[Bolshevik]] communist government. In 1921 the [[troops]] of the Cheka numbered 200,000. These troops policed and ran the [[Gulag]] system;  " requisitioned "  food; [[torture]]d and [[execution|executed]] political opponents; put down rebellions and riots by workers or peasants, and [[mutiny|mutinies]] in the desertion-plagued [[Red Army]]. < ref name= " Black " > {{cite book| last1 = Courtois| first1 = Stephane| last2 = Kramer| first2 = Mark| title = Livre Noir Du Communisme: Crimes, Terreur, Repression| url = https://archive.org/details/blackbookofcommu0000unse| year = 1999| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-07608-2 }} < /ref > 
 
 Cheka was succeeded by [[OGPU]] in 1922, but its members were still called Chekists. < ref name= " lcweb2.loc.gov " > {{cite web|title=Library of Congress / Federal Research Division / Country Studies / Area Handbook Series/ Soviet Union / Glossary|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/soviet_union/su_glos.html#union|access-date=2011-07-27|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Name== 
 The full name of the Cheka in 1918 was (in Russian) the  " All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Profiteering and [[Corruption]] " . 
 
 A member of Cheka was called a  " chekist "  throughout the Soviet period, despite various official name changes. < ref name= " Solzhenitsyn cite " > {{cite book |title=The Gulag Archipelago |last=Solzhenitsyn |first=Alexander |author-link=Alexander Solzhenitsyn |year=1974 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-092103-3 |volume= II |pages= 537–38|quote=''An old Chekist''! Who has not heard these words, drawled with emphasis, as a mark of special esteem?
