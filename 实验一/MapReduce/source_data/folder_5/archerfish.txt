 '''Archerfish''' (also known as '''archer fish''', '''spinner fish''' or '''insect-eater''') are small perciform [[fish]]. Some live in [[fresh water]]. Others live in [[salt water]]. They live in lots of places, like [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Australia]], and [[Polynesia]]. 
 
 Archerfish eat [[insect]]s and other small [[animal]]s. The archerfish looks for an insect hanging over the water. The archerfish shoots drops of [[water]] out of its mouth at the insect. When the drops hit the insect, it falls into the water. Then the archerfish catches (gets) the insect and eats it. 
 
 Archerfish can eat insects up to two meters (six feet) away. Adult archerfish almost always hit the insect the first time, but young archerfish must do it many times in order to learn how. 
 
 The [[type species]] is the [[banded archerfish]], ''Toxotes jaculatrix''. It is also known as the '''[[Toxotes chatareus|common archerfish]]''' or just '''archerfish'''. There is the [[Toxotes chatareus|common archerfish]], which has a similar [[common name]] but is not the [[type species]]. The body of the ''Toxotus chatareus'' sooty but sometimes [[Silver (color)|silvery]] or [[gold]]. The dorsal side is greenish-brown.  
 
 The pectoral fins are clear or  " dusky "  in color. [[Pelvic fin|Pelvic fins]] may be darker and heavily pigmented.
