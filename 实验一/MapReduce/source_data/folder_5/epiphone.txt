 Epiphone is an American instrument company that started with an instrument making company founded in 1873 by Anastasios Stathopoulos in [[Smyrna, Ottoman Empire]]. The company moved to New York City in 1908. It was taken over by the owner's son, Epaminondas Stathopoulos. He named the company  " Epiphone "  by combining with his own name and the [[suffix]]  " -phone "  (which comes from the greek phon-, which means  " voice " ). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Epiphone {{!}} For Every Stage|url=https://www.epiphone.com/en-US/history|access-date=2023-11-06|website=www.epiphone.com}} < /ref >  It also started making guitars in the same year it was named, in 1928.
