 '''Ankylosaurs''' were herbivorous armoured dinosaurs in the order [[Ornithischia]]. Their armour was made of [[Scute|scutes]] (bony scales). They were quadrupeds with short and strong legs. Fossils of Ankylosaurs have been found on every continent. They were of two types: 
 
 * Ankylosauria 
 **[[Ankylosauridae]]: armoured from their head to their club-ended tail. 
 **[[Nodosauridae]]: no tail club but spikes and bony bumps on body. 
 
 They first appeared in the [[Middle Jurassic]], < ref > But see ''[[Yuxisaurus]]'' < /ref >  and lived until the end of the [[Cretaceous period]]. 
 
 == Size == 
 When adult, they were large: ''[[Edmontonia]]'' was bulky, broad and [[tank]]-like. Its length when adult was about 6.6 & nbsp;m (22 & nbsp;ft). < ref > ''Edmontonia'' in: Dodson, Peter  &  Britt, Brooks  &  Carpenter, Kenneth  &  Forster, Catherine A.  &  Gillette, David D.  &  Norell, Mark A.  &  Olshevsky, George  &  Parrish, J.

ISBN 0-7853-0443-6 < /ref >  Both main ''Edmontonia'' species, ''E. longiceps'' and ''E. rugosidens'' weighed about three tonnes. < ref name= " Paul2010 " > Paul G.S. 2010, ''The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs'', Princeton University Press p. 238 < /ref > 
 
 == Diet and feeding == 
 Ankylosaurs were low to the ground. The large [[hyoid]] bones left in skeletons shows they had long, flexible tongues. They also had a large, side [[secondary palate]]. This means that they could breathe while chewing.  
 
 Their huge gut suggests they [[fermentation|fermented]] their food, using [[symbiotic]] bacteria and [[gut flora]]. Their diet was mainly [[fern]]s and [[cycads]], which were hugely widespread, especially in the [[Lower Jurassic]]. The tropical climate supported plant growth, as it does today. Ankylosaurs fed on vegetation at or below the height of a meter. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Mallon|first=Jordan C|author2=David C Evans |author3=Michael J Ryan |author4=Jason S Anderson |title=Feeding height stratification among the herbivorous dinosaurs from the Dinosaur Park Formation (upper Campanian) of Alberta, Canada|journal=BMC Ecology|year=2013|volume=13|doi=10.1186/1472-6785-13-14|pages=14|pmid=23557203|pmc=3637170}} < /ref > 
 
 An unresolved question is whether they could feed higher than their usual mouth level, by raising the front of their body somewhat. This possibility which would give them access to many tree ferns and cycads which would otherwise be out of reach. Given the unevenness of terrain, there might be places they could stand on higher ground, and eat plants normally out of reach. 
 
 == The Ankylosaur  " message "  == 
 Ankylosaurs got some protection, not just from their armour, but from their being a miserable reward from the carnivore's point of view. They were signalling something like  " I'm going to be tough to kill and poor to eat " . 
 
 == Distribution == 
 Most ankylosaurs have been found in [[Laurasia]]. < ref > Note: Ankylosauria = formal name; ankylosaurs a general term. Comparison: Dinosauria vs dinosaurs. < /ref >  The first definitive ankylosaur to be recognized from [[Gondwana]] was discovered in [[Australia]] in 1964 and later named in 1980 as ''Minmi paravertebra''. Ankylosaurs would be expected to live in heavily wooded areas.
