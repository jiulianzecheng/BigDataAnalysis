 == History == 
 Before the occupation of Corsica by the [[Genoa|Genoese]], Cardo was a large city. Around the city were little villages where the fishermen of Cardo lived. This little port was called Porto Cardo, which means  " the port of Cardo. " 
 
 The Genoese felt the need to shelter the city from the sea storms and began to construct walls and buildings. In the time of governor [[Leonello Lomellini]], in 1380, they built a ''bastiglia'', also known as a [[citadel]]. With time, the ''bastiglia'' (Bastia) became more prosperous and important than Cardo. 
 
 Bastia was the capital of Corsica until 1791.
