 A '''whaler''' is a person who hunts [[whale]]s, or the [[boat]] they use. 
 They hunt whales for their oil, made from their [[fat]], called ''[[blubber]]'', and the [[meat]]. Today, there is a treaty which bans the hunt of some whale species. Most countries signed the treaty. A few countries still hunt whales for research purposes. Among those countries are [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Japan]].
