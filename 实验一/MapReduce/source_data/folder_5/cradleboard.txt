 When children are infants, they need to be carried around a lot.  [[Native American|Indigenous cultures]] in [[North America]] and throughout [[Lapland|northern Scandinavia]] have come up with a structure they called '''Cradleboard'''. Cradleboards are baby-carriers that protect the baby.  In Cheyenne, a cradleboard is called pâhoešestôtse or ☃☃, in Skolt Sami it is called ǩiõtkâmpâhoešestôtse or ǩiõtkâm. There are different styles of cradleboard; each culture has its own style or styles. Some communities still use cradleboards.

 Cradleboards are used for the first few months of an infant's life. At that time, babies are carried around a lot, and a portable baby-carrier is a great help.  Some cradleboards are woven, as with the [[Apache]]. Woven cradleboards are made of [[willow]], dogwood, tule, or cattail fibres. Wooden cradleboards are made by the [[Iroquois]] and [[Penobscot]]. [[Navajo people|Navajo]] cradleboards are made with a [[Pinus ponderosa|Ponderosa pine]] frame with buckskin laces looped through the frame. < ref name= " Kavasch14 " > {{Cite book|title=American Indian Healing Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/americanindianhe0000kava|last=Kavasch, E.

 Cradleboards are built with a broad, firm protective frame for the infant's [[spine]]. A footrest is located at the bottom of the cradleboard. A cradleboard also has a rounded cover over the infant's head that is similar to a canopy or a modern-day baby carriage hood. The purpose of this headpiece is to provide shade for the infant, since it could be covered with an animal skin, or a blanket in winter to protect against the elements in colder climates. The headpiece also provides extra head protection in case anything bumps against the cradleboard. Ornaments and sacred [[Amulet|amulets]] are often attached to the headpiece as well, for example  " beaded umbilical cord cases, and dream catchers or medicine wheels " , to amuse and help the infant develop his or her eyesight. < ref name= " Kavasch15 " > {{Cite book|title=American Indian Healing Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/americanindianhe0000kava|last=Kavasch, E.

 The inside of the cradleboard is padded with a lining of fresh plant fibres, such as [[Sphagnum|sphagnum moss]], [[Typha|cattail]] down, or shredded bark from [[juniper]] or cliffrose. The lining serves as a [[Diaper|disposable diaper]], although the Navajo could clean and reuse the lining made of shredded juniper or cliffrose bark. These plant fibres have [[antiseptic]] properties, they keep the infant's skin healthy. < ref name= " Kavasch15 " > {{Cite book|title=American Indian Healing Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/americanindianhe0000kava|last=Kavasch, E.

Before it is used, the moss is  smoked over a fire to kill [[insects]]; afterwards it is rubbed and pulled to soften it. In cold weather, the infant's feet may be wrapped in [[rabbit]] skin with the [[fur]] facing inward. The moss lining is surrounded by a [[birch bark]] tray insert placed into the cradleboard, which could be removed for cleaning. < ref name= " Densmore 1929 49 " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chippewacustoms0000dens|title=Chippewa Customs|last=Densmore|first=Frances|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society Press]]|year=1929|isbn=978-0-87351-142-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/chippewacustoms0000dens/page/49 49]|author-link=Frances Densmore|url-access=registration}} < /ref >

 Cradleboards have been used in cultures ranging from the sub-Arctic regions of present-day Canada, down to Mexico and Central America. In Arctic regions, cold weather does not make a cradleboard feasible for the infant's survival, and infants are carried in a sling worn under the mother's parka. < ref name= " Whiting, John Wesley Mayhew and Eleanor Hollenberg Chasdi 1994 114 " > {{Cite book|title=Culture and human development: the selected papers of John Whiting: Volume 6 of Publications of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|url=https://archive.org/details/culturehumandeve0000whit|last=Whiting, John Wesley Mayhew and Eleanor Hollenberg Chasdi|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-43515-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/culturehumandeve0000whit/page/114 114]}} < /ref >  Cradleboards were widely used by indigenous people across present-day North America.

Cradleboards were used in the southernmost part of the continent, in the [[Patagonia]] region. 
 
 Cradleboards were used during periods when the infant's mother had to travel or otherwise be mobile for work, and needed to protect the infant. The cradleboard could be carried on the mother's back, using support from  " tumplines " , or  " burden straps "  that would wrap around her forehead, chest or shoulders; if she carried a pack as well as the cradleboard, the pack strap would go around her chest and the cradleboard strap would go around her forehead. < ref name= " Densmore 1929 49 " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chippewacustoms0000dens|title=Chippewa Customs|last=Densmore|first=Frances|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society Press]]|year=1929|isbn=978-0-87351-142-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/chippewacustoms0000dens/page/49 49]|author-link=Frances Densmore|url-access=registration}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|title=American Indian Healing Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/americanindianhe0000kava|last=Kavasch, E.

They were also used when longer travel was required, as the cradleboard could be attached to a horse for transportation. 
 
 In the southwest United States and northern Mexico, among cultures such as the Hopi and Apache, infants would spend most of their day and night in the cradleboard. When they got older, infants were taken out of it more and more, for up to five times per day. When the infant reaches the age when it can sit up unsupported, it is then gradually weaned from the use of the cradleboard, and spends less time in it. At this time, the infant may use a second, larger cradleboard that replaces the first. By the time the infant is a year old and begins to walk, they are generally finished with cradleboard use. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Physiological and Medical Observations Among the Indians of Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico|last=Hrdlicka|first=Ales|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4179-3837-7|page=81}} < /ref > 
 
 Cradleboard use and its effect on mother-infant interaction has been studied in Navajo communities. It has been shown that cradleboard use has no significant negative effect on this development. In the first few months of infancy, cradleboards have a soothing effect on babies. After six months of age or more, infants begin to resist being placed in cradleboards more vigorously as they become more mobile, and they are often placed in the cradleboard with their arms and hands free, so that they can play with objects hung from the cradleboard for their amusement. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Navajo Infancy: An Ethological Study of Child Development|last=Chisholm, James S. and Cary Michael Carney|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2009|isbn=978-0-202-36251-9|page=187}} < /ref >

This can be avoided by placing padding between the baby's legs to keep the knees slightly bent with the hips angled outwards.  Some modern cradleboard users say that the small 1968 study of Navajo babies was intentionally designed to denigrate a traditional cultural practice.  < ref > {{Cite web|title=Reviving Tradition: One Cradleboard at a Time|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/reviving-tradition-one-cradleboard-time|access-date=2019-09-28|website=www.culturalsurvival.org|language=en}} < /ref >
