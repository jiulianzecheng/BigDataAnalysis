 Most icemakers are built into [[refrigerator]]s as part of their freezer compartment. You can either get ice by using a scoop inside the freezer or many modern refrigerators will have an ice and water dispenser on the front of it. The water used will come inside the back of it after which it goes through a [[water filter]] located somewhere inside of it.  
 ===Portable===

 A portable icemaker is an icemaker that is designed to easily move around and fit almost anywhere. These icemakers will plug into a standard household outlet and are manually filled with water whenever ice is required. Depending on how long the freeze cycle is will determine how thick the [[ice]] is. These icemakers are also known for making [[nugget ice]] that can easily be chewed.   < ref > {{cite web |title=How Does a Portable Ice Maker Work? |url=https://www.newair.com/blogs/learn/how-portable-ice-maker-works |website=NewAir |accessdate=30 May 2023 |language=en |date=28 December 2017}} < /ref >

These are permanently installed devices that require cleaning every so often.  < ref > {{cite web |title=How Icemakers Work |url=https://home.howstuffworks.com/icemaker.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=30 May 2023 |language=en-us |date=25 September 2001}} < /ref >  In order to keep the ice and the machine clean many will have advanced water filtration systems nearby to remove the [[calcium]] and other impurities in the water.  < ref > {{cite web |title=How Often Should You Clean Your Commercial Ice Machine? |url=https://www.cpsohio.com/blog/2015/12/21/how-often-should-you-clean-your-commercial-ice-machine/ |website=CPS Ohio |accessdate=30 May 2023 |date=21 December 2015 |archive-date=30 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530221140/https://www.cpsohio.com/blog/2015/12/21/how-often-should-you-clean-your-commercial-ice-machine/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
