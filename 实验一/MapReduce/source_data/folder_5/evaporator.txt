 An '''evaporator''' is a device used to turn a [[liquid]] into a [[gas]] through [[evaporation]]. 
 
 == Air conditioning and refrigeration == 
 [[Air conditioner]]s and [[refrigerator]]s use a compressed liquid with a low boiling point that vaporizes inside the system and cools it, while releasing the thermal energy into its surroundings. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Tomczyk |first1=John |title=Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology |last2=Silberstein |first2=Eugene |last3=Whitman |first3=Bill |last4=Johnson |first4=Bill |date=2016 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9781305856622 |edition=8 |pages=518â€“519}} < /ref > < ref name= " how to " > {{cite web|title=How Does an Air Conditioner Work?|url=http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/how_it_works/air_conditioner.html|access-date=27 April 2012|archive-date=20 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620202509/http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/how_it_works/air_conditioner.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The cooling liquid, or refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment (the evaporator coil) inside an air handler. Low pressure then causes the refrigerant to evaporate taking the heat with it. After this, it will continue back to the [[gas compressor|compressor]].
