 In the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]], the '''Jedi''' or  '''Jedi Knights''' are members of an old [[order]], who use a power they call [[The Force]]. 
 
 The Jedi use [[The Force]] which gives them psychic powers. Their typical weapon is the [[lightsaber]], a [[sword]]-like weapon with an energy blade. 
 
 The Jedi try to lead a good and virtuous life, serving others. They keep and defend the peace of the [[galaxy]]. 
 
 The opposite of the Jedi are the [[Sith]], who follow the Dark side of the Force (using the force for evil).
