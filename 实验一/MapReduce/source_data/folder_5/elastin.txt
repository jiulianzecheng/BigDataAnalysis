 '''Elastin''' is part of [[connective tissue]]. It is an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[protein]] which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps [[skin]] return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored.   
 
 Elastin is important in [[blood vessel]]s because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the [[aorta]].  Elastin is also very important in the [[lung]]s, [[ligament]]s, the [[skin]], the [[urinary bladder|bladder]], and [[elastic cartilage]]. It is present in all [[vertebrates]] above the [[jawless fish]]. < ref name= " pmid868643 " > {{cite journal | vauthors = Sage EH, Gray WR | title = Evolution of elastin structure | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 79 | pages = 291–312 | year = 1977 | pmid = 868643 | doi =  10.1007/978-1-4684-9093-0_27| isbn = 978-1-4684-9095-4 }} < /ref >
