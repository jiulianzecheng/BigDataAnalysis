'''Rutabaga''' or '''swede''' is a [[root vegetable]], a form of '''''Brassica napus'''''. Other names include Swedish turnip, neep and trump â€“ however, elsewhere the name  " turnip "  usually refers to the related white turnip. The species Brassica napus originated as a hybrid between the [[cabbage]] and the [[turnip]]. 
 
 Turnips are Brassica rapa and rutabagas are Brassica napobrassica. ... Rutabagas have a rough exterior that is normally coated in wax. The inside of a turnip is white, while '''the inside of a rutabaga is yellow'''. When cooked, turnips turn almost a translucent white, while rutabaga turns into more of a mustard yellow. 
 
 == History == 
 Rutabagas likely originated as a cross between turnips (Brassica rapa, variety rapa) and wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and are thought to have been '''first bred in Russia or Scandinavia in the late Middle Ages'''. ... The rutabaga is a cool-season crop and requires a long growing season owing to its slow growth.{{authority control}}
