 '''Temperament''' is a term from [[psychology]] to describe the way in which an [[individual]] behaves. Examples for temperament are [[introversion and extroversion]]. Many psychologists believe that the [[Trait theory|traits]] called temperament are [[innate]], and that they are not [[learning|learned]]. Temperament also seems to be independent of the mood of the [[person]] or [[animal]]. 
 
 [[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]] was among the first people to describe different temperaments, or [[humorism|humors]], as they were called at the time. Galen identified four types:  
 * Phlegmatic  
 * Choleric  
 * Sanguinic  
 * Melancholic  
 These correspond to the four [[classical elements]] fire, water, earth and air.{{stub}}
