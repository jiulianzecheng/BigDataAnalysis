 '''''Wattieza''''' is the earliest known [[tree]]. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Michelle Carr, Cosmos 2007. Wattieza is world's oldest tree |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1227 |access-date=2012-12-21 |archive-date=2007-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527214410/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1227 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Their [[fossils]] were found in [[New York State]]. 
 They stood 8 & nbsp;m (34 & nbsp;ft) or more tall, and looked like the modern [[Cyatheales|tree ferns]]. < ref name=Stein2007 > Stein W.E. ''et al'' 2007.

 They lived in the [[Devonian|mid-Devonian]], about 385 million years ago. They were [[cladoxylopsid]]s, close relatives of modern [[fern]]s and [[Equisetum|horsetails]]. 
 
 The crown of ''Wattieza'', discovered in 2005, was united with its [[root]] and [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]], known since 1870. The fossilized grove of  " Gilboa stumps "  had been described as ''Eospermatopteris'', though the complete [[plant]] remained unknown.
