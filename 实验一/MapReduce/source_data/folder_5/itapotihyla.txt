 '''''Itapotihyla''''' is a [[genus]] of [[frog]]s.  It is in the family [[Hylidae]]. It is [[monotypic]]. This means there is only one species in ''Itapotihyla'': '''''Itapotihyla langsdorffii'''''.  It is called the '''ocellated treefrog''' in English. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Anura/Hylidae/Hylinae/Itapotihyla |title=''Itapotihyla'' Faivovich, Haddad, Garcia, Frost, Campbell, and Wheeler, 2005 |author=Frost, Darrel R. |year=2014 |work=Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference.

 ==Frog== 
 ''Itapotihyla langsdorffii'' is large for a tree frog. The [[sexual dimorphism|male frogs and female frogs look different]]. The adult female frog is larger.  Most are {{convert|103|mm|abbr=on}} [[snout-vent length|from nose to rear end]] and the male frogs are {{convert|81|mm|abbr=on}} long. < ref name=Vrcibradic > {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00222930903015824| title = Sexual dimorphism, reproduction and diet of the casque-headed treefrog ''Itapotihyla langsdorffii'' (Hylidae: Lophiohylini)| journal = Journal of Natural History| volume = 43| issue = 35–36| pages = 2245–2256| year = 2009| last1 = Vrcibradic | first1 = D. | last2 = Teixeira | first2 = R.

 ==Eggs== 
 These frogs lay eggs in bodies of water in the [[rainforest]].  Sometimes they lay eggs in bodies of water that dry up.  Sometimes they lay eggs in bodies of water that are there all year. < ref name= " iucn status 17 November 2021 "  / >  This frog is an [[explosive breeder]].  That means it has many, many young at the same time.  The female frogs lay 6000 eggs at a time, on average. The males sing very loud for the females. < ref name=Vrcibradic/ >  Sometimes the male frogs grab and push and fight each other. < ref name=Vrcibradic/ >  This is strange for frogs.  In most frogs, the males fight each other in species where males are bigger than females. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Maffei, Fábio |author2=Ubaid, Flávio Kulaif |author3=Jim, Jorge |name-list-style=amp |year=2011 |title=''Itapotihyla langsdorffii'' (casque-headed treefrog): Male combat |journal=Herpetological Bulletin |volume=116 |pages=35–37 |url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/664105_1bd8eb9079c715e23a49cfef3d412f46.pdf}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Food and threats== 
 This frog eats [[arthropod|animals with bones on the outside]], for example grasshoppers and crickets.  It sometimes eats animals with spines, for example other frogs like ''[[Physalaemus crombiei]]'' and ''[[Scinax argyreornatus]]'', or even birds.  Scientists know because they found bones and feathers in the frogs' stomachs. < ref name=Vrcibradic/ >  Snakes, for example ''[[Chironius bicarinatus]]'', a [[Colubridae|colubrid]], eat this frog. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Bovo |first1=Rafael Parelli |last2=Sueiro |first2=Letícia Ruiz |year=2012 |title=Records of predation on ''Itapotihyla langsdorffii'' (Anura: Hylidae) by ''Chironius bicarinatus'' (Serpentes: Colubridae) with notes on foraging substrate |journal=Herpetology Notes |volume=5 |pages=291–292 |url=http://www.herpetologynotes.seh-herpetology.org/Volume5_PDFs/Bovo_Herpetology_Notes_Volume5_pages291-292.pdf |access-date=2022-09-25 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092300/http://www.herpetologynotes.seh-herpetology.org/Volume5_PDFs/Bovo_Herpetology_Notes_Volume5_pages291-292.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Home== 
 ''Itapotihyla langsdorffii'' [[arboreal|lives in trees]] in rainforests. It only lives in places that human beings have not changed. The ''Itapotihyla langsdorffii'' that live in Paraguay are dying because of [[habitat loss]] but the ones in Brazil are not.
