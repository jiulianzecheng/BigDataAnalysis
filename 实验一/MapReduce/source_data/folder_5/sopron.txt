 '''Sopron''' ( < small > Hungarian pronunciation: < /small >  [[Help:IPA/Hungarian|[ˈʃopron]]]; {{lang-de|Ödenburg}}, {{IPA-de|ˈøːdn̩ˌbʊʁk|-|De-Ödenburg.ogg}}; [[Central Bavarian]]: ''Ednburg'', {{lang-sl|Šopron}}) is a city of [[Hungary]], near the western border of Hungary with [[Austria]], at the foot of the [[Alps]], 60 & nbsp;km from [[Vienna]] (in Austria) and 220 & nbsp;km from [[Budapest]]. The people of this city are famous for their [[loyalty]] to their country, and their hometown. A famous monument is 'Gate of Faith' which is the [[symbol]] of the people's faith to Hungary in 1921.[[File:Sopron.Hauptplatz.jpg|thumb|300px|The main square of Sopron is the ancient Roman forum. It has Baroque buildings and the monument of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].]] 
 == History == 
 === Ancient Scarbantia === 
 At the time of the [[Roman Empire]], there was a city here called Scarbantia. The main square of Sopron is in the same place as the [[forum]] (or main square) of Roman times. 
 
 After this, the city was probably deserted. When the Hungarians arrived in the area, it was in ruins. In the 9th–11th centuries Hungarians strengthened the old Roman city walls and built a [[castle]]. The town got its Hungarian name of Sopron from a steward of the castle named Suprun. By 1153 it was an important town. 
 
 In 1273 King Otakar II of [[Bohemia]] took over the castle and took the children of Sopron's noble families as [[hostage]]. But the people of the city opened the gates when the [[army]] of King Ladislaus IV of Hungary arrived. The King Ladislaus made Sopron a free royal town. 
 
 === 1500s-1800s === 
 In 1528 Hungary was [[invasion|invaded]] by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] who destroyed many parts of the city but did not take it over. Many people from other towns fled to Sopron for safety. 
 
 In 1676 most of the ancient buildings in the city were destroyed by a fire. When they were replaced, they were in a new style, called [[Baroque]]. Many of the Baroque buildings are standing today. 
 
 === 1900s === 
 Sopron was an important town in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. After the [[World War I]] it became part of [[Austria]]. But the townspeople were not happy with this and in December 1921 they voted that the city should be part of Hungary. Since that day the city has been called  " Civitas Fidelissima " , ( " The Most Loyal Town "  which in Hungarian is  " A Leghűségesebb Város " ). A holiday is held every year to celebrate. 
 
 In [[World War II]] Sopron suffered badly. It was bombed several times. There were many Jewish people living in Sopron before the war. The [[Nazis]] and their Hungarian allies sent the [[Jews]] of Sopron to [[death camp]]s and killed nearly all of them, as well as other people who disagreed with Nazi ideas. 
 
 The Soviet [[Red Army]] captured the city on April 1, 1945. Sopron, as part of Hungary, was ruled by a [[Socialism|Socialist government]]. At this time many [[factory|factories]] were built around Sopron. The Socialist government took away a lot of the [[freedom]] that people had. In August 1989, in Sopron there was a big protest against the Socialist government, which was called the ''[[Pan-European Picnic]]''. While this was happening more than 200 people who lived in [[East Germany]] (which was Socialist) escaped to the West. This was the beginning of a big change for all the Socialist countries of Europe. People who had not been allowed to travel or live in other countries were finally allowed to be free. 
 
 === 21st century === 
 Hungary is now part of the [[European Union]]. Sopron now has trade with other countries, most importantly [[Austria]]. There are many German-speaking people who live in Sopron so most street signs are written in both Hungarian and German. 
 
 == Culture == 
 === Architecture === 
 
 The city of Sopron shows signs of its long [[history]] in its buildings. There are still walls and foundations from the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] times and also building from the [[Middle Ages]]. The medieval Kecske Church ( " Goat Church " ) was where [[coronation]]s (crowning kings) and [[parliament]] took place. There is also a very old Jewish [[synagogue]]. 
 
 Many old buildings whose [[architecture]] are from the 1600s and 1700s and are in the [[Baroque]] style which often has a lot of decoration. Stornó House is one of the most well-known buildings, because of its elegant Baroque architecture, its connection with King Matthias and its interesting collection. There is also a famous statue of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] from this time. the  " Várkerület "  is part of the city built where the ancient [[moat]] was; The inner row of houses follow the line of the castle wall. Várkerület has a famous Maria Statue. The [[Town Hall]] built in 1896 and the Ursuline Church is an important building in the [[Gothic Revival]] style. 
 
 === Countryside === 
 Sopron is popular as a [[holiday]] place because it is set in beautiful [[countryside]] where people like to walk in the hills, enjoying the pure air, the [[forest]]s and mountain [[spring]]s. There are many [[hiking]] paths and look-out towers. Near to Sopron is Lake Fertő. 
 The Löverek, is a beautiful hilly area south of the city, with forests of [[spruce]], [[oak]]s and [[chestnut]] trees. The flowers that bloom there include ''Lily of the Valley'' and cyclamens. 
 
 === Wine === 
 Sopron is a [[wine]] producing region, that is one of the few in Hungary to make both red and white wines. The [[grapes]] grown here include Kékfrankos for red wine and Traminer (Gewürztraminer) for white wine. In [[climate]] it is similar to the Burgenland wine region nearby in Austria, and several winemakers make wine in both countries. The group of ethnic German winegrowers in the Sopron area were the so-called [[Ponzichter]]. 
 
 === Sports === 
 MFC Sopron is a [[football]] team based in Sopron.
