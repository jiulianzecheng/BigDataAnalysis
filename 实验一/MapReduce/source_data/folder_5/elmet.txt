 '''Elmet''' ({{Lang-ang|Elfed}}) was an independent [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]] kingdom. It occupied the area of what was later the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. Elmet appears in records during the [[Early Middle Ages]] between the [[5th century]] and early [[7th century]]. Its [[:wikt:neighbor|neighbor]] to the east was the [[Anglian]] kingdom of [[Deira]]. The Anglian kingdom of [[Mercia]] was to the south. To the west it bordered on the [[Irish Sea]]. Elmet was the last surviving British kingdom in the early [[Anglo-Saxon]] period. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 Elmet emerged from [[Roman Britain]] as a British kingdom. The ''Elmetsæte'' (people of Elmet) were listed in [[Tribal Hidage]] as 600 [[Hide (unit)|hides]].{{efn|Elmet may have been larger. At the time the Tribal Hidage lists were made the lands of Elmet may have been divided between [[Northumbria]] and [[Mercia]]. The 600 hides may have been the Mercian portion. < ref name=Snyder209/ > }} < ref name=Snyder209 > Christopher A. Snyder, ''The Britons'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), p. 209 < /ref >  Elmet may have originally been a [[:en:wikt:subkingdom|subkingdom]] of the [[Brigantes]]. < ref name=Snyder209/ >  Ceredig, the last king of Elmet, was defeated in 617 by [[Edwin of Deira]] around [[Leeds]] in the south [[Pennines]]. < ref name=Ashley107 > Mike Ashley, ''The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens'' (New york: Carroll  &  Graf, 1999), p. 107 < /ref >  Edwin expelled Ceredig from Elmet and from that time on Elmet was a part of [[Northumbria]]. 
 
 The kings of Elmet had a royal residence at Campodonum (possibly near [[Doncaster]]) and another at Loidis (Leeds). < ref name=Bede132 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 132 < /ref >  The Elmetsæte were apparently [[Christian]], at least by the time they were conquered by Northumbria. [[Bede]] wrote of an [[:en:wikt:abbot|abbot]] named Thrydwulf and his [[monastery]] in Elmet wood. < ref name=Bede132/ >
