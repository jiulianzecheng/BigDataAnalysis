 '''Crypsis''' is a word in [[ecology]] which means  " hiding " . It refers to the ways animals avoid being seen, or otherwise detected. It also includes the situation when an animal ''is'' noticed, but is not recognised for what it is. It may be either a [[defence against predators]], or a device for [[predators]] to get near [[prey]]. 
 
 Methods include [[camouflage]], nocturnality (night-time activity), [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] [[lifestyle]], [[transparency]], and [[Batesian mimicry|mimicry]]. < ref name= " zuanon " > {{cite journal| last=Zuanon J.  &  I.

 *Hiding is the simplest case of crypsis. The animal moves to a place where it cannot be seen. 
 *[[Camouflage]] is the case where an animal ''can'' be seen by (for example) a [[predator]], but not recognised. 
 *[[Mimicry]] is the case when an animal can be seen, but seems like another animal or plant. [[Warning colouration]] is an example.
