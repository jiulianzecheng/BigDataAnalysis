 '''Fentanyl''' (sometimes spelled '''fentanil''') is a [[synthetic]] [[opioid]] that is used as a painkiller. It also acts as a [[sedative]]. It has a short duration of action and works rapidly. The two most common forms are patches that are put on the [[skin]], and an [[intravenous]] [[solution]]. [[Paul Janssen]] developed Fentanyl in 1960. It is about 120 times as potent as [[morphine]]; this means much less Fentanyl is needed to get the same effect.  
 
 The effects of the intravenous solution can be seen after three to five minutes. In about twelve hours, the concentration in the bloodstream will have halved.  
 
 Many deaths have resulted from its improper use. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-death-toll-fentanyl-climbs-to-9-20160401-story.html|title=Death toll rises to 9 in suspected fentanyl overdoses in Northern California|last1=Serna|first1=Joseph|last2=Karlamangla|first2=Soumya|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2016-04-01}} < /ref >  Fentanyl has a relatively wide [[therapeutic index]] (270) < ref name= " Springer " > {{cite book |title=New Anesthetic Agents, Devices, and Monitoring Techniques |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msYvkdGM6F0C & dq=fentanyl+%22therapeutic+index%22+-narrow+-carfentanil & pg=PA122 |accessdate=20 October 2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-247-2796-4 |author1=Stanley, Theodore Henry |author2=Petty, William Clayton |date=1983-03-31}} < /ref >  which makes it a very safe surgical [[anesthetic]] when monitored carefully. Because it is so potent, finding the right dose to use requires great care: Fentanyl comes as a highly diluted solution. There is also a powder, but its use is impractical without advanced scientific equipment: The effective dose needed and a lethal dose of fentanyl powder placed next to each other would be difficult or impossible to differentiate with the naked eye. 
 
 Non-medical use of fentanyl by people without opioid tolerance can be very dangerous and has resulted in many deaths. < ref name= " DEA2015 " > {{cite web |title=Fentanyl |date=March 2015 |publisher=U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/fentanyl.pdf |access-date=2 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611072817/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/fentanyl.pdf |archive-date=11 June 2016 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  Even people with opiate tolerance are at high risk of overdoses. Fentanyl is used as a [[illegal drugs|recreational drug]]. This has led to thousands of [[drug overdose|overdose]] deaths each year from 2000 to 2015. < ref name= " Globalnews.ca-1 " > {{cite news|date=August 11, 2015|title='It is a huge issue': 145 fentanyl-related deaths in Alberta so far in 2015|publisher=globalnews.ca|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2159388/it-is-a-huge-issue-145-fentanyl-related-deaths-in-alberta-so-far-in-2015/|accessdate=16 November 2015}} < /ref > < ref name= " Pew-vesta " > {{cite news|last1=Vestal|first1=Christine|date=1 April 2016|title=As Fentanyl Deaths Spike, States and CDC Respond|agency=Pew Charitable Trusts|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/04/01/as-fentanyl-deaths-spike-states-and-cdc-respond|accessdate=13 July 2016}} < /ref >  It is now ''the leading cause of death for young adults in the US''.

 Most of it comes from Mexico.  As it is so powerful the quantities are very small. All the fentanyl needed to supply the US for a year weighs about 5 tonnes. This makes it hard to stop. Very few people are needed to make it. [[Heroin]] is not used so much now because fentanyl is more profitable. It has not spread much outside North America. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Murray|first=Christine|date=2023-07-25|title=How fentanyl changed the game for Mexico’s drug cartels|work=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/5d030731-4625-4521-81e4-b492108a87d7|access-date=2023-07-25}} < /ref >
