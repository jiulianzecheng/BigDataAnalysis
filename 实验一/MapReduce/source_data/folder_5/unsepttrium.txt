 '''Unsepttrium''' ({{IPAc-en||ˌ|uː|n|s|ɛ|p|t|r|i|əm}}), also known as '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|dvi]]-[[francium]]'''{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} , eka-[[Ununennium]], or element 173, is a possible [[chemical element]] which has not been observed to occur naturally, nor has it yet been made. Due to instabilities, it is not known if this element is possible, as the instabilities may hint that the periodic table ends soon after the [[island of stability]] at [[unbihexium]]; < ref name= " EB " > {{cite web|author=Seaborg, G.

Its atomic number is 173 and its atomic symbol is Ust. 
 
 The name ''unsepttrium'' is a temporary [[IUPAC]] [[systematic element name]].

 Although [[Richard Feynman]] noted < ref > 
 {{cite web|last=Elert|first=G.|date=|title=Atomic Models|url=http://physics.info/atomic-models/|accessdate=2009-10-09|work=The Physics Hypertextbook}} < /ref >  that a simplistic interpretation of the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[Dirac equation]] runs into problems with electron orbitals at ''Z''  >  1/α = 137, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond [[untriseptium]], and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals breaks down at this point, a more thorough analysis calculates the limit to be ''Z'' ≈ 173, meaning that neutral atoms most likely cannot exist with atomic number greater than 173. < ref > See [[Extended periodic table]] and [[untriseptium]]. < /ref >   This makes unsepttrium theoretically the heaviest neutral element possible.
