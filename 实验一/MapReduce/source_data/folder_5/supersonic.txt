 The term '''supersonic''' is used to describe a speed that is over the [[speed of sound]] ([[Mach number|Mach]] 1).  At a normal temperature like 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 [[Celsius|Â°C]]), the speed needed for something to be traveling at a faster than sound speed is about 344 [[metre per second|m/s]], 1,129 ft/s, 770 [[Miles per hour|mph]] or 1,238 [[kilometre per hour|km/h]]. Speeds faster than 5 times the speed of sound are sometimes called [[hypersonic]]. Speeds where only some parts of the air around an object (like the propeller) reach supersonic speeds are called [[transonic]] (normally somewhere between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2). < ref >  A Dictionary of Aviation, David W.

 [[Whip]] < nowiki/ > s have operated supersonically for many centuries. [[Artillery]] became supersonic in the 19th century. 
 
 It can be very hard to reach supersonic speeds, because [[Drag (physics)|drag]] increases a lot near these speeds. This slows a plane, and for years made control difficult. These problems were called the  " sound barrier " . [[Jet engine]]s and other developments solved the problems in the middle 20th century.
