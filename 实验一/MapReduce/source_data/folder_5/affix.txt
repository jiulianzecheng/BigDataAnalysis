An '''affix''' is a piece added to a [[word]], or root, < ref > Root = the part of a word which does not change. < /ref >  which signals or changes its role in a [[sentence]]. It is part of [[grammar]]. < ref > McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language''. Oxford University Press. < /ref > < sup > p18 < /sup >  Affixes may occur in various positions in a word: 
 
 * '''[[Prefix]]''': before the word/root, for instance: '''anti'''-climax; '''re'''-write. 
 * '''[[Suffix]]''': after the word/root, for instance: clima'''ctic'''; walk'''ed'''. Most plurals. 
 * Infix: Inside the word/root. Rare in English, example: the '''m''' in recu'''m'''bent. 
 * Interfix: between words, to connect them: the reduced ''and'' in sun ''''n''' sand; editor-'''in'''-chief.
