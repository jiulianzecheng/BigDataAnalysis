 '''Hornblende''' is a complex series of [[silicate]] [[mineral]]s. < ref > http://www.mindat.org/min-8789.html Mindat < /ref > 
 
 Hornblende is not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name is used as a general or field term, to refer to a dark [[amphibole]]. 
 
 It is an isomorphous mixture of three [[molecule]]s; a [[calcium]]-[[iron]]-[[magnesium]] silicate, an [[aluminium]]-iron-magnesium silicate, and an iron-magnesium silicate. 
 
 Hornblende has a [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]] of 5–6, a [[specific gravity]] of 2.9–3.4 and is typically an opaque green, greenish-brown, brown or black color. It is most often confused with the minerals [[augite]] and [[biotite]] mica, both of which are black and can be found in [[granite]]. 
 
 ==Occurrence== 
 Hornblende is a common constituent of many [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s such as [[granite]], [[diorite]], [[gabbro]], [[basalt]], [[andesite]], [[gneiss]], and [[schist]]. It is the principal mineral of [[amphibolite]]s. 
 
 Very dark brown to black hornblendes that contain titanium may be called [[basalt]]ic hornblende, from the fact that they are usually a constituent of basalt and related rocks. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The word hornblende is derived from the [[German language|German]] ''horn'' and ''blenden'', to 'blind' or 'dazzle'. The term ''blende'' is often used to refer to a brilliant non-metallic [[lustre (mineralogy)|luster]], for example, [[zinc]]blende and [[pitchblende]], the [[ore]] of [[uranium]].
