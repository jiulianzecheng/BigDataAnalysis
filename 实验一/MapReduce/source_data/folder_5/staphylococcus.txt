 '''''Staphylococcus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[gram-positive]] [[bacteria]]. The name comes from the {{lang-el|σταφυλή}} (''staphylē'') which means  " bunch of grapes "  and κόκκος (''kókkos'') which means  " granule " . Under a [[microscope]] they appear round, because they are [[cocci]]. They form in [[grape]]-like clusters. 
 
 The ''Staphylococcus'' genus includes at least forty [[species]]. Of these, nine have two subspecies and one has three subspecies. Most are harmless and live normally on the skin and [[mucous membrane]]s of humans and other organisms. Found worldwide, they are a small component of soil microbial flora.
