 '''Passover''' ({{lang-he|פסח, '''Pesach'''}}) is a religious [[holiday]] or [[festival]] noted by ceremonies each year, mostly by [[Jewish]] people. They celebrate it to remember when [[God]] used [[Moses]] to free the [[Israelites]] from [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]], as told in the book of [[Exodus]] in the [[Bible]]. < ref > {{bibleref|Exodus|3–15|HE}} < /ref >  God told Moses to set aside this special week originally called  " the feast of [[Matzo|unleavened bread]] " . During this time, the people eat special foods, do special [[ritual]]s and sing songs. Passover is around the time of [[Easter]] (March/April) each year. 
 
 The [[Last Supper]] was probably a Passover Seder.  
   
 ==Second Passover== 
 The  " Second Passover "  (Pesach Sheni) on the 14th of Iyar in the Hebrew Calendar is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible < ref > {{bibleref|Numbers|9|HE}} < /ref >  as a make-up day for people who were unable to offer the [[Passover sacrifice]] at the appropriate time.
