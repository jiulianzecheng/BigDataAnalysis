 A {{Nihongo||神木|'''shinboku'''}}, which means  " god tree "  in English, is a tree or forest that is worshipped as a physical object of worship at or near a Shinto shrine. It is believed to be a repository in which spirits or {{Transl|ja|[[kami]]}} reside. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2016-08-22|title= " Shintai, Shinboku " : The Divine Object or Tree|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/views/b05210/|access-date=2023-03-11|website=nippon.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto詳細|url=https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9662|access-date=2023-03-11|website=國學院大學デジタルミュージアム|language=ja}} < /ref >  Shinboku are often wrapped in {{Transl|ja|[[shimenawa]]}}, which makes them distinctly visible. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Muza-chan's Gate to Japan|url=https://muza-chan.net/japan/index.php/blog/shinboku-sacred-tree|access-date=2023-03-11|website=muza-chan.net|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 The term  " goshingi "  refers to trees that are considered sacred or divine within the grounds of Shinto shrines and jingū of Shinto. This term also includes the surrounding forests, as well as trees that are not intended for logging. Goshingi also refers to trees that are owned by shrines or individuals and have a special significance in folklore. Additionally, it may refer to trees that have been deliberately cut down and used as timber for building shrines or left to grow naturally. < ref name= " Mertz " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3PjDQAAQBAJ|title=Wood and Traditional Woodworking in Japan|last=Mertz|first=Mechtild|date=2016|publisher=Kaiseisha Press|isbn=9784860993238|pages=85,120}} < /ref > 
 
 == Overview == 
 Nature worship, also called Himikura Shinto, is a component of the traditional Shinto religion that emerged in Japan. This form of worship is founded on appreciation, awe, and reverence for kami (spirits or deities), life, and the natural world. In ancient Shinto rituals, symbolic items such as trees were utilized as vessels for Shinto deities in areas where the environment underwent changes. 
 
 For many years, Shinto shrines and rituals have been shaped by foreign religions and evolved independently, resulting in a variety of Shinto forms. Japan now has tens of thousands of Shinto shrines, with many built on the grounds of ancient Shinto shrines. These shrines may include sacred trees, [[iwakura]], rock formations, steles, or mounds, representing Japan's history of nature worship. 
 
 Some shrines in Shinto worship a sacred tree instead of having a physical structure. In Shinto rituals, evergreen trees with pointed branches, known as tamagushi, are used as a substitute for the gods to descend from. The most popular type of tamagushi is the sakaki tree, but other species such as hisakaki and ogatama no ki are used in regions where sakaki does not grow naturally (areas north of the Kanto region). 
 
 In general, a  " tadakushi "  refers to a branch that has been cut down to be offered to the gods, while a  " sacred tree "  is a tree that is still rooted in the earth and worshipped by many people. 
 
 == {{Transl|ja|Yorishiro}} == 
 Kami-yorigi, also called kanjinboku, are objects that serve as a dwelling place for the gods and are given special treatment by being decorated with shimenawa. The Nageia nagi tree is one example of a yorishiro that is also adorned with shimenawa. Common types of yorishiro include the Nageia nagi tree, mochinoki tree, and cedar tree. 
 
 Some trees are also treated as sacred trees for their own sake, such as the cedar trees at [[Ise Grand Shrine]]. These trees are considered special and separate from the gods, and are preserved to maintain the shrine's natural scenery and solemn atmosphere. In addition, those who work in the mountains may temporarily enshrine a tree that stands out as a substitute for the god of the mountain. 
 
 The [[gohei]] is a special item used in Shinto ceremonies. It's made from sakaki and nagi, and is sometimes referred to as a sacred tree. However, it was originally created as a replacement for a real sacred tree in ancient Shinto practices. 
 
 == Divine realms and boundaries == 
 In old Shinto times, people believed that Shinto shrines were where the gods lived or where the present world and the everlasting world met. They were respected and feared. To make it difficult for bad things, gods, and people to enter and leave easily, shimenawa were hung as barriers, making it a forbidden area. Even now, there are many places such as Okinoshima Island where not only the shrine, sacred tree, or forest of the local guardian are prohibited, but the entire island is. Sometimes, for a specific time period, rituals and festivals are held to invite the gods and bring good fortune.
