 '''Polypropylene (PP)''', or '''polypropene''', is a type of plastic. It is a [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] which can be made into a [[fibre]] for yarn and fabric, film for packaging, or many other shapes.  
 
 As a plastic it can be made [[translucent]] but usually is [[opaque]] and often brightly colored. It is tough, and resists many [[solvent]]s, [[acid]]s and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]]. 
 
 It can be formed into a thin thread and woven into a strong strap, often used on backpacks, bags, and other things. 
 
 In 2008, the global market for polypropylene had a volume of 45.1 million [[metric ton]]s, which led to a turnover of about $65 billion (~ â‚¬47.4 billion). < ref > {{cite web|title = Market Study: Polypropylene|publisher = Ceresana Research|url = http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polypropylene/}} < /ref >
