 }} < /ref >  Ueshiba wanted to create an art where people could defend themselves without harming their attacker by using the attackers  " ki "  against them. He wanted each practitioner of aikido to develop both physically and spiritually. 
 
 Aikido is performed by blending with the way the attacker moves, using the force of the attack rather than coming against it. This is achieved by using the attackers  " ki "  against them. This takes very little physical strength, as the ''aikidōka'' (person who does aikido) uses the force of the attacker's own [[momentum]] using stepping and turning movements. The techniques are completed with many different [https://budodragon.com/what-is-taught-in-aikido-a-definitive-beginners-guide-to-learning-the-japanese-art/ throws] or [[joint locks]] which can be combined with different defenses. < ref name= " Aikido " > {{cite encyclopedia

 }} < /ref >  Aikido is one of many [[grappling]] arts. 
 
 Aikido is based on the martial art of [[Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]], but began to separate from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the [[Oomoto|Ōmoto-kyō]] religion. Ueshiba's early students' records use the name ''aiki-jūjutsu''. < ref name= " Pranin-Aikijujutsu " > {{cite encyclopedia

 }} < /ref >  Many of Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with different groups placing importance on different things. However, they all share techniques learned from Ueshiba and most have concern for the safety of the attacker.
