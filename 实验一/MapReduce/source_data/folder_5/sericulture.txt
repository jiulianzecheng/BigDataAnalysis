'''Sericulture''', also called '''silk farming''', is the process of making [[silk]] fibers. It starts by raising [[silkworm]]s and then processing the fibers they produce. Silk fibers are combined into silk [[thread]]. The thread can then be twisted into silk [[yarn]] or [[weaving|woven]] into silk [[cloth]] (fabric). 
 
 == Production == 
 
 ===Stages of production=== 
 The stages of production are as follows: 
 
 # The silk moth lays thousands of eggs. 
 # The silk moth eggs hatch to form larvae or caterpillars, known as silkworms. 
 # The larvae feed on [[mulberry]] leaves. 
 # Having grown and moulted several times, the silkworm pushes out silk fibers to make a net to hold itself. 
 # It swings its head from side to side in a figure '8' distributing the [[saliva]] that will form silk.  
 # The silk solidifies when it contacts the air. 
 # The silkworm spins approximately one mile of filament (fiber) and completely encloses itself in a cocoon. This takes about two or three days.  
 #The whole cocoons are picked and boiled, killing the silkworm pupa. 
 # The silk is obtained by brushing the undamaged cocoon to find the outside end of the filament. 
 # The silk filaments are then wound on a reel.  
 
 The amount of usable quality silk in each cocoon is small. As a result, about 2500 silkworms are required to produce a pound of raw silk. < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite web |website = TexereSilk.com |title = Silk Making: How to Make Silk |url = http://texeresilk.com/article/silk_making_how_to_make_silk |access-date = 25 May 2014 |archive-date = 26 May 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140526015447/http://texeresilk.com/article/silk_making_how_to_make_silk |url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 One cocoon contains approximately 1,000 yards (meters) of silk filament. The silk at the winding stage is known as  " raw "  silk. One thread is made up of as many as 48 individual silk filaments.
