 '''Populism''' is a name for a kind of [[Politics|political movement]]. Populists usually try to make a difference between common people and  " [[Elitism|elites]] "  (meaning usually, top classes of people) . Populists may think of wealthy people or well-educated people as belonging to the class of elites. Populists may also call those who have been working in government for a long time  " [[The Establishment|establishment]] "  and count them as elites too. A theme of populism is that the common people lack certain privileges that the elites have, or that commoners cannot do certain things the elites can do. The populists see themselves on the side of the common people. They want to help the common people get some of the rights and privileges of the elites.
