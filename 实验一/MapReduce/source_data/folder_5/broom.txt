 A '''broom''' is a [[cleaning]] [[tool]]. It consists of stiff fibres attached to, and roughly parallel to, a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[Handle (grip)|handle]], the '''broomstick'''.  In the context of [[witchcraft]],  " broomstick "  is likely to refer to the broom as a whole. A smaller whisk broom or [[brush]] is sometimes called a [[duster]]. 
 
 ==History of broom design== 
 [[Image:BambusaBrooms.jpg|left|thumb|Women using brooms made from [[bambusa]] (1899)]] 
 Brooms have changed very much in their construction, since they developed from ad-hoc use of branches and bundles of several natural fibres. Originally, all brooms were round, a shape that is easy to construct but inefficient for actually sweeping. Brooms could be attached to a handle, either short for a whisk broom, or long for a broom used to sweep the floor or fireplace. The word for the tool was originally ''besom'', ''[[Broom (shrub)|broom]]'' simply being the material of which it was normally made. The fibres used in modern brooms are from [[broom corn]]. They are long, straight, durable, and bound together  in the plant. The newest major change is the ''flat broom'', invented by the [[Shakers]] in the 1800s, which has far more width for pushing dirt and nearly all brooms produced today are flat brooms. 
 
 ==Brooms and witchcraft== 
 
 Brooms have long been connected with witchcraft, almost universally portrayed as medieval-style round brooms and associated with female [[witch]]es. Despite the association with women, in 1453, the first known case of claiming to have flown on a broomstick is recorded, confessed by the male witch Guillaume Edelin. < ref > Man, Myth and Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural. 1970, edited by Richard Cavendish. < /ref > 
 
 ===In Literature and Poetry=== 
 
 *In the Bible, Luke 15:8  " The Parable of the Lost Coin " , the broom is used as a symbol for women's work.   " Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one.  Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? " 
 
 *In many works of [[fiction]], broomsticks are pictured as a means of [[air transport]] for witches. A broom is usually flown with the brush behind the rider. 
 
 *The [[Harry Potter]] book series is distinctive in portraying magical [[broomsticks in Harry Potter|flying brooms]] as used equally by both sexes, and especially prominently by [[Quidditch]] players as analogues of polo ponies. 
 
 *Many toys and [[costume]] accessories have been made in the form of brooms.
