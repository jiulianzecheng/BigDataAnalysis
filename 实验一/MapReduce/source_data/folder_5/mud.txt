 Some [[animal]]s including [[worm]]s, [[frog]]s, [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[crayfish]] live in mud.  [[Pig]]s and [[elephant]]s use it to cool themselves in hot [[weather]].  Some people enjoy making [[mud pie]]s out of mud.  
 
 Great river systems like the [[River Amazon|Amazon]] bring down to the delta immense amounts of mud which ends up in the sea outside the fan of the river mouth. [[Mudrock]] is what the mud may become millions of years later. Mudrocks make up fifty percent of the [[sedimentary rocks]] in the geologic record, and are easily ''the most widespread deposits on Earth''. < ref > Boggs S. 2005.
