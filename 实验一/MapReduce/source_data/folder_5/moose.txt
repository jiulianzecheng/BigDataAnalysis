 A '''moose''' (''Alces alces''; called '''elk''' in [[Europe]]) is a large [[deer]]. Some authorities put the American moose in a different species, ''Alces americanus''. 
 
 A male moose is called a ''bull'', a female moose is called a ''cow'', and a young moose is called a ''calf''. A group of moose is called a ''herd''. The plural form of moose is  " moose”. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/moose|title=moose Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-15}} < /ref > 
 
 Moose live in northern [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and in [[North America]]. Moose usually live in areas with [[lake]]s, [[marsh]]es and [[swamp]]s. They also live in mountain ranges. 
 
 == Range == 
 Moose live in North America and also range from northern Europe to [[Siberia]]. In Europe they live in [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltic countries]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]). In North America they live in [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] and northern parts of the [[United States]]. In 2008 they were re-introduced to [[Scottish Highlands]] from Scandinavia. 
 
 === Population === 
 There are about 115,000 moose in Finland, and about the same number in Norway. [[Alaska]] has about 200,000. Canada and [[Russia]] each have between 500,000 and one million. There are also some in the [[continental United States]]. The animal is widely distributed. 
 
 == Life == 
 [[File:Elk in Jasper National Park.webm|thumb|Elk in Jasper National Park]] 
 Moose are active during the day. They live alone, but in [[winter]] they sometimes form small groups. Moose eat [[grass]], [[leaf|leaves]], twigs, willow, birch, maple shoots and water plants. After a [[pregnancy]] of 8 months, the female gives birth to one or two calves. Females can first become pregnant when they are between two and three years old. Young moose stay with their mother for a year; after one year they leave and live alone. Moose usually live to fifteen years old, but they can reach as old as twenty-seven years old. A mother moose will aggressively protect her young. Moose calves are hunted by bears and wolves. 
 
 == Predators ==

 A full-grown moose has few natural enemies.

 === Moose and humans === 
 Moose have been hunted by humans since the [[Stone Age]]. 
 
 Because of their dark coloured fur, moose are hard to see when they are crossing roads at night. They are sometimes hit by [[car]]s. In some countries like Canada, Finland and Sweden there are moose warning signs on roads and motorways are fenced.
