 '''Europe''' is the western part of the continent of [[Eurasia]], often thought of as its own [[continent]]. It is separated from Asia by the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] and the [[Bosporus]] [[strait]] in [[Turkey]]. 
 
 Europe is bordered by water on three sides. On the west is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. To the north is the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] separates [[Southeastern Europe]] from [[Africa]]. On the eastern border of Europe are the [[Ural River]] and [[Ural Mountains]]. 
 
 There are at least 44 or 48 countries in Europe (the European identities of 5 transcontinental countries: [[Republic of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] are disputed). Most of these countries are members of the [[European Union]]. 
 
 Europe covers about 10,180,000 [[square kilometre|square kilometers]] (3,930,000 [[square mile|square miles]]). This is 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of its land area). 
 
 As of 2017, about 510 million people lived in Europe. < ref > " [https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/ World Populations Prospects, the 2015 RevisionS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927210437/https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/ |date=2016-09-27 }} " .

 Europe is a major [[Tourism|tourist]] attraction. People come from all over the world to see its many [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Sites]] and other attractions. 
 
 == Origin of name == 
 Europe is named after a princess in [[Greek mythology]] called  " Europa. "  The [[Mythology|myth]] says that [[Zeus]] [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] Europa and took her to [[Crete]], where she became the mother of King [[Minos]] (from whom Europe’s first civilization gets its name, the [[Minoa|Minoans]]). 
 
 The name  " Europa "  was later used to describe [[Greece]]. Then, as the rest of modern-day Europe started to have cities and [[empire|empires]], the entire area West of the [[Ural Mountains]] came to be called  " Europa " .

 == Regions and countries == 
 Andreas M. Kaplan describes modern Europe as a continent where many different [[culture]]s live closely together,  " embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances " . < ref > {{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006|title=Andreas M.
