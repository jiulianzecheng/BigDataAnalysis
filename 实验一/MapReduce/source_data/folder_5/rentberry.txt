 == Functional == 
 Rentberry offers a decentralized platform for landlords and tenants, based on a transparent process for submitting and reviewing rental applications, online payments, a risk assessment system for potential tenants and homeowners, and more. Rent is paid through the website. To do this, Rentberry works with HelloSign, offering tenants and landlords to sign sign legally binding documents digitally on the platforms. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Alex Lubinsky, CEO of Rentberry|url=https://www.propertyinvestortoday.co.uk/60-second-interview/2017/4/alex-lubinsky-ceo-of-rentberry|access-date=2021-03-22|website=Property Investor Today|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2018-01-27|title=10 cryptocurrency startups to watch in 2018|url=https://techstartups.com/2018/01/27/10-cryptocurrency-startups-watch-2018/|access-date=2021-03-22|website=Tech News {{!}} Startups News|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Rentberry also uses the DataUSA.io API service and database, providing tenants with information about the area where the tenant is looking for housing, including population, average age, poverty rate, average income, average property value, and more. 
 
 On September 10, 2018, Rentberry launched mobile applications for tenants and landlords on both iOS and Android. < ref name= " GmbH " / > 
 
 == Critics == 
 The American press gave mixed reviews and called Rentberry  " eBay for rent " , claiming that the platform could only lead to a rise in the rental market. 
 
 Since the first launch, the controversial bidding tool (a tenant can set a preferred price for an apartment) has been discussed in [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[The Independent]], [[HuffPost|HuffingtonPost]], CBS SF BayArea, SFGate, Inman, Curbed and other media. < ref > {{Cite magazine|last=Kosoff|first=Maya|title=A Start-Up that Lets Renters Bid Against Each Other for Apartments Just Launched in America's Two Most Expensive Cities|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/rentberry-apartment-bidding-launches-in-new-york-san-francisco|access-date=2021-03-22|magazine=Vanity Fair|language=en-us}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|last=Mims|first=Christopher|date=2017-04-02|title=Want That Apartment?

 == Lawsuit == 
 In March 2018, [[Seattle]] City Council imposed a one-year moratorium on platforms where you can bargain for rent, as in Rentberry. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Rentberry v. City of Seattle|url=https://pacificlegal.org/case/rentberry-v-city-of-seattle/|access-date=2021-03-22|website=Pacific Legal Foundation|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 In March 2019, Rentberry lost the case in the US District Court. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Schofield|first=Kevin|date=2019-04-28|title=City Council moves to extend moratorium on rent-bidding platforms|url=https://sccinsight.com/2019/04/28/city-council-moves-to-extend-moratorium-on-rent-bidding-platforms/|access-date=2021-03-22|website=Seattle City Council Insight|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Reports say the Seattle City Council plans to extend the moratorium for another year. As of June 2019, Rentberry is agglomerating the lists (boards) of rental housing in Seattle, as the moratorium has not yet been extended. < ref > {{Cite news|date=2019-04-28|title=City Council moves to extend moratorium on rent-bidding platforms|language=en-US|work=Seattle City Council Insight|url=https://sccinsight.com/2019/04/28/city-council-moves-to-extend-moratorium-on-rent-bidding-platforms/|access-date=2021-03-22}} < /ref >
