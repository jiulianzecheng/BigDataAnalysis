 '''''Protoclepsydrops''''' was an early [[amniote]] from about 314 million years ago. Its remains were found at the [[Joggins Fossil Cliffs]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The dating of this site has been debated, with dates from 320 million years ago (mya)  to 305 mya being suggested. < ref name=B & D > Benton M.J. and Donoghue P.C.J. 2006.

[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/26.full.pdf+html] < /ref > < sup > p39 < /sup >  It is now settled as 314.5–313.4 mya +/- 1.1 million years. < ref name=B & D/ > < sup > p40 < /sup > 
 
 The [[Skeleton|skeletal]] remains of ''Protoclepsydrops'' suggest it may have been a [[synapsid]]. If so, it is the oldest synapsid known, though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary. < ref name=B & D/ >  ''Protoclepsydrops'' lived slightly earlier than ''[[Archaeothyris]]'', which was definitely a synapsid. Like ''Archaeothyris'', ''Protoclepsydrops'' had a body shape which resembled modern [[lizard]]s.
