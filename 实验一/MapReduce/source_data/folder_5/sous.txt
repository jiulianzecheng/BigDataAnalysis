The '''Sous region''' (also spelt Sus, Suss, Souss or Sousse) is a historical part of [[Morocco]], which is part of the administration of Souss-Massa and Guelmim-Oued Noun. The region is known for the [[Argania|argan]] tree (which has become a symbol of Souss) as well as for being the capital of the [[Shilha people|Shilha]] Berber ethnic group. It is a big commercial and tourist region of the Kingdom. Vegetable production, shared between very big farms and small producers, helps the economic development of the region. The Souss plain produces 40% of Moroccan [[citrus]] fruits, and 60% of the production of early vegetables. < ref name= " Brill " > {{cite book |last1=Lévi Provençal |first1=E. |title=Brill Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition |date=1913–1936 |isbn=978-9004082656 |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-1/al-sus-al-aksa-SIM_5549 |access-date=8 March 2022 |format=Web |chapter=al-Sūs al-Aḳṣā}} < /ref >  It was historically a big part of [[trans-Saharan trade]].
