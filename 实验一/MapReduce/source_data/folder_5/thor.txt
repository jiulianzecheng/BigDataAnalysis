 '''Thor''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Þórr'') is the god of [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] in [[Norse mythology]], associated with strength, storms, hallowing, sacred groves and tress and fertility. He is the son of [[Odin]] and [[Jörð]], the personification of the Earth, and is the strongest of the [[:en:Æsir|Æsir]].  
 
 The champion of [[Asgard]], Thor is said to protect both it and [[Midgard]] from the likes of the [[Jötnar|jǫtnar]], a race of beings native to [[Jotunheim|Jötunheimr]]. He is known in [[Old English]] as '''Þunor''' (''Thunor'') and in [[:en:Old_High_German|Old High German]] as '''Donar''' ([[Runes|runic]] ''þonar'' ᚦᛟᚾᚨᚱ), all of which stem from the  [[:en:Proto-Germanic_language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*Þunraz,'' meaning  " thunder " . 
 
 The modern English weekday [[Thursday]] (from [[Old English]] ''Þūnresdæg'', “Thunor’s [Thor’s] day”) bears the god's name. 
 
 ==Family== 
 Thor is the son of [[Odin]], chief of the Æsir, and [[Jörð]], the living [[personification]] of the Earth. He is the eldest of Odin's sons and is the half-brother of [[Baldur|Baldr]], [[Höðr]], [[Vidar|Víðarr]], and [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]]. 
 
 He is married to the golden-haired goddess [[Sif]], with whom he has a daughter, [[Thrud|Þrúðr]]. With his [[Jötnar|jötunn]] lover Járnsaxa, Thor has two sons, [[Móði and Magni]]. He has a stepson, [[Ullr]], who is Sif's son by a previous marriage. 
 
 ==Possessions== 
 According to writings known as [[saga]]s, Thor wielded a short-handled war hammer, [[Mjolnir]]. It was fashioned for him by the dwarven brothers [[:en:Eitri|Eitri]] and [[:en:Brokkr|Brokkr]], and is said to be the most powerful weapon in all the Nine Worlds, capable of crushing even mountains. When Thor threw the hammer, it magically returned to the god's hand. 
 
 Other attributes of Thor include a pair of gauntlets known as [[:en:Járngreipr|Járngreipr]], which he is required to wear in order to wield Mjölnir, a belt, [[Megingjörð]], which doubles his strength when he wears it, and a staff, [[Gríðarvölr]], which, along with Járngreipr, was given to him by the [[Jötnar|jötunn]] [[Gríðr]]. Thor was believed to travel in a chariot drawn by two goats named [[:en:Tanngrisnir_and_Tanngnjóstr|Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr]].
