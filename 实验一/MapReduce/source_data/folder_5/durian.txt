 A '''durian''' is a big [[fruit]] with a strong [[odor|smell]] and a hard shell with sharp [[Spine (botany)|thorns]]. Its flavour is loved by some people, especially in [[Southeast Asia]], where people name it  " King of Fruits " . Many hotels and [[public transportation]] systems do not let people carry durians because of the strong smell, which many people find unpleasant. 
 
 There are many different kinds of durian that are priced differently due to the people's preferences.  
 
 == Appearance == 
 The fruit can grow up to 30 [[centimetre|cm]] (12 [[inch|in]]) long and 15 & nbsp;cm (6 & nbsp;in) in diameter, and usually weighs one to three [[kilogram|kg]] (2 to 7 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]). 
 
 Durian is a [[tropical]] fruit. It grows only in humid, hot places. The flesh is used for many dishes in Southeast Asian [[cuisine]]s. The [[seed]]s can also be eaten when cooked.
