 A '''forward''' (or '''striker''') is a [[Association football|football]] player who is the closest to the other team's goal. The forwards are the players that are known to score the most goals. 
 
 Coaches usually send a forward that scores all the goals (''the centre forward'') and sends another forward that makes the assists (''second striker''). 
 
 The attackers are normally the last part of the formation numbers, for example: 
 
 * '''4-3-3''' is the formation. This formation shows that there are four [[Defender (football)|defenders]], three [[midfielder]]s and three '''attackers'''. 
 * '''4-4-2''' is the formation. This formation shows that there are four [[Defender (football)|defenders]], four [[midfielder]]s and two '''attackers'''. 
 * '''3-4-3''' is the formation. This formation shows that there are three [[Defender (football)|defenders]], four [[midfielder]]s and three '''attackers'''.
