 '''Teleostomi''' is a grouping of fish in the [[Gnathostomata]] ('jawed fish'). It contains the [[Extinction|extinct]] [[Acanthodii]] ('spiny sharks'), and the [[Osteichthyes]] ('bony fish'). Teleostomi have two adaptations which relate to their [[respiration]]: First, they had some kind of [[operculum]] (a set of [[Bone|bones]] which cover the [[Gill|gills]]). The also developed a primitive [[lung]]. As of 2020, there is no agreement, as to the level of the grouping. Some people see it as a [[clade]], others say it is a [[crown group]].
