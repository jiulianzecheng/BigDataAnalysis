The term  " '''Yankee''' "  (sometimes shortened to  " '''Yank''' " ) have many different meanings. All refer to people from the [[United States]]. Outside the United States,  " Yank "  is used to refer to any American, including Southerners. Within the [[Southern United States]],  " Yankee "  is a name which refers to all Northerners, or specifically to those from the region of [[New England]], often in a mean way. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' says that it is  " a [[nickname]] for a person from New England, or, more widely, of the northern States generally. "  During the [[American Civil War]], it was  " used by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]]s to the soldiers of the Federal army " . 
 
 Elsewhere in the United States, it often refers to people from the Northeastern states, but especially those with [[New England]] cultural ties. This would include people who have [[colonial New England]] settler [[ancestor]]s, wherever they live. < ref name= " ruth " > {{cite journal|year=1963|title=Swamp Yankee|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_american-speech_1963-05_38_2/page/121|journal=American Speech|volume=38|issue=2|pages=121â€“123|doi=10.2307/453288|jstor=453288|author=Ruth Schell}} < /ref >
