 '''Chiemsee''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkiːmzeː}}) is a natural freshwater lake in [[Bavaria]], < ref name=EB1911 > {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chiemsee|volume=6|page=132}} < /ref >  [[Germany]], near [[Rosenheim]]. It is often called  " the Bavarian Sea " . 
 
 The rivers [[Großache]] and [[Prien (river)|Prien]] flow into the lake from the south, and the river [[Alz]] flows out towards the north. The Alz flows into the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] which then merges with the [[Danube]]. The Chiemsee is divided into the bigger, north section, in the northeast, called ''Weitsee'', and the ''Inselsee'', in the southwest. 
 
 The [[Chiemgau]], the region surrounding the Chiemsee, is a famous recreation area.
