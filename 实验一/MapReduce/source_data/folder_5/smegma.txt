 '''Smegma''' is a substance that forms in the [[sex organ]]s of [[mammal]]s. It is made of [[epithelium|epithelial cells]], [[skin]] cells, and [[moisture]]. It is found around the [[foreskin]] of the [[penis]] in males, or in the folds of skin around the [[vulva]] in females. In males, the smegma acts like a [[lubricant]] which makes [[sexual intercourse]] easier. < ref name=wright > {{cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/wright1/ |title=How Smegma Serves the Penis |first=J. |last=Wright |work=cirp.org |year=1970 |accessdate=23 December 2014 |archive-date=10 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510025934/http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/wright1/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It can be white through to yellow in colour. < ref name=wright/ >  Smegma does not cause any harm, and normal washing will keep it under control; in fact too much washing may cause other problems. < ref > {{cite journal |title=Clinical features and management of recurrent balanitis; association with atopy and genital washing |first=H. |last=Birley |journal=PDF.js |year=1993 |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=400â€“403 |doi=10.1136/sti.69.5.400 |pmid=8244363 |pmc=1195128 }} < /ref >
