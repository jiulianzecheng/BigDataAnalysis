 '''XFL, LLC''', operated as '''XFL''', was a professional [[American football]]. The league was founded by [[Vince McMahon]], owner of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). The league was founded in 2000. The XFL was supposed to be a major professional sports league complement to the off-season of the [[NFL]], but could not find an audience and folded after its first season. The first and only champions were the Los Angeles Xtreme. Both the WWF and [[NBC]] each lost a reported $35 million. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=105329|accessdate=2014-09-18|title=XFL Is Down for the Count|publisher=[[ABC News]]}} < /ref >
