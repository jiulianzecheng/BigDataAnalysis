A '''paralegal''' is the professional of legal science that performs as part of a legal assistance system. Paralegals know the [[law]], and they use their knowledge to help people who are charged with a crime, people who want to charge someone with a crime, people who want to [[Lawsuit|sue]] someone, and people who are being sued. Paralegals are similar to lawyers, but not as educated in the law. They sometimes only do what lawyers ask them to do, but can sometimes work alone. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Legal/Paralegals-and-legal-assistants.htm |title=Paralegals - Occulational Outlook Handbook |accessdate=2013-03-18}} < /ref > 
 
 Some companies hire paralegals instead of lawyers, because they are less expensive to hire. Paralegals go to [[school]] for a shorter amount of time than lawyers do, and they do not make as much [[money]]. 
 
 == Education == 
 
 Most paralegals go to school for two to four years. They learn about different kinds of law, such as [[business]] law, [[criminal]] law, and [[civil law]]. They also learn how to work with lawyers, how to create [[contract]]s and other official agreements, and how to do [[research]] well. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.paralegalcertificates.org/training/ |title=Paralegal Training - paralegalcertificates.org |accessdate=2013-03-18 |archive-date=2013-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523035904/http://www.paralegalcertificates.org/training/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
