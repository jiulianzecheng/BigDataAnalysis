 '''Addiscombe''' is an area in [[Croydon]], in the [[London Borough of Croydon]], [[England]]. Three hundred years ago, Addiscombe was a rural area. The area was mainly used for farming and brick-making. There used to be a railway that went through Addiscombe, but in [[2000]], it was changed to tramlink tracks and a new stop was built.
