[[Adjective]]s and [[Adverb]]s can be '''comparative''' in [[English language|English]] and some other [[language]]s. When people are talking about two or more [[noun]]s, they can compare them (say the differences between them). The word which explains how they compare is called the '''comparative'''. They can also compare [[action]]s using [[adverb]]s. 
 
 Examples: (The comparative is in '''bold'''). 
 * John is tall, but Mark is '''taller''' 
 * An hour is '''longer''' than a minute. 
 
 Many words can be made into a comparative by adding ''er'' to the end of the word.  
 *cool - cooler 
 *big - bigger 
 *wet - wetter 
 *dark - darker 
 
 Words that end with the letter 'Y' can still be made into a comparative, but people change the 'Y' to an 'I' and then add 'ER'. 
 *happy - happier 
 *fluffy - fluffier 
 *angry - angrier 
 *costly - costlier 
 
 Some words cannot be made into a comparative by adding 'ER' Instead we use the word '''more''' in front. Most of these words have three or more [[syllable]]s, such as ''beautiful'', ''reliable''.  
 
 If people are not sure about a word, it is always acceptable to say  " more "  (something), such as  " more beautiful " ,  " more expensive " . 
 
 Warning:  The 'ER' ending and the word  " more "  together cannot be used.  
 *I am happier than you. - Correct. 
 * I am more happy than you. - Correct. 
 * I am more happier - WRONG. (Double comparative)
