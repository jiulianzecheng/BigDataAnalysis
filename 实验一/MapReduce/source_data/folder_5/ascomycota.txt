 '''Ascomycota''' is a [[phylum]] of [[fungi]] ([[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] Fungi) which can live in practically every environment, from freshwater habitats to deserts and forests. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Makar|first1=A.

 Members are commonly known as the '''sac fungi,''' due to the phylum having an ascus which is a sac like structure. Within this structure there are eight ascospores which are the sexual organ for ascomycetes. The ascospores get released by the ascus under humid conditions into the air where they can land on objects and spread the fungi. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=R.

 It was used in [[genetics]] because it contains the results of [[crossing-over]] between [[chromosomes]]. 
 
 There are currently three accepted classes in Ascomycota which are [[Saccharomycotina]], [[Taphrinomycotina]], and [[Pezizomycotina]]. Saccharomycotina mostly contains species which are single-celled ([[Unicellular organism|unicellular]]) like baker’s yeast (the yeasts that are commonly used in baking and result in the product rising) and Candida (the yeasts which cause the most fungal infections in the world). The species in Saccharomycotina reproduce by [[budding]] which is when an organism reproduces by forming a ‘bud’, this bud develops into a full organism. Taphrinomycotina are plant parasites that can has both a unicellular state and a filamentous (long, thread like structure) state when infecting plants. In their structure they do have an ascus but not ascomata. The largest subphylum in Ascomycetes is Pezizomycotina which contains all the species with fruiting bodies (except for [[Neolecta]]). Some examples members of the subphylum are cup fungi and truffles. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  These fungi reproduce by [[binary fission]] which is when the bacterium divides into two (or more) and each part regenerates to become a new cell which resembles the original cell. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Wiesmann|first1=U.

 Ascomycetes are extremely useful to humans as the have multiple uses in different fields such as [[fermentation]] with bread, alcohol and cheese and producing compounds which can be used in antibiotics and other medicine. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  An example is the [[genus]] [[Penicillium|Pennicillium]]. Some species of the genus can produce [[penicillin]] which can stop the growth or kill certain bacteria when it is used in antibiotics. But also, there are other species of Penicillium are import in producing certain types of cheese. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Hendrickson|first1=W. A.|last2=Ward|first2=K.

Members are known to cause skin infections in humans, Dutch elm disease in trees and rice blast in oryza. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
