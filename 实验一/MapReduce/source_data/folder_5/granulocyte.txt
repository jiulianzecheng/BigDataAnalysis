 '''Granulocytes''' are a category of [[white blood cell]]s which have [[Granule (cell biology)|granule]]s in their [[cytoplasm]]. < ref > Hoffbrand A.V. Pettit J.E. and Moss P.A.H. 2005. ''Essential haematology'' 4th ed, Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-632-05153-1}} < /ref >  They are also called '''polymorphonuclear leukocytes''' because of the shape of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], which has three segments. The term ''polymorphonuclear leukocyte'' often refers just to [[neutrophil]]s, the most abundant of the granulocytes. 
 
 Granulocytes are released from the [[bone marrow]]. They operate by [[phagocytosis]] and other means. < ref > Ernst J.D. and Stendahl O. (eds) 2006.

 ==Types of granulocytes== 
 There are three types of granulocytes, distinguished by their appearance under Wright's stain: 
 * [[Neutrophil]] granulocytes 
 * [[Eosinophil]] granulocytes 
 * [[Basophil]] granulocytes 
 
 Their names are derived from their [[stain]]ing characteristics; for example, the most abundant granulocyte is the [[neutrophil granulocyte]], which has neutrally-staining [[cytoplasm]]ic granules. 
 
 Other white blood cells which are not granulocytes are mainly [[lymphocyte]]s and [[monocyte]]s.
