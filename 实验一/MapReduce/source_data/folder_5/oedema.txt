 '''Oedema''' (U.S. '''edema''') < ref > Note on spelling and pronunciation: The origin of the term is [[Greek language|Greek]]. The '''O''' is silent, and it is pronounced as a long E (Ē). < /ref >  is '''dropsy'''. It was usually called ''dropsy'' until about the middle of the 20th century.  
 
 It is a [[medical condition]], and a sign or [[symptom]]. It is [[Inflammation|swelling]] caused when [[fluid]] leaks out of the body's [[capillaries]] into the [[tissue]]s. The fluid builds up and gets trapped in the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] around the leaking blood vessels. < ref name= " Edema " > {{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/edema/basics/definition/con-20033037 |title=Edema |date=2014-09-19 |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2015-01-03}} < /ref >   This causes swelling.  If there is enough swelling, oedema can be seen from outside of the [[skin]]. 
 
 Oedema can happen in any part of the body.  However, it is easiest to see in the arms and legs, including the hands, ankles, and feet. < ref name= " Edema " / >   Oedema in the arms and legs is called ''peripheral oedema''. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003104.htm |title=Foot, leg, and ankle swelling |last=Dugdale |first=David |date=2013-04-21 |website=Medline Plus |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2015-01-03}} < /ref >

 ==Signs and symptoms== 
 Some of the signs and [[symptom]]s of oedema are: < ref name= " Edema " / > 
 * Swelling or puffiness right under the skin 
 * Skin that looks stretched or shiny 
 * Changes in skin color 
 * Aching arms and legs 
 * Stiff [[joint]]s 
 * Weight gain or weight loss 
 * [[Blood pressure]] and [[pulse|pulse rate]] that are higher than normal 
 
 Oedema in the lungs (pulmonary edema) can make it [[dyspnea|hard to breathe]] or cause [[chest]] pain. < ref name= " Ware " / > 
 
 ==Causes== 
 Many things can cause oedema.  When oedema is mild (not very serious), the most common causes are: < ref name= " Edema " / > < ref name= " familydoctor.org " > {{cite web |url=http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/edema.printerview.all.html |title=Edema |date=2014-02-01 |publisher=American Academy of Family Physicians |accessdate=2015-01-03 |archive-date=2015-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309023501/http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/edema.printerview.all.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 * Eating too much [[salt]] 
 * Staying still for long periods of time 
 * [[Pregnancy]] 
 * [[Side effect]]s from some [[medication]] 
 
 However, oedema can also be a sign of serious [[disease]]. < ref name= " Edema " / > < ref name= " familydoctor.org " / >   Diseases that can cause edema include: 
 * ''Congestive [[heart failure]] (CHF).''  In CHF, the heart does not pump hard enough to send blood throughout the body.  This can cause blood to back up in the arms and legs (causing peripheral oedema).  It can also cause fluid to back up in the lungs (pulmonary oedema). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartFailure/Heart-Failure_UCM_002019_SubHomePage.jsp |title=About Heart Failure |date=2012-08-20 |publisher=American Heart Association |accessdate=2015-01-03}} < /ref > 
 * ''Liver damage (cirrhosis).''  Liver damage can cause fluid to back up in the abdomen (ascites) and the legs. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/cirrhosis/DS00373/DSECTION=all & METHOD=print |title=Cirrhosis |date=2014-08-16 |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2015-01-03}} < /ref > 
 * ''[[Kidney]]'' < span > '' problems.''  The kidneys' job is to remove extra fluid from the blood.  If the kidneys are not doing this job, the fluid builds up in other parts of the body. < /span > < ref name= " familydoctor.org " / > 
 * ''Deep vein [[thrombosis]] (DVT).  ''A DVT is a blood clot inside one of the deep veins in the body, usually deep inside the legs.  Oedema in the legs is one sign of DVT. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/dvt/facts.html |title=Deep Vein Thrombosis |date=2014-12-10 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2015-01-03}} < /ref > 
 * ''[[Varicose veins]]''.'' < ref name= " Edema " / > 
 
 == Treatment == 
 If oedema is not very serious, it often goes away on its own.  If a person has mild oedema in an arm or leg, they can often make oedema go away quicker by keeping the arm or leg raised above the level of the heart. < ref name= " Edema " / > 
 
 If oedema is more serious, it is treated with medicines called [[diuretic]]s.  These are medicines which help the body get rid of extra fluid by [[urination|urinating]] it out. < ref name= " familydoctor.org " / > 
 
 If oedema is caused by a disease, that disease needs to be treated. < ref name= " Edema " / >
