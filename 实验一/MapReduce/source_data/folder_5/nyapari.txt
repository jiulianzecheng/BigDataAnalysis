 '''Nyapaṟi''' is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] community in the [[Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara|Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands]] in [[South Australia]]. It is about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} south of the [[Northern Territory]] border at the base of the [[Mann Ranges]]. The nearby community of [[Kaṉpi, South Australia|Kaṉpi]] is {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} to the west. 
 
 There are about 85 people living there. The residents are mostly [[Pitjantjatjara]] people. Nyapaṟi began as a family [[Outstation movement|outstation]] by the Stevens family, who moved here to look after the country of their [[ancestor]]s. Today it is a fully-established community of extended families. < ref > {{cite web|title=Nyapari|url=http://www.anangu.com.au/sa-communities/nyapari.html|work=APY Communities|publisher=Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara|accessdate=28 October 2012|archive-date=3 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103080646/http://www.anangu.com.au/sa-communities/nyapari.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It serves as an administration centre for nearby outstations Ulkiya and Tankannu. 
 
 Because both Nyapaṟi and nearby Kaṉpi are small communities, there are only basic services and most of them are shared between the two towns. In Nyapaṟi, there is an art centre and a health [[clinic]]. Supplies are delivered once every two weeks, and mail is delivered once per week. The community store is in Kaṉpi. < ref > {{cite web|title=Nyapari|url=http://www.waru.org/communities/nyapari/|work=Waru|publisher=PY Media|accessdate=28 October 2012|archive-date=14 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014075926/http://waru.org/communities/nyapari/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Both Kaṉpi and Nyapaṟi had their own schools from 1987, but these joined together in 1993. The new school, Murputja Education Centre, was built between the two communities, {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} east of Nyapaṟi and 9 & nbsp;km west of Kaṉpi. < ref > {{cite web|title=Murputja School|url=http://www.waru.org/communities/murputja/|work=Waru|publisher=PY Media|accessdate=28 October 2012|archive-date=14 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014075916/http://waru.org/communities/murputja/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
