During other seasons, the event instead occurs between World Cupe events. This depends on if the FIS World Cup starts by late October, or if it begins by mid-late November. 
 
 In Sweden, the event is generally considered the first major competition of the season. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://affarer.cc/start/1.237135-hogbo-gif-fick-bra-start-pa-sasongen|title=Högbo GIF fick bra start på säsongen|publisher=Arbetarbladet|language=sv|date=16 November 2008|access-date=16 October 2011|archive-date=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225211528/http://affarer.cc/start/1.237135-hogbo-gif-fick-bra-start-pa-sasongen|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
