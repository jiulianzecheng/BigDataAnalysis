 '''''Quarxs''''' was one of the first computer animated series, predating ''ReBoot'', and the first one produced in HD. It was created by Maurice Benayoun and Belgian comic-book artist François Schuiten. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2009/Volume-32-Issue-4-Apr-2009-/Without-Bounds.aspx|title = Without Bounds  & #124; Computer Graphics World}} < /ref >  It was shown between 1990 and 1993. 
 
 Each episode is three minutes long. 100 were planned, but only 12 were made. A cryptobiology researcher, who discovered Quarxs, describes them as mysterious, omnipresent and invisible creatures that bend the laws of physics, biology and optics, and the only reason the world is not perfect. 
 
 ''Quarxs'' is the only fictional series by Maurice Benayoun, a contemporary artist who later moved to media art. It has received many awards from international events and festivals, such as SIGGRAPH, Imagina, Ars Electronica, ISEA, Images du Futur, Sitges, Tampere, and the International Monitor Award. The series has been shown in more than 15 countries.
