 A '''gland''' is a group of [[cell]]s in the body which make substances such as [[hormones]]. They are in [[human]]s and other animals, and in [[plant]]s.  
 *If the substance is put directly into the [[blood]]stream, the gland is called '''[[endocrine gland]]'''.  
 *If the substance is carried by a [[duct]], the gland is called an '''[[exocrine gland]]'''. Exocrine  ducts empty outside the body, or into [[cavity|cavities]] inside the body. 
 
 Examples of glands in humans are: 
 *[[Sweat gland]]s that produce [[sweat]] for perspiration. 
 *The [[pineal gland]] in the [[brain]], which produces the hormone [[melatonin]] at night.
