 '''Placodonts''' were a group of [[Triassic]] [[Ocean|marine]] [[reptiles]] which had heavy flat teeth. These teeth were used for crushing [[shellfish]]. < ref name=reign > Benton M.J. 1990. ''The reign of the reptiles''. Crescent, New York. 118 & ndash;122 < /ref >  Placodonts are in the [[Order (biology)|Order]] [[Sauropterygia]], the group that includes [[Plesiosaur]]s. Placodonts were mostly between {{convert|1|to|2|m|ft|0}} in length, up to a maximum {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} long. They are found in marine [[sediment]]s of the [[Middle Triassic|Middle]] and [[Upper Triassic]], 235 & ndash;250 million years ago. < ref name=reign/ > < ref > Benton M.J. 2015. ''Vertebrate palaeontology'', 4th ed p150, 152/3. < /ref > 
 
 The first specimen was discovered in 1830, and the group was very widely distributed. Shellfish were common throughout the [[Mesozoic]] period, but this group of shellfish-eaters went extinct at the end of the Triassic. They were clearly a victim of some event which disturbed their lifestyle. The end-Triassic had several [[extinction event]]s which are not well understood. 
 
 ==Palaeobiology== 
 The earliest forms like '''''Placodus''''', in the early to middle [[Triassic]], looked rather barrel-shaped. Later placodonts had bony plates on their backs which protected their bodies while they were feeding. 
 
 By the [[Upper Triassic]], these plates had grown so that some placodonts of the time looked like the [[sea turtle]]s of modern day.  Other placodonts developed plates that resembled the shells of [[horseshoe crab]]s and [[trilobite]]s rather than those of sea turtles. These adaptations are examples of [[convergent evolution]].  
 
 Because of their dense bone and heavy armour plating, these creatures would have been too heavy to float in the ocean. They would have used a lot of energy to reach the water surface. For this reason, and because of the type of [[sediment]] found with the fossils, it is suggested placodonts lived in shallow waters and not in deep oceans. 
 
 === Feeding === 
 The placodonts ate shellfish. Their front teeth stuck out: they would be used to dig up the shellfish, and pull them from any attachment to the ground. Inside their mouth, the teeth were large and flat: they were used to crush the shells. 
 
 : " Spade-like incisors at the front, for snipping and scraping [[oyster]]s from the rocks; and broad circular back teeth that acted as a pounding board to crush the shells, before the flesh was swallowed " . Benton. < ref name=reign/ > < sup > p119 < /sup > 
 
 Their diet consisted of marine [[bivalve]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, and other [[invertebrate]]s.
