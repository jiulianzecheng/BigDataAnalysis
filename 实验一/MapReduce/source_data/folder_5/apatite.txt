 '''Apatite''' is a group of [[phosphate]] [[minerals]] with high concentrations of [[Hydroxide|OH]] < sup > − < /sup > , [[Fluoride|F]] < sup > − < /sup > , [[Chloride|Cl]] < sup > − < /sup >  or [[ion]]s, respectively, in the [[crystal]]. 
 
 Apatite is characteristic of biological systems. It is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. It hardness defines 5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of [[tooth enamel]] and [[bone mineral]]. 
 
 Much [[bone]] material is in a relatively rare form of apatite. In this form most of the OH groups are absent, and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions. 
 
 '''Fluorapatite''' (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite. In the mid-20th century it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. < ref name=NICDR > {{cite web |url=http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/OralHealth/Topics/Fluoride/TheStoryofFluoridation.htm |title=The story of fluoridation |publisher=National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research |date=July 2018 }} < /ref >   Fluoridated water allows exchange in the [[tooth|teeth]] of fluoride ions for [[Hydroxyl#Hydroxyl group|hydroxyl groups]] in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste often includes a source of fluoride [[anions]] (e.g. sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate).
