 ==History==

 AGCO was created in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation KHD (Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz). KHD was a German company that owned the [[Deutz-Fahr]] brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had bought parts of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier. < ref name= " History of AGCO " > {{cite web|url=http://www.agcocorp.com/company/history.aspx|title=History of AGCO|website=History of AGCO}} < /ref >
