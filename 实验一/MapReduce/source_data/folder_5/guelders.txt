 {{about|the historical county and duchy of Guelders|other meanings|Gelderland}} 
 '''Guelders''' or '''Gueldres''' ({{lang-nl|Gelre}}, {{lang-de|Geldern}}) is the name of a historical county. This became a duchy (''lands ruled by a duke or duchess'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in the [[Low Countries]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 The duchy was named after the town of [[Geldern]] (''Gelder'') in what is now called [[Germany]]. The present province of [[Gelderland]] (English also ''Guelders'') in the [[Netherlands]] occupies most of the area. However, the former duchy also included parts of the present Dutch province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the territories in the present-day German [[States of Germany|state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] that were acquired by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1713.  
 
 The duchy had four special parts, which had their own centres: 
 * the quarter of [[Roermond]], also called the Overkwartier (Upper Quarter) or [[Upper Guelders]]. This was upstream on both sides of the [[Maas]]. It included the town of [[Geldern]] as well as [[Erkelenz]], [[Goch]], [[Nieuwstadt]], [[Venlo]] and [[Straelen]]; 
 and was separated from the Lower Quarters (Gelderland): 
 * the quarter of [[Zutphen]], also called the [[Achterhoek]]. This was east of the [[IJssel]] and north to the [[Rhine]]. It included towns like [[Doesburg]], [[Doetinchem]], [[Groenlo]] and [[Lochem]]; 
 * the quarter of [[Arnhem]], also called the [[Veluwe]]. This is west of the IJssel and north to the Rhine, with [[Elburg]], [[Harderwijk]], [[Hattem]] and [[Wageningen]]; 
 * the quarter of [[Nijmegen]], also called the [[Betuwe]]. This part is south of the Rhine and north to the Maas (in between the rivers). It included [[Gendt]], [[Maasbommel]], [[Tiel]] and [[Zaltbommel]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 ===First mention=== 
 The county was first mentioned in about 1096, when [[Gerard I, Count of Guelders|Gerard III]] of [[Wassenberg]] was first documented as  " Count of Guelders " . It was then in the territory of [[Lower Lorraine]], in the area of [[Geldern]] and [[Roermond]]. Its main stronghold was at [[Montfort (Netherlands)|Montfort]] (built [[1260]]). Count Gerard's son [[Gerard II, Count of Guelders|Gerard II]] in 1127 got the County of [[Zutphen County|Zutphen]] in northern [[Hamaland]] by marriage. In the 12th and 13th century, Guelders became larger very quickly downstream along the sides of the [[Maas]], [[Rhine]], and [[IJssel]] rivers. It even claimed the lands in the [[Duchy of Limburg]]. In 1288, it lost the [[Battle of Worringen]] against [[County of Berg|Berg]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]].

 Guelders was often at war with its neighbours. Not only with Brabant, but also with the [[County of Holland]] and the [[Bishopric of Utrecht]]. Its territory did not only grow because of its success in warfare, it also did very well in times of peace. [[William II of Holland|William II]], count of both Holland and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], gave Nijmegen in use to Guelders in return of a loan. However he was not able to repay the debts, so these lands became integral parts of Guelders.  
 
 ===Independent Guelders and the Habsburg Netherlands=== 
 In 1339 Count [[Reginald II of Guelders]] became a [[duke]] as ordered by Holy Roman Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV of Wittelsbach]]. When Reginald died without an heir in 1371, [[William I of Guelders and Jülich|William I of Jülich]] inherited Guelders. In 1423 Guelders passed to the [[House of Egmond]]. Duke [[Adolf of Egmond|Adolf]] was fighting with his father [[Arnold of Egmond|Arnold]] about the inheritance of the land. Arnold came under pressure from the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] duke [[Charles the Bold]], who put him in prison in 1471. When Arnold died in 1473, Duke Charles added Guelders to his [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. 
 
 The last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolf's son [[Charles, Duke of Guelders|Charles of Egmond]] (1492-1538). He increased the size of the duchy northward, and included what is now the Province of [[Overijssel]]. He left the duchy to Duke [[William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|William the Rich]] of [[United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] in his will. However, he was not able to hold on to it and Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Habsburg]] soon moved in. Guelders finally lost its independence, when it was united with the [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in 1543. 
 
 ===Spain and the Dutch Revolt of the 1560s=== 
 Charles V stood down in 1556. He decided that the territories of the [[Burgundian Circle]] should be part of the [[monarchy of Spain]]. The northern Netherlands stood up against King [[Philip II of Spain]] in the [[Dutch Revolt]]. The three northern quarters of [[Gelderland]] joined the [[Union of Utrecht]] and became part of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] when the 1581 [[Act of Abjuration]] was agreed. Only the Upper Quarter remained a part of the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]].  
 
 The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1713. The [[Upper Guelders|Spanish Upper Quarter]] was again divided between [[Prussian Guelders]] ([[Geldern]], [[Viersen]], [[Horst aan de Maas|Horst]], [[Venray]]), the United Provinces ([[Venlo]], [[Montfort (Limburg)|Montfort]], [[Echt, Limburg|Echt]]), [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] ([[Roermond]], [[Niederkrüchten]], [[Weert]]), and the [[Duchy of Jülich]] ([[Erkelenz]]).  
 
 In 1795 Guelders was conquered and incorporated by the [[French First Republic]]. It was divided between the départements of [[Roer (department)|Roer]] and [[Meuse-Inférieure]].
