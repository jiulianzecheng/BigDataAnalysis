 '''Rinks''' are places for sports. There are several types of rinks: 
 
 *  " Ice rinks "  are also called ice skating rinks. Ice rinks have [[ice]] on the floor if they are inside, and on the ground if they are outside. Ice rinks are places for people to play [[ice hockey]] and to go [[ice skating]]. 
 
 *  " Curling rinks "  also have ice on the floor if they are inside, and on the ground if they are outside. A sport called  " [[curling]] "  is played at curling rinks. Teams of people slide heavy stones with handles down the ice toward targets under the ice. 
 
 *  " Roller rinks "  are also called Roller Skating Rinks. Roller rinks usually have wood on the floor if they are inside, and on the ground if they are outside. People go [[roller skating]] at roller rinks. 
 
 *  " Challenge rinks "  are a lesser-known variant of curling rinks. They can usually be found around or on areas with an elevation of at least 510 meters above sea level.
