 The '''Bundesverdienstkreuz''' (Federal Cross of Merit) is [[Germany|Germany's]] only general decoration ([[award]]). It is officially called the ''Verdienstorden der Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany). This [[Federalism|Federal]] Order of Merit was created on 7 September 1951. Germany gives between 3,000 and 5,200 awards every year, in all classes. 
 
 Most of the [[States of Germany|Länder]] have their own orders of merit. There are up to three ranks (member, officer, commander). The Cities of [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]] do not have an order, and by old tradition its citizens will refuse any decoration in form of an order. 
 
 == Classes == 
 The Bundesverdienstkreuz has eight classes, in [[wikt:ascend|ascending]] order: 
 * Verdienstmedaille (Medal of Merit) 
 * Verdienstkreuz am Bande (Cross of Merit on ribbon) 
 ** international: Ritterkreuz (Knight's Cross) 
 * Verdienstkreuz 1. Klasse (Cross of Merit, First class) 
 ** international: Offizierkreuz (Officer's Cross) 
 * Großes Verdienstkreuz (Halskreuz) (Great Cross of Merit, neck cross) 
 ** international: Komturkreuz (Commander's Cross) 
 * Großes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern (Great Cross of Merit with star) 
 ** international: Großoffizierkreuz (Great Officer's Cross) 
 * Großes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern und Schulterband (Great Cross of Merit with Star and shoulder ribbon) 
 ** international: Großkreuz 2. Klasse (Grand Cross of Merit, Second class) oder Großkomturkreuz (Grand Commander's Cross) 
 * Großkreuz (Grand Cross) 
 * Sonderstufe des Großkreuzes (Special class of the Grand Cross) 
 
 The President of the Federal Republic holds the ''Sonderstufe des Großkreuzes'' [[ex officio]]. It is awarded to him in a ceremony by the [[Bundestag|President of the Bundestag]]. The [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|President of the Bundesrat]] and the President of the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht]] attend this ceremony. Other than the President of the Federal Republic, only a foreign [[head of state]] can receive the highest class award. People can also receive the Großkreuze in a special rare design. Only two people have had this award, [[Konrad Adenauer]] and [[Helmut Kohl]].
