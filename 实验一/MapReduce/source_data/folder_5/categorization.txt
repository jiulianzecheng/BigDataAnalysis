 '''Categorization''' is the fact that people recognize similarities of different things, and put these things into groups, called [[Category|categories]]. Categorization is one of the most fundamental [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]]. As such it is studied by [[Psychologist|psychologists]] and people interested in [[behaviour]]. People form these categories either because of other things they know (pre-existing knowledge), or by comparing them with other similar entities.  
 
 While the categories use in science rarely have exceptions, categories in everyday life often do.  
 
 As an example: Neither [[Rhea (bird)|Rheas]] nor [[Ostrich|ostriches]] can fly, yet even children will classify them as birds.   
 
 Today, scientists tell us that other [[Animal|animals]], such as the [[Great ape|great apes]], [[Horse|horses]] or even [[Dove|doves]] have the ability to form categories.
