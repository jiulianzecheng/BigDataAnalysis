 An '''aurora''', also called '''polar light''', '''northern light''' or '''southern light''', is a natural light display in the sky. They are usually seen in the high latitudes ([[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]) regions. Auroras are produced when the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] is disturbed by the [[solar wind]].

 An aurora around the [[North Pole]] is called the ''Aurora borealis'' or 'northern lights'. Around the [[South Pole]] is the ''Aurora australis'' or 'dawn of the south' or 'southern lights'. It can be seen from long distances, stretching in the sky many hundreds of [[mile|miles]]. 
 
 Auroras can happen at any time, however, they can only be seen at night because their light is not as intense as the light of day. Faint stars can even be seen through the aurora. 
 
 Many legends are associated with the aurora in all countries where this phenomenon regularly occurs. 
 
 == How it happens == 
 An aurora occurs when the [[Sun]] sends off small [[particle]]s into space. These particles are mainly [[electrons]], < ref > McIlwain C.E. 1960. Direct measurement of particles producing visible auroras. ''Journal of Geophysical Research''. '''65''': 2727. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JZ065i009p02727/abstract;jsessionid=C121DB9B2BD1AB7DEC2EEEC64FE23F0D.f03t01] < /ref >  with charge and [[energy]], which means they contribute to [[electricity]]. Earth has a protective shield of energy around it. This is called the  " [[magnetic field]] "  and forms an elongated sphere around the Earth called the  " [[magnetosphere]] " . The [[Earthâ€™s magnetic field]] keeps off most solar wind.  
 
 At high-[[latitude]] areas (polar areas), the magnetic field is vertical. It does not keep off particles of the solar wind which can come from the magnetosphere and hit the particles of the air (Earth's [[atmosphere]]). When they hit, the atmosphere is heated and excited and the excess gets away, a phenomenon which we see as moving lights in the sky above 100 km altitude typically. An aurora can be especially bright following a [[solar flare]] and coronal mass ejection (CME) when the [[charged particle|charged particles]] rips through the electromagnetic field because of their power. 
 
 == On other planets ==

 Auroral phenomena have been observed on other planets that have a magnetic field, such as [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]]. It is believed to be a widespread phenomenon in the [[Solar System]] and beyond.
