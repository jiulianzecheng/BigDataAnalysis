 '''Cephalocarida''' is a [[class (biology)|class]] inside the sub[[phylum]] [[Crustacean|Crustacea]] that has only twelve [[shrimp]]-like benthic [[species]]. They were discovered in 1955, and are commonly referred to as '''horseshoe shrimps'''. 
 
 All cephalocaridans are in just one family: '''Hutchinsoniellidae'''. Even though there is no [[fossil]] record of cephalocaridans, most specialists believe them to be [[basal]] (primitive) among crustaceans. 
 
 == Description and anatomy == 
 These crustaceans are from {{convert|2|to|4|mm}} in length, with a long body. They have no eyes, and live in a [[mud]]dy natural [[habitat]]. < ref name=IZ > {{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|page= 672|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}} < /ref > 
 
 The structural and functional similarity between the maxillae and the legs may be a sign of primitive organization; the maxillae are not specialized, as they are in other crustaceans. < ref name=IZ / > 
 
 The [[thorax]] consists of 10 segments, and the abdomen bears a [[telson]] but no other appendages. 
 
 == Ecology == 
 Cephalocaridans are found from the [[intertidal zone]] down to a depth of 1500 metres, in all kinds of [[sediment]]s. They feed on marine [[detritus]]. To bring in food particles, they make water currents with the thoracic appendages like the [[branchiopod]]s and the [[malacostraca]]ns. Food particles are passed forward along a [[ventral]] groove, leading to the mouthparts. < ref > L.A. Zenkevich. ''Animal life'' (Zhizn' Zhivotnykh) vol 2, chapter 7: Phylum Arthropoda. < /ref >
