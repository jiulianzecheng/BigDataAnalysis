 The '''Caiman''' is a [[subfamily]] of the [[Alligator]]s. The alligators are divided into [[True alligator]]s and caimans. Caimans and true alligators develop slower than the rest of the crocodiles. Their lifestyle is also slower. Because of this, they grow older than the other crocodiles. In total, there are 6 [[species]] of caimans. All of them live in [[South America]], the [[Spectacled Caiman]] can also be found in [[Central America]]. 
 
 There are three groups: 
 
 * [[True Caiman]] (''Caiman'') 
 ** [[Musky caiman]]'' 
 ** [[Spectacled Caiman]] (''C. Crocodilus'') 
 ** [[Yacare Caiman]] (''C. Yakare'') 
 ** [[Broad-snouted caiman]] (''C. latirostris'') 
 
 * [[Paleosuchus]] (''Dwarf caimans?'') 
 ** [[Cuvier's Dwarf Caiman]] 
 ** [[Smooth-fronted Caiman]] (''P. trigonatus)''), also known as ''Schneider's Smooth-fronted Caiman'' 
 * [[Black Caiman]] (''Melanosuchus niger'') (h) (only member of Melanosuchus)
