 '''Deciduous''' means  " temporary "  or  " tending to fall off "  (deriving from the [[Latin]] word ''decidere'', to fall off). 
 When talking about [[plant]]s this means that the plant loses its leaves, usually in [[autumn]]. The leaves will then grow again in [[spring]]. 
 
 When referring to teeth, it means the teeth at the front of the mouth that grow and fall out and are replaced in childhood. They are called [[:en:Deciduous teeth | deciduous teeth]]. 
 
 In [[botany]] and [[horticulture]], '''deciduous plants''' are [[tree]]s, [[shrubs]] and [[herbaceous]] perennials which lose all of their [[leaves]] for part of the year. < ref > {{cite web | url =http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/ecotree/leaves/decidu.htm | title =Trees that lose their leaves | author =University of the Western Cape | publisher =botany.uwc.ac.za | access-date =2016-02-12 | archive-date =2014-10-28 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141028000642/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/ecotree/leaves/decidu.htm | url-status =dead }} < /ref >  This is called abscission. < ref > {{cite web | url =http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/service/library/for99-025/for99-025.pdf | title =Falling tree leaves: leaf abscission | author =Dr. Kim D.

 With [[evergreen]]s, foliage is shed differently from deciduous trees. They seem green year round. < ref > {{cite web | url =http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/sc229.pdf | title =Evergreen Shrubs and Trees for Pennsylvania | author =J.

Glossary of Botanical Terms. Page 22. |accessdate=2013-07-17}} < /ref >  Other plants are semi-evergreen and lose their leaves before the next growing season, keeping some in winter or dry periods. < ref > Weber, William. 2001. ''African rain forest ecology and conservation an interdisciplinary perspective''. New Haven: Yale University Press. page 15. < /ref >  Some trees, including a few species of [[oak]], have [[dessication|desiccated]] leaves that stay on the tree through winter. These persistent dry leaves are dropped in the spring as new growth begins. 
 
 Many deciduous plants [[flower]] during the period when they are leafless, as this increases the effectiveness of [[pollination]]. Not having [[leaf|leaves]] also improves wind transmission of pollen for wind-pollinated plants and increases the visibility of the flowers to [[insect]]s in insect-pollinated plants.
