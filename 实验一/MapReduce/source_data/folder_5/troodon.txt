 '''''Troodon''''' (or '''''Troödon''''') is a [[genus]] of relatively small, bird-like [[dinosaur]]s, from the later part of the [[Cretaceous]] period, 75 - 65 million years ago. < ref > Paul G.S. 1988. ''Predatory dinosaurs of the world''. New York: Simon and Schuster, p. 396. {{ISBN|0-671-61946-2}} < /ref >  The alternate spelling ''Troödon'' shows that the ''''o''''s are pronounced separately, as in 'zoology'. 
 
 They were probably [[carnivorous]], but details of their teeth are a bit unusual. Some experts suggest they may have included plant material in their diet, but this is not a majority view. 
 
 Discovered in central [[Montana]] in 1855, it was among the first dinosaurs found in [[North America]]. Its species ranged widely, with fossil remains recovered from as far north as [[Alaska]], and the [[Judith River]] formation of [[Alberta]], and as far south as [[Wyoming]] and even possibly [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]]. < ref name=Mac > Mackovicky, Peter J.  &  Norell, Mark A. 2004. Troodontidae. In Weishampel, David B; Dodson, Peter  &  Osmólska, Halszka. ''The Dinosauria''. 2nd ed, Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 184–195. {{ISBN|0-520-24209-2}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Troodon'' had a large brain in proportion to its body weight. It had a [[sickle]] [[claw]], an enlarged and [[wikt:retract|retractable]] second toe claw bone. ''Troodon'' had 122 teeth. < ref name=Mac/ >  The size and shape of the leg bones show that the ''Troodon'' would have been a fast runner. < ref name=Mac/ >   
 The view that ''Troodon'' was a predator is supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good [[binocular vision]]. 
 
 ''Troodon''s size ranged widely. In general, individuals that lived further north were larger than those that lived in more southern areas. ''Troodons'' in Alaska were especially large, up to 12 feet long, 5 feet tall, and weighing up to 175 pounds. Meanwhile, ''Troodons'' that lived in more southern locations were only around 7 feet long, 3 feet tall, and weighed up to 50 pounds, about the size of a ''[[Velociraptor]]''. Very likely ''Troodon'' had [[feathers]], but no fossil evidence for feathers has yet been found. 
 
 There has been a lot of debate about which specimens, all very incomplete, should be called ''Troodon''. The [[genus]] now includes specimens previously classified as ''[[Stenonychosaurus]]''. 
 
 ''Troodon'' nests full of eggs have been found in [[Montana]]. When scientists CAT-scanned them, they found baby Troodon skeleton [[embryo]]s inside of them. They found skeletons of a small plant-eating dinosaur named ''[[Orodromeus]]'' with the eggs, as well as a skeleton of an adult Troodon. At first, it was believed that the eggs had belonged to the ''Orodromeus'', and that the Troodon was there intending to rob the nest. < ref name= " Horner84 " > Horner, John R. 1984.  " The nesting behavior of dinosaurs " . ''Scientific American'', '''250''':130-137. < /ref > 
 
 However, it was later discovered that the eggs belonged to the ''Troodon'' when baby ''Troodon'' embryos were found inside the eggs. It is now believed that the adults had killed the ''Orodromeus'' and brought them back to feed their babies. < ref name= " Varrichioetal.02 " > {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Varricchio | first1 = David J. | last2 = Horner | first2 = John J. | last3 = Jackson | first3 = Frankie D. | year = 2002 | title = Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' | url = | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 564–576 | s2cid = 85728452 }} < /ref >  ''Troodon''s laid up to 24 eggs in their nests which were earth mounds. They were able to lay two eggs at a time, so large clutches would take two weeks to lay. < ref name=Mac/ > 
 
 A 2017 description had redeemed the validity of ''[[Stenonychosaurus]]'' and had created a new genus from separate bones naming them ''[[Lateniventrix]]'', limiting ''Troodon'' to a few teeth. < ref > van der Reest A.J.  &  Currie P.J. 2017.
