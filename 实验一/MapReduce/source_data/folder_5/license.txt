 A '''license''' (in [[American English]]) or '''licence''' (in [[British English]]) allows someone to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Synonyms of license {{!}} Thesaurus.com|url=https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/license|access-date=2021-06-29|website=www.thesaurus.com|language=en}} < /ref >  A person usually has to pay some [[money]], and maybe pass a [[test]] to get a license. A license is usually written but it does not have to be. Most kinds of licenses can only be used by the person they were given to. Licenses may be temporary or permanent. Some licenses can not be taken away once they are given. A person with a license is called a '''licensee'''. < ref > {{Cite web|title=license|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/license|access-date=2021-06-29|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 In many countries, if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it, they might have to pay a [[fine]] or go to [[prison]]. 
 
 ==Examples of licenses== 
 There are many different types of licenses. 
 
 ===Driver's license=== 
 The [[law]]s of most [[country|countries]] say that people are only allowed to drive [[car]]s if they have a [[driver's license]].  If a person does not have a license, they may have to pay a [[fine]] if they are caught by the [[police]].  In many countries, a person must take a test and pay money to get a license. The test would check that they know the road rules, and have the skill to drive a car. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Driving licenses|url=https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/driving-licence|access-date=2021-06-29|website=Thales Group|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Hunting license=== 
 Other licenses give permission to [[shoot]] [[animal]]s (often called a [[hunting]] license). The hunting license usually says when a person may hunt. A hunter may have to pass a test to show that they understand the rules about hunting. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Hunting Licenses and Permits {{!}} Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries|url=https://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/page/hunting-licenses-and-permits|access-date=2021-06-29|website=www.wlf.louisiana.gov}} < /ref >

 === Copyright licenses === 
 Copyright is a law that gives the owner of a creative work the right to decide what other people can do with it. A [[person]] or a [[company]] can give a license to a [[copyright]] that they own. So in order for another person to use an owner's copyright they need permission from the owner. For example, when someone buys [[computer software]], they also need a license from the creator of the software (a copyright owner) allowing the buyer to use the software. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Copyright License Definition: 3k Samples|url=https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/copyright-license|access-date=2021-06-29|website=Law Insider|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Collister|first=Lauren|title=LibGuides: Copyright and Intellectual Property Toolkit: Creative Commons, Copyleft, and Other Licenses|url=https://pitt.libguides.com/copyright/licenses|access-date=2021-06-29|website=pitt.libguides.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Difference between license and licence == 
 " License "  is a [[verb]] and  " licence "  is a [[noun]].  " Licensing sessions "  were the meetings of [[magistrates]] which decided about giving licences to sell [[alcohol]].   
 
 In [[American English]] there is no difference in spelling between the verb  " to license "   meaning to give permission, and the noun  " a license "  meaning the permission to do something. 
 
 == Distinction between a licence and a qualification == 
 A degree in medicine is a qualification showing a person has successfully studied medicine. It is awarded for life. A licence to practice medicine is a legal permission to do so within the territory covered by the licensing authority. The licence may be taken away ('revoked') in certain situations.
