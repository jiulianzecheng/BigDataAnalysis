 '''Pelodryadidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of frogs.  They are named '''Australian treefrogs''' in English.  They live in [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]].  Human beings also [[Introduced species|brought them]] to [[New Caledonia]], [[Guam]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Vanuatu]]. Some scientists say these frogs should be called a subgroup inside the group [[Hylidae]].  They call this family Pelodryadinae. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Pelodryadidae Günther, 1858 {{!}} Amphibian Species of the World|url=https://amphibiansoftheworld.amnh.org/Amphibia/Anura/Pelodryadidae|access-date=2021-05-04|website=amphibiansoftheworld.amnh.org}} < /ref > 
 
 Most of the frogs in Pelodryadidae [[arboreal|live in trees]] but some do not. 
 
 Scienitsts think of Pelodryadidae as a sister group to the leaf frogs ([[Phyllomedusidae]]). Those frogs [[Arboreal locomotion|live in trees]] and live in [[Neotropical realm|tropical places]]. Both families of frogs came from the same ancestor frog.  Scientists think this frog lived during the early [[Cenozoic]] in South America. The two groups of frogs would have become different from each other during the [[Eocene]]. The ancestors of the Pelodryadidae frogs probably went to [[Australasia]] by going to [[Antarctica]] first.  At the time, Antarctica was further north and not frozen, so frogs could live there. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Duellman|first1=William E.|last2=Marion|first2=Angela B.|last3=Hedges|first3=S.
