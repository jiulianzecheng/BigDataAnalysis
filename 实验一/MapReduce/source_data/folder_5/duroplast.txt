'''Duroplast''' is a [[resin]] [[plastic]] made up mixing [[Formica (plastic)|formica]] and [[bakelite]] reinforced with fibres (either [[cotton]] or [[wool]]) or [[glass]] fibres. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Duroplast was used by Eastern European automobile manufacturer [[Sachsenring AG|VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau]] to produce the body of the popular [[Trabant]] motor car, toilet seats, and parts for the [[BMW X3]]. 
 
 Duroplast was first used in the body of the [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|IFA]] [[IFA F8|F8]] and later also the [[Zwickau (car)|AWZ]] P70 or Zwickau P70 and later used in the body of the Trabant. Apart from the use in cars duroplast was also used to make [[suitcase]]s. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 Duroplast is [[light]], [[flexible]], and [[strong]]. It was also made of recycled material, cotton waste from Russia and [[phenol]] resins from the East German dye industry making the Trabant the first car with a body made of recycled material[https://www.pbs.org/saf/transcripts/transcript402.htm#4] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075913/http://www.pbs.org/saf/transcripts/transcript402.htm#4 |date=2015-07-03 }}. Because it can be made in a press similar to shaping steel, it's easy to produce. 
 
 ==Critics== 
 Duroplast cannot be completely recycled, and burning it produces toxic fumes, so disposing of the bodies of old [[Trabant]]s is a problem. There are stories of [[pigs]], [[sheep]] or other domestic farm animals consuming duroplast. 
 
 A Berlin biotechnology company claims that it has developed a solution to the duroplast problem: a bacterium that will eat a Trabant in 20 days and leave only compost.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 
 In the last years the Duroplast was smashed and put cement blocks for pavement construction.
