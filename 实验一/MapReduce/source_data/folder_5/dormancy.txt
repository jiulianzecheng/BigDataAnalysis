 '''Dormancy''' is a period in an [[organism|organism's]] [[life cycle]] when growth, development, and (in animals) physical activity are temporarily stopped. This minimizes [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] and therefore helps an organism to conserve [[energy]]. Dormancy tends to be closely associated with [[Ecosystem|environmental conditions]]. Organisms can synchronize entry to a dormant phase with their [[Ecosystem|environment]] through predictive or consequential means. 
 
 '''Predictive dormancy''' occurs when an organism enters a dormant phase ''before'' the onset of adverse conditions. For example, [[day length]] and decreasing [[temperature]] are used by many [[plant]]s as [[wikt:trigger|triggers]] to start dormancy before the onset of winter. 
 
 '''Consequential dormancy''' occurs when organisms enter a dormant phase ''after'' adverse conditions arise. This is often found in areas with an unpredictable climate. Sudden changes in conditions may lead to a high [[mortality rate]] among animals relying on consequential dormancy. On the other hand, its use can be advantageous, as organisms remain active longer and are able to make greater use of available resources. 
 
 == Animals == 
 *[[Hibernation]]: Hibernation is a mechanism used by many mammals to save energy and survive food shortage over the winter. Hibernation may be predictive or consequential. 
 *[[Diapause]]: Diapause is a predictive strategy controlled by an animal's [[genotype]]. It is common in insects between autumn and spring. 
 *[[Aestivation]]: Aestivation is consequential dormancy in response to very hot or dry conditions. It is common in invertebrates, and also occurs in [[lungfish]], [[salamanders]], desert [[tortoises]], and [[crocodiles]]. 
 *Brumation: Brumation is dormancy in [[reptiles]] similar to [[hibernation]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://lllreptile.com/info/library/care-and-husbandry-articles/-/reptilian-brumation/|title=Reptilian Brumation|access-date=2018-01-11|archive-date=2010-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829180043/http://lllreptile.com/info/library/care-and-husbandry-articles/-/reptilian-brumation/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It differs from hibernation in the metabolic processes involved. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://infinitespider.com/hibernating-mammals-brumating-reptiles-whats-difference/|title=Hibernating Mammals and Brumating Reptiles: What's the Difference?|date=20 January 2014 }} < /ref >  Reptiles usually start brumation in late autumn. They often wake up to drink water and return to  " sleep " .  They can go for months without food. 
 
 == Plants == 
 === Development from the seed === 
 A [[seed]], though not active, is a tiny living thing. It contains the [[embryo]] of the future plant, which is not changing or developing: it is ''dormant''. The common idea is that the seed  " sleeps "  until it gets what it needs to wake up. That is not correct. Different seeds have different habits, no doubt adapted to their [[habitat]]. There are different kinds of resting stages in seeds: < ref name= " Baskin, C.C 1998 " > Baskin C.C.  &  Baskin J.M. 1998. ''Seeds: ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination''. Academic Press, [[San Diego]]. < /ref > 
 :1. Seed '''dormancy''': means the seed does not develop for a while ''even when conditions are suitable''. < ref name= " Fenner " > Fenner, Michael and Thompson, Ken 2005. ''The ecology of seeds''. Cambridge. {{ISBN|9780521653688}} < /ref > < sup > p98 < /sup >  Delayed [[germination]] (development) allows time for dispersal. Changes take place inside the seed which sooner or later make it germinate. The details vary hugely between [[species]]. 
 :2. Seed '''hibernation''': fails to germinate because conditions are not right. Growth is [[wikt:trigger|triggered]] by particular events in the [[environment]]. Details of the triggers are known for some, but not all, seeds. [[Rain]], [[fire]], ground [[temperature]], are examples. Many seeds only germinate after they have been [[eaten]] and passed through the [[digestive system]] of an animal. This also is a dispersal method. 
 
 When a seed germinates ( " wakes up " ), it begins to grow into a little plant called a ''seedling''. < ref name= " Baskin, C.C 1998 " / >  It uses the soft fleshy [[material]] inside the seed for nutrients (food) until it is ready to make food on its own using sunlight, water and air. 
 
 Most seeds germinate underground where there is no sunlight. The plant does not need the nutrients in soil for a few days or weeks, because the seed has all the things it needs to grow. < ref name=Fenner/ >  Later, though, it will begin to need sunlight. If there is sunlight, the plant will use it to grow healthy. If there is no light, the plant will still grow for a while, but its [[plastid]]s will not mature: the chlorophyll does not turn green. If the plant does not get enough light, it will eventually die. It needs light to make food for itself when the reserve in the seed runs out. < ref name= " Baskin, C.C 1998 " / > 
 
 * The oldest [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon 14]]-dated seed that has grown into a plant was a Judean [[date palm]] seed about 2,000 years old, recovered from excavations at [[Agrippa I|Herod the Great]]'s palace on [[Masada]] in [[Israel]]. It was germinated in 2005. < ref > Roach, John. 2005.

 * The largest seed is produced by the ''Coco de mer'', or  " double coconut palm " , ''Lodoicea maldivica''.  The entire fruit may weigh up to 23 kilograms (50 pounds) and usually contains a single seed. < ref > {{cite book |title=The natural history of Palms |author=Corner EJH |year=1966 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=313â€“4 }} < /ref >
