 '''Ravenscraig''' is an area of land in [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]].  It used to be the site for [[steelwork]]s. Ravenscraig used to have the largest [[steel]] mill in Western [[Europe]]. Ravenscraig was closed in 1992, and is now almost completely gone. 
 
 Ravenscraig is now at the start of a big redevelopment by [[Wilson Bowden|Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd]], [[Scottish Enterprise]] and [[Corus]], to create a full new town. 
 
 == Location == 
 Ravenscraig is very easy to get to. More than two—thirds of Scotland’s population live within 90 minutes drive. 
 
 Located in [[North Lanarkshire]], Ravenscraig is between the towns of [[Wishaw]] and [[Motherwell]], who house a population of over 60,000. 
 
 Ravenscraig lies only a few minutes drive from both the [[M74 motorway|M74]] and the [[M8 motorway|M8]] motorways which lead to [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]'s two biggest cities. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Image:Ravenscraig Steel Mill.jpg|thumb|left|Ravenscraig Rolling Mills in 1985]] 
 Another steel maker, [[Colvilles]], decided to expand their business in July 1954. They were the largest steel manufacturer before [[World War II]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/steelworks/Colville%27s.htm |title=The Company and Its Allied Concerns - Colville's Magazine, 1920 |access-date=2008-10-29 |archive-date=2008-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922162736/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/steelworks/Colville%27s.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=campbell > Campbell, R.

Glasgow: William Collins Sons  &  Co. Ltd. < /ref > 
 
 In 1954, Colvilles began the first stages of development in Ravenscraig, that turned Ravenscraig from an empty field into a site for steelworks. By 1957 most of the machinery was built and by 1959 the full building work was complete. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/steelworks/Steelworks%20Ravenscraig.htm |title=Ravenscraig Steel Works History 1954 - 1992 |access-date=2008-10-29 |archive-date=2008-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123051616/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/steelworks/Steelworks%20Ravenscraig.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 When Ravenscraig closed in 1993, that was the end of most steel making in Scotland. < ref name=s & t > Stratton, Michael and  Trinder, Barry (2000). ''Twentieth Century Industrial Archaeology''.

 == Current State == 
 
 In its current state, Ravenscraig is one of the largest [[derelict]] sites in [[Europe]] measuring over 1125 acres in size. Ravenscraig is the same size as an area of 700 football pitches and double the size of [[Monaco]]. < ref > [http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q & hl=en & geocode= & time= & date= & ttype= & q=ravenscraig,+motherwell & sll=54.162434,-3.647461 & sspn=12.497202,29.619141 & ie=UTF8 & ll=55.791438,-3.94495 & spn=0.023403,0.05785 & z=14 & om=1 Google Maps] < /ref > < ref > [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2000/01/9cc8e10e-0b9b-4ba2-a157-0100a809870d Scottish Government - (Henry McLeish backs plans for Ravenscraig Regeneration)] < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.ravenscraig.co.uk/index.asp |title=Ravenscraig.co.uk Homepage |access-date=2008-10-29 |archive-date=2008-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103043418/http://www.ravenscraig.co.uk/index.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Future Plans == 
 
 After many years of planning, Ravenscraig will be rebuilt by three equal companies: [[Wilson Bowden|Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd]], [[Scottish Enterprise]] and [[Corus]] and will be one of the largest regenerations in [[Europe]], with 400 acres being developed. 
 
 Ravenscraig will have lots of new facilities:

 Part of the development will be to make new habitats for the wildlife that live in the area, such as [[deer]], [[fox]]es, [[hare]]s, [[otter]]s, [[badger]]s, [[watervole]]s, [[butterflies]] and many [[birds]]. An  " Ecological Clerk of Works "  has been appointed to make sure the building works do not harm the wildlife. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.ravenscraig.co.uk/natural-heritage.asp |title=- Ravenscraig - Natural Heritage |access-date=2008-10-29 |archive-date=2012-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226124951/http://www.ravenscraig.co.uk/natural-heritage.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 It is hoped that the [[£]]29million sports complex will be used as a training camp for the [[2012 London Olympics]] and the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]]. < ref > [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2007/10/30121839 Scottish Government - (£29m for Ravenscraig sports complex)] < /ref > 
 
 There are many people who disagree with the building work. Many local residents and small businesses think that it will take jobs and customers from other towns. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3363471.stm BBC News - Controversy over steelworks plan] < /ref > 
 
 === Transport === 
 As part of the changes, the transport to Ravenscraig will get better. There will be new transport within walking distance of the new town centre, with buses going to [[Glasgow]], [[Lanark]] and many other towns. There will be easy access to public transport throughout Ravenscraig that will include business routes, that will link to the public transport network with roads to the [[Motherwell]] and [[Carfin]] rail stations. < ref > [http://www.ravenscraig.co.uk/ Ravenscraig.co.uk] < /ref > 
 
 === Motherwell FC === 
 Local press have said that the [[Scottish Premier League]] football team, [[Motherwell FC|Motherwell Football Club]] could buy some land in Ravenscraig to build a new [[stadium|football stadium]], leaving behind their home of 113 years, [[Fir Park]]. Motherwell Chairman, John Boyle has said '' " No decisions have been taken and we are simply exploring realistic options at this stage.
