It is located right above the [[Arctic Circle]] and built near the river [[Vorkuta (river)|Vorkuta]]. After the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the town lost population as the mines were abandoned.  
 
 == History == 
 In 1930, geologist [[Georgy Chernov]] found large amounts of coal fields next to the river Vorkuta. These coal fields were soon developed. This was the start of coal-mining in the [[Komi ASSR]].  
 
 During the [[Cold War]], the [[Vorkuta Sovetsky airbase]] was used as a base for [[Strategic bomber|strategic bombers]] by the [[Soviets]]. 
 
 == Economy == 
 By the early [[21st century]], most of the mines in Vorkuta were closed because of the high costs of keeping them open.  
 
 === Transportation === 
 The small [[Vorkuta Airport]] is located in the town. 
 
 == Climate == 
 Vorkuta has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification system]] ''Dfc'') with short cool summers and cold and snowy winters.{{Weather box
