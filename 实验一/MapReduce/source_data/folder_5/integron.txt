An '''integron''' is a type of [[transposon]], a [[mobile genetic element]]. < ref > King R.C; Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford University Press, p233. {{ISBN|0-19-530-761-5}} < /ref >  It is a two-part [[genetic]] system found in [[bacteria]], and maybe more widely. It is the way [[antibiotic resistance]] is passed on so rapidly. It is found in [[plasmid]]s and [[chromosomes]]. Although the first [[Function (biology)|function]] discovered was antibiotic resistance, other bacterial functions ([[Trait (biology)|traits]]) can be transferred by integrons. 
 
 Transposons are the [[gene]]  " capture and expression elements "  which put  the small mobile elements known as '''gene cassettes''' in place and make them work. < ref > Partridge S.R. ''et al'' 2009. Gene cassettes and cassette arrays in mobile resistance integrons. ''FEMS Microbiology Reviews'', '''33''' (4) 757{{ndash}}784. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00175.x/full] < /ref >  Usually, 
 each cassette has only a single gene and a specific 
 recombination site. The cassettes carry the DNA coding (= 'a gene') for antibiotic resistance (for example). Typically, the DNA would code for an [[enzyme]] which cleaves (cuts) the antibiotic molecule up. 
 
 The first part of an integron is a [[gene]] which codes for an [[enzyme]] which captures cassettes. The second is a site on the [[genome]] where the cassettes are inserted, and a promoter which drives [[gene expression|expression]] of cassette-associated genes.  " Integron "  describes such structures both when no cassettes are present and when there are integrated cassettes. < ref > Hall R.M.  &  Collis C.M. 1995. Mobile gene cassettes and integrons: capture and spread of genes by site-specific recombination. ''Mol Microbiol'' '''15''', 593–600. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7783631?dopt=Abstract]  
 < /ref >  Cassettes can be inserted at the site, they can be cut out, and they can undergo [[horizontal gene transfer]].
