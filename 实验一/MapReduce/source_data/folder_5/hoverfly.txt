 '''Hoverflies''', sometimes called 'flower flies' or 'syrphid flies', are the insect [[family (biology)|family]] '''Syrphidae'''. < ref > Gilbert, Francis S. 1986. ''Hoverflies''. Cambridge University Press, Natural History Handbooks 5. {{ISBN|0-521-27701-9}}. < /ref >  Hoverflies mimic wasp stripes, and are usually smaller than wasps. Thus to a bird they may look scarcely worth eating, and dangerous.  
 
 As their common name suggests, they are often seen hovering or sucking [[nectar]] at [[flower]]s. The adults of many [[species]] feed mainly on [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], while the [[larva]]e ([[maggot]]s) eat a wide range of foods. 
 
 In some species, the larvae are [[saprotroph]]s, eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are [[insectivore]]s and prey on [[aphid]]s, [[thrip]]s, and other plant-sucking insects. 
 
 Aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year. Hoverflies are important [[Predation|natural enemies]] of these [[pest]]s, and can be used in [[biological control]]. Some adult syrphid flies are important [[Pollination|pollinators]]. Some [[orchids]] mimic [[aphid]] alarm scent ([[pheromones]]), which attracts hoverflies. The hoverflies then pollinate the orchids. < ref > Stokl, Johannes; Brodmann; Dafni; Ayasse; Hansson 2011. Smells like aphids: orchid flowers mimic aphid alarm pheromones to attract hoverflies for pollination. ''Proc. R. Soc. B''. '''278''' (1709): 1216–1222. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20943694/] < /ref > 
   
 About 6,000 species in 200 [[genus|genera]] have been described. Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on most continents except [[Antarctica]]. 
 
 Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their [[mimicry]] of the black and yellow stripes of [[wasp]]s. They are a classic example of [[Batesian mimicry]]. The Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing: it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting, but in reality it is good to eat. Hover flies look roughly like little wasps, and their [[warning colouration]] is well-known to birds. 
 
 Unlike adults, the [[maggot]]s of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods. < ref name= " Schmidt " > {{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Martin |last2=Thewes |first2=Ulrich |last3=Thies |first3=Carsten |last4=Tscharntke |first4=Teja |title=Aphid suppression in mulched cereals |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |date=2004 |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=87–93 |doi=10.1111/j.0013-8703.2004.00205.x |s2cid=85070615 }} < /ref >  Predatory species benefit farmers and gardeners, because aphids destroy crops. Hoverfly maggots are often used in [[biological control]].
