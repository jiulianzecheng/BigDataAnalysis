 A '''tsunami''' (from {{lang-ja|津波|lit=harbor wave}} < ref > {{cite web|url=http://nthmp-history.pmel.noaa.gov/terms.html|title=Tsunami Terminology|publisher=[[NOAA]]|access-date=2022-04-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225143835/http://nthmp-history.pmel.noaa.gov/terms.html|archive-date=2011-02-25}} < /ref > )  is a [[natural disaster]] which is a series of fast-moving [[wave]]s in the [[ocean]] caused by powerful [[earthquake|earthquakes,]] [[Volcano|volcanic eruption]]s, [[landslides]], or simply an asteroid or a meteor crash inside the ocean. A tsunami starts as a small wave and builds up into a larger wave., a tsunami starts suddenly. The waves travel at a great [[speed]] across an ocean with little [[energy]] loss. They can remove [[sand]] from [[beach]]es, destroy [[tree]]s, toss and drag [[vehicle]]s, [[house]]s and even destroy whole [[town]]s and cities. Tsunamis can even be caused when a meteorite strikes the earth's surface, though it is very rare. A tsunami normally occurs in the Pacific Ocean, especially in what is called the [[ring of fire]], but can occur in any large body of water like lakes and  seas.                                                                                                                                   If the [[slope]] of the coast is not steep, the water may pull back for hundreds of meters. People who do not know of the danger often remains at the shore. 
 
 Tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are ways to help stop people [[death|dying]] from a tsunami. International and regional warning systems, especially for the [[Pacific Ocean]], issue alerts before the big waves reach the [[shore]]. Because the [[earthquake]] that caused the tsunami can be felt before the wave gets to the shore, people can be warned to go somewhere safe.  
 
 Tsunamis are often called '''seismic sea wave or''' tidal ''waves'' because they usually rise and fall more slowly than ordinary [[ocean surface wave]]s. This name is misleading, because tsunamis are not related to [[tide]]s; they merely rise slowly as a series of fast-moving [[Wave|waves]] in the [[ocean]] caused by powerful [[Earthquake|earthquakes]] or [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]]. 
 
 The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|deadliest tsunami]] recorded in documented history was on 26 December 2004, and is known as the [[2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]]. It was caused by an [[earthquake]]. The earthquake was said to have a magnitude of 9.1 on the [[Moment magnitude scale]]. It was centered in the [[ocean]] near the coast of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. Over 230,000 people, mainly on the shores of the [[Indian Ocean]], died from this [[disaster]]. The giant wave moved very quickly. Thousands of people in [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Somalia]], and other nations, were killed or injured by it. 
 
 Yet, the most ''expensive'' tsunami ever was the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami or Great Sendai Earthquake]] . It is said to have cost the Japanese government around $2200 billion USD, which is equivalent to about 12 trillion yen. It went a huge distance in  inland and mostly effected  Tōhoku region (northeastern Honshu). and it was the 4th largest tsunami in history. 
 
 There is another type of tsunami known as a megatsunami [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatsunami], which is mainly due to external impact on the ocean, like an [[Asteroid]] or [[Meteor]] crash, a [[Landslide]], a rockslide. It is rare for a megatsunami to occur. 
 
 == Surviving tsunamis == 
 Tsunamis are very strong and can go many kilometers inland. Around 5 to 10 minutes before a tsunami hits, the sea seems to go back by an unusual distance. This is a warning that a tsunami can occur.  
 
 The best way to evacuate is to climb to an elevated area. If a person notices strange or unusual behavior in animals, they can also take that as a warning and go inland. However, if it still looks like the wave can absorb the person, the most suitable alternative will be to hold on to something sturdy, like a tree, so they don't totally get carried away and not injured and call the disaster rescue team.
