The '''genotype''' is the [[genetic]] constitution of an organism, mainly its [[genome]]. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. p179 < /ref >  The term is contrasted with the term [[phenotype]], as follows: 
 
 :'''genotype + environment â†’ phenotype''' 
 
 The terms were invented by [[Wilhelm Johanssen]] to distinguish between inherited and environmentally produced [[Variation (biology)|variation]]. < ref > Johannsen W. 1911. The genotype conception of heredity. ''American Naturalist'' '''45''', 129-159 < /ref >   " The distinction was not new. It had, for instance, been discussed by [[Francis Galton]] as ''nature'' vs. ''nurture''. < ref > Sturtevant A.H. 1965. ''History of genetics''. Harper  &  Row, N.Y. p59 < /ref > 
 
 The extent to which the genotype influences the phenotype varies hugely. ''Some'' aspects of the phenotype are almost entirely determined by heredity, such as [[eye colour]] and [[blood type]]s. Human [[language]] is an interesting case. The ''capacity'' to learn and speak a language is entirely inherited, but ''which'' language is spoken is entirely learnt, and hence is environmental.
