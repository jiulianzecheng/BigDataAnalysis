'''Semiotics''' (or '''semiology''') is a theoretical [[framework]] for the study of the meaning of [[language]], [[sign]]s and [[symbols]]. It was first developed in the early [[20th century]], separately, by the Swiss [[Ferdinand Saussure]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] of the U.S.A. It can be described as both a [[science]] and a [[Skill|technique]]: a science because it has its own theories and a technique because it is a way of studying systems of representation and meaning. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the [[Sensory system|senses]], [[Visual system|visual]], [[Auditory system|auditory]], tactile, [[Olfaction|olfactory]], or [[Gustatory system|gustatory]]. 
 
 == History and terminology == 
 The importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of philosophy, and in psychology as well. The term derives from the Greek: σημειωτικός,  < small > romanized: < /small >  ''sēmeiōtikos'',  " observant of signs " < ref > {{Cite web|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, σημει-ωτικός|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=shmeiwtiko/s|access-date=2021-01-22|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}} < /ref >  (from σημεῖον ''sēmeion'',  " a sign, a mark " ). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, σημεῖον|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=shmei=on|access-date=2021-01-22|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}} < /ref >  For the Greeks,  " signs "  occurred in the world of nature, and  " symbols "  in the world of culture. As such, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] explored the relationship between signs and the world. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Signs|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem02.html|access-date=2021-01-22|website=visual-memory.co.uk}} < /ref > 
 
 The general study of signs that began in Latin with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] culminated with the 1632 ''Tractatus de Signis'' of John Poinsot, and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in 1867 by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] to draw up a  " new list of categories. "  More recently, Umberto Eco, in his ''Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language'', has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most, perhaps all, major thinkers.   
 
 '''Semiotics''' is usually divided into three parts: 
 *[[Semantics]] -  what was the meaning of the words or signs used;  
 *[[Pragmatics]] - who said it, to whom and in what circumstances and  
 *[[Syntactics]] - the formal rules of the language used. 
 
 The major branches of semiotics include: 
 *[[Biosemiotics]] 
 *[[Zoosemiotics]] 
 *[[Semiotics of culture]]
