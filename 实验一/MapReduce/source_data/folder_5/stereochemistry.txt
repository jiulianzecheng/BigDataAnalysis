 '''Stereochemistry''' is the study of how [[molecule]]s are affected by the way their [[atom]]s are arranged in space. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/apdst/stereochemistry |title=Stereochemistry |first= |last= |work=Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology  |year=2002 |accessdate=13 August 2011}} < /ref >  It is also known as [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] chemistry as the word ''stereo'' means ''three dimensional''. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stereo- |title=Stereo |first= |last= |work=reference.com |year=2011 |accessdate=13 August 2011}} < /ref >  Using stereochemistry, chemists can work out the relationships between different molecules that are made up from the same atoms. They can also study the effect on the [[physics|physical]] or [[biology|biological]] properties these relationships give molecules. When these relationships influence the [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] of the molecules it is called [[dynamic stereochemistry]].  
 
 In chemistry, some [[molecule]]s have more than one [[isomer]]. This means that molecules can have different forms, even though all the forms are made of the same atoms. There are two kinds of isomers. < ref name=st > {{cite web |url=http://facultystaff.vwc.edu/~jeaster/courseinfo/Tutorials/stereochemistryl.html |title=Stereochemistry Tutorial |first= |last= |work=facultystaff.vwc.edu |year=2001 |accessdate=9 August 2011 |archive-date=28 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828095830/http://facultystaff.vwc.edu/~jeaster/courseinfo/Tutorials/stereochemistryl.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  [[Constitutional isomer]]s have the same atoms, but they are joined differently. < ref name=st/ >  [[Stereoisomer]]s have the same atoms, they are joined the same way, but the atoms are arranged differently in space. < ref name=st/ >  An important part of stereochemistry is the study of [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecules. < ref > {{JerryMarch}} < /ref >  These molecules look almost identical, except that one molecule is the mirror image of the other. 
 
 In most [[chemical bond]]s, the atoms of a molecule free to move around without breaking the bonds. When a molecule has a [[double bond]] or a ring structure, the molecule can be sorted into different isomers. These are molecules with the same chemical structure but different forms. 
 
 The study of stereochemical problems covers the entire range of [[Organic chemistry|organic]], [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]], [[Biochemistry|biological]], [[Physical chemistry|physical]] and [[Supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular]] chemistries. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Louis Pasteur]] was the first person to study stereochemistry. He observed in 1849 that [[salt]]s of [[tartaric acid]] collected from [[wine]]-making equipment could rotate plane [[polarized light]], but that salts from other sources did not. This property was the only difference between the two types of salt. It is due to [[optical isomerism]]. In 1874, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] and [[Joseph Le Bel]] discovered the difference was caused by the way that the [[atom]]s bonded to [[carbon]] in a tetrahedral (four faced) shape. 
 
 ==Uses of stereochemistry== 
 Stereochemistry was important in solving the [[thalidomide]] disaster in the 1960s. Thalidomide is a [[Medication|drug]] that was first produced in 1957 in [[Germany]]. < ref name=collins > {{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/collinsbiology/thalidomide |title=Thalidomide  |first= |last= |work=Collins Dictionary of Biology |year=2005 |accessdate=13 August 2011}} < /ref >  Doctors used it to treat morning sickness in [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women. Later, the drug was shown to cause [[deformation]]s in [[baby|babies]]. < ref name=collins/ >  One isomer of the drug was not dangerous, but the other caused serious [[genetics|genetic]] damage to the [[embryo]]s. In the human body, thalidomide undergoes [[racemization]]: even if only one of the two stereoisomers enters a human body, the body changes some of it to other one. The thalidomide disaster caused governments to test drugs more carefully. Selected people take new drugs in an experiment ([[clinical trial]]) first before the drug is made available for public use. Thalidomide is now used as a [[therapy]] for [[leprosy]]. Women must use it with [[Birth control|contraceptives]] to prevent pregnancy. 
 
 ==Describing a molecule's stereochemistry==

 When an atom can have other atoms connect to it in more than one way, it is called a [[stereocenter]].  For example, if a carbon atom has four different groups attached to it, it becomes a stereocenter. 
 
 [[Cahn Ingold Prelog priority rules|Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules]] are part of a system for describing a molecule's stereochemistry. They rank the atoms around a stereocenter in a standard way. This allows the relative position of these atoms in the molecule to be described very clearly. A [[Fischer projection]] is a simplified way to show the stereochemistry around a stereocenter.
