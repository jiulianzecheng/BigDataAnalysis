 '''Peptidoglycan''' or '''murein''' is a [[polymer]] that makes up the [[Cell wall|cell walls]] of [[bacteria]]. It is made of many [[Sugar|sugars]] (or [[Monosaccharide|monosaccharides]]), and [[Amino acid|amino acids]]. 
 
 Peptidoglycan is made of chains of sugars. Each chain has [[N-acetylglucosamine]] and [[N-acetylmuramic acid]], one after the other. The chains are linked to each other by 4-5 amino acids, and other sugar molecules, such as [[glycine]]. < ref name= " Voet " > {{cite book|title=Biochemistry|url=https://archive.org/details/biochemistryfour00voet|last1=Voet|first1=Donald|last2=Voet|first2=Judith G.|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=9780470570951|edition=4th|pages=[https://archive.org/details/biochemistryfour00voet/page/n405 376]}} < /ref >
