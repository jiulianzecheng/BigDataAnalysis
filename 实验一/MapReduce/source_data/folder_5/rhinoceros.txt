 A '''rhinoceros''' ('''rhino''' for short) is any [[animal]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Rhinocerotidae'''. They are in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Perissodactyla]], or [[odd-toed ungulates]]. There are five living [[species]]. Two of these species are native to [[Africa]].  Three of these species are also native to Southern parts of [[Asia]].

 ** [[White rhinoceros]], or square-lipped rhinoceros ''Ceratotherium simum''

 == Habitat == 
 All five rhinoceros species are native to [[Africa]] or [[Asia]]. The two species in Africa are the White rhinoceros and the Black rhinoceros. The three species in Asia (including islands of [[Indonesia]]) are the Javan rhinoceros, Sumatran rhinoceros, and Indian rhinoceros. 
 
 == Life == 
 [[File:Ceratotherium simum pair Sabi Sand.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[white rhinoceros]] and its calf.]] 
 The rhinoceros is a [[herbivore]]. Its favourite food is plants, branches and bushes (if it is a [[browser]] species), or grass (if it is a [[grazer]] species). 
 
 Rhinoceroses have a large horn on the nose. Their horns are not like those of other horned mammals: the rhinoceros' horn is made of [[keratin]] packed together very tightly.   
 
 The rhinoceroses can weigh up to {{convert|2000|kg|lb}} and be up to {{convert|375|cm|ft}} tall. 
 
 == Rhinoceros and humans == 
 Only the white rhinoceros is not in critical danger of becoming [[extinct]].  They are protected, but hunted mainly by poachers, for their horns.  The horns are used in Asian medicine, similar to elephants and tigers, and for dagger handles in [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]].  Loss of [[habitat]] is also a danger to rhinos.  Governments have made [[logging]] their habitat and [[poaching]] [[illegal]].
