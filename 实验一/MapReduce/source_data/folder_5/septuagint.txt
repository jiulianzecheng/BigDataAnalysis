[[Image:Codex Vaticanus (1 Esdras 1-55 to 2-5) (The S.S. Teacher's Edition-The Holy Bible).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Septuagint:  A column of uncial text from [[1 Esdras]] in the ''[[Codex Vaticanus]]'', the basis of Sir Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton's Greek edition and [[Brenton's English Translation of the Septuagint|English translation]].]] 
 The original '''Septuagint''' (often referred to ''LXX'') was a translation of the [[Torah]], the five books of Moses from the [[Hebrew Bible]] into the [[Greek language]]. It was done between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC in [[Alexandria]]. It was the first translations of the Hebrew Bible. After 350 years, the Church translated all the books of the [[Old Testament]], and it also has books that [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] call the [[deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanon]]. These books are called [[Apocrypha]] by [[Protestant]]s because they do not think these books are [[sacred]]. 
 
 An ancient tradition says that 70 [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars were in different rooms when they translated the [[Torah]] from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] into Greek, yet they all produced exactly the same text. People thought this was a [[miracle]]. The [[Latin language]] word for  " 70 "  is ''septuaginta'', and the word  " Septuagint "  comes from that. Another way to write  " 70 "  is  " LXX "  which is why writers sometimes use that as a short name for Septuagint. 
 
 The Septuagint was used as the starting point for some later translations of the Bible.
