 The '''chondrophores''' or '''porpitids''' are a small and unusual group of [[hydrozoa]]ns. They are the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Porpitidae'''. < ref > [http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/hydrozoa-directory.htm Schuchert, Peter 2012. ''The hydrozoa directory''. Mus√©um Geneve] < /ref > 
 
 They all live at the surface of the open ocean, and are  [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] of [[carnivorous]], free-floating [[hydroid]]s. Their [[life-style]] in the [[plankton]] is similar to that of pelagic [[jellyfish]]. 
 
 The chondrophores look like a single [[organism]] but are  cooperatives of [[polyp]]s. 
 
 The most familiar members of the family Porpitidae are the blue button (''Porpita porpita'') and the by-the-wind sailor (''Velella velella''). 
 
 == Structure == 
 Chondrophores may look like a jellyfish, but they really are not. Like the [[siphonophores]] they are not a single animal. They are a colony of [[clones]], [[genetically]] identical [[zooids]]. These zooids are small, highly modified individual polyps. Though structurally similar to other [[cnidaria]]ns, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself. 
 
 This kind of set-up is also found in the [[siphonophores]]: the [[Portuguese man o' war]]. They evolved independently, and are classified in different [[Order (biology)|orders]]. 
 
 == Fossil record == 
 A rare soft-bodied [[fossil]] was got from  [[Mississippian]] [[strata]] in northeastern [[Kentucky]]. It was interpreted as a chondrophorine float. < ref > Yochelson, Ellis L.  and Mason, Charles E. 1986. A chondrophorine coelenterate from the Borden Formation (Lower Mississippian) of Kentucky, ''Journal of Paleontology''. '''60''', 5, 1025-1028. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1305181] < /ref >  The origin of the group was probably in the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, some 650{{ndash}}540 million years ago.
