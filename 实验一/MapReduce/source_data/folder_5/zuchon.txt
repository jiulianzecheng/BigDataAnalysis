 '''Zuchon''' or '''Shichon''' is a [[Dog crossbreeds|hybrid breed]] dog or a [[designer dog]]. They are a [[crossbreed|cross]] between [[Bichon Frisé]] and [[Shih Tzu]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.achclub.com/modules.php?name=Breeders |title=AMERICAN CANINE HYBRID CLUB HYBRID BREEDS |publisher=American Canine Hybrid Club |date=2014 |access-date=14 February 2015 |archive-date=5 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205032804/http://www.achclub.com/modules.php?name=Breeders |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Sometimes called the 'Teddy Bear' dog, Zuchons are not yet recognized as a breed by the America Kennel Club (AKC).  
   
 The Zuchon is a small designer dog with a height around 12 inches. They weigh 12 to 14 pounds. Because they are a hybrid dog from two purebreds, they are known to have hybrid vigor (extra strength and health). When these dogs are first generation, they could possibly have better health than purebred dogs.

 Because their fur is very low in allergens, people are usually not allergic to Zuchons which makes them a suitable choice for homes with allergy problems. They tend to be well-behaved and are highly intelligent which makes them a trainable breed.  
 
 Zuchons love to spend time with their master and therefore it is not uncommon for them to suffer from separation anxiety which can be troublesome when they are left alone. They are better behaved and less stressed when they are kept company.
