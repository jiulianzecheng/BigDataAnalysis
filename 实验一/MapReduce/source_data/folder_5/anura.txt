 The [[order (biology)|order]] '''Anura''' includes the '''[[frog]]s''' and '''[[toad]]s'''. They are the most successful living [[amphibia]], judged by number of [[species]]. There are about 7400 different species of amphibians, and about 6500 are in the Anura. < ref name= " Pou92 " > {{cite book |title=Herpetology |last=Pough F.H. | display-authors = etal |year=2003 |publisher= 3rd ed, Benjamin Cummings |isbn=0131008498 }} < /ref > < ref name= " numbers " > [http://amphibiaweb.org/amphibian/speciesnums.html AmphibiaWeb] < /ref > 
 
 There is no fundamental difference between frogs and toads. Frogs have a short body, [[webbed feet|webbed digits]] (fingers or toes), protruding eyes, forked tongue and no tail. They are exceptional jumpers: many of their features, particularly their long, powerful legs, are adaptations to improve jumping performance. They often live in semi-aquatic or [[humid]] areas. < ref name=Z/ > 
 
 A popular distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance. The [[wart]]y skin of toads is an [[adaptation]] for making their [[toxic]] [[slime]]. Apart from these glands, their skin is dry, and that is an adaptation to drier [[habitat]]s. These features have evolved a number of times independently: [[convergent evolution]]. The distinction has no [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] basis: the Anura are not divided into frogs and toads. The only family exclusively given the common name  " toad "  is the [[Bufonidae]] (the  " true toads " ), but many species from other families are also called  " toads " . < ref name=Z > Zweifel, Richard G; Cogger H.G.  &  Kirshner D. 1998.

 Frogs have [[wikt:smooth|smooth (soft)]] skin, while toads have [[wikt:rough|rough (hard)]] skin. Frogs need their skin to be wet in order for them to get oxygen. < ref name=Sally > Morgan, Sally 2004. ''Amphibians''. Heinemann-Raintree. {{ISBN|1410910466}} < /ref > < sup > p6 < /sup >  Frogs and toads have [[wikt:broad|broad]] heads and [[wikt:plump|plump]] bodies. < ref name=G > Grenard, Steve 2007. ''Frogs and toads: your happy healthy pet. Wiley. {{ISBN|0470165103}} < /ref > < sup > p6 < /sup >  They have short [[fore limb]]s and long [[webbed feet|webbed hind feet]]. This helps them to move and swim in water. They can also use their legs to [[wikt:crawl|crawl]], [[wikt:hop|hop]] and [[wikt:leap|leap]]. Frogs are good jumpers, and some can leap up to six feet in the air. [[Tree frog]]s can climb on any surfaces, they use their sticky hands to do this. The [[Tympanic membrane|tympanum membrane]] can only be seen on frogs. The tympanum membrane can be found between the frog's ears and eyes. < ref name=G/ >  Frogs have tiny teeth inside their mouths. They are found on the [[lower jaw]]. < ref name=Sally/ > < sup > p6 < /sup >  The [[African bullfrog]] is the only species where the males are longer than the females. < ref name=Sally/ > < sup > p6 < /sup >  Males can reach up to 9{{frac|1|2}}-10 inches in length, while the female only grows up to 4{{frac|1|2}} inches. Frogs belonging to the [[suborder]] [[Neobatrachia]], such as the [[poison dart frog]]s and [[Mantellinae]] frogs, can kill humans. Like most poisonous animals, they get their toxin from their food. < ref name=Sally/ > < sup > p8 < /sup > 
 
 == Habitats == 
 Most frogs and toads lives near slow moving waters like rivers, swamps, lakes and ponds. < ref name=B > Bartlett, Richard 2003. ''Poison dart frogs''. Barron. {{ISBN|0470165103}} < /ref > < sup > p22 < /sup >  Others such as [[tree frog]]s and [[poison dart frog]]s lives in [[forest]]s. Frogs and toads can be found almost everywhere except [[Antarctica]]. < ref name=B/ > < sup > p4 < /sup >  Frogs and toads [[wikt:squeak|squeak]] or make [[wikt:call|calls]] when they are touched or feel [[wikt:threaten|threatened]]. < ref name=B/ > < sup > p24 < /sup >  They also make those sounds to [[Communication|communicate]] with others in their [[habitat]]. They make these sounds by [[wikt:expand|expanding]] their [[throat]]s with air and [[wikt:deflate|letting the air go out]]. Male [[bullfrog]]s will [[roar (utterance)|roar]] while mating with a female. Most frogs and toads are [[territory|territorial]]. This means that they go to [[battle]] when an animal of their own kind gets close to where they live. They will jump, [[wikt:wrestle|wrestle]] and even chase any animal away. They do this to also attract females to their territory. Females  choose a territory where there is enough food for her to eat and if there is a lot of water to swim and lay her eggs. < ref name=S > Stebbins, Robert. 2003. ''Western reptiles  &  amphibians''. 3rd ed, Houghton Mifflin. < /ref > < sup > p223 < /sup > 
 
 Toads spend most of their time on land, while frogs spend most of their time in the water. < ref > Royston, Angela 2004. ''Living nature: Amphibians''. Black Rabbit. {{ISBN|1932333339}} < /ref > < sup > p6 < /sup >  [[Tailed frog]]s looks similar to toads because of their hard skin. A tailed frogs  " tail "  is really an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] they use to release [[sperm]] in fast-moving waters. They are the only frogs with this organ. < ref name=S/ > < sup > p199 < /sup >  The [[genus]] ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'' are terrestrial frogs. This means that they lay eggs on land. Spadefoot toads make crying sounds during a rainstorm. 
 
 == Species == 
 There are over 400 species of  " true "  toads, the Bufonidae. The [[marine toad]]s are the only toads which live in [[Australia]], where they were [[introduced species|introduced]] by people. True toads have poison [[parotoid gland]]s that can [[paralyze]] or even kill [[dog]]s. < ref name=S/ >  However, some other animals eat true toads without ill effects. Toad poisons are [[secretion|secreted]] by [[wart]]s. Touching them is not harmful to humans. < ref name=S/ > < sup > p202 < /sup > 
 
 There are over 400 species of tree frogs, many of which can change the color of their skin. < ref name=S/ > < sup > p220 < /sup >  Tree frogs have sticky feet, which helps them to climb and hang on to the big leaves.  " True frogs " , the [[Ranidae]], are found in every continent except [[Antarctica]]. The family has over 700 species. < ref name=S/ > < sup > p224 < /sup >   The feet of burrowing frogs feet help them to dig.
