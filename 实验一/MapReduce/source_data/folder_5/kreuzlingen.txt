 '''Kreuzlingen''' is a [[municipality]] in the district of [[Kreuzlingen (district)|Kreuzlingen]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Thurgau]] in [[Switzerland]].  
 
 It is the second largest city of the canton, after [[Frauenfeld]] with a population of over 18,000. 
 
 In 1874, the municipality of Egelshofen was renamed ''Kreuzlingen''. It reached the present size with the adding of Kurzrickenbach in 1927 and Emmishofen in 1928. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 It is located on [[Lake Constance]]. 
 
 It is halfway between [[Schaffhausen]] and [[Rorschach]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 {{complex|section|date=January 2012}} 
 The name of the municipality stems from the [[Augustinian]] monastery ''Crucelin'', which was later renamed [[Kreuzlingen Abbey]]. It was built in 1125 by the [[Bishop]] of Constance, Ulrich I. In the [[Swabian War]] and the [[30 Years' War]] after the [[siege]] of Constance by [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops, Kreuzlingen Abbey was burned down by the people of Constance. The [[crime]] was blamed on the monks for having supported the enemy. In 1650, the monastery was rebuilt in its present location. Because of [[secularism|secularization]] in 1848, the buildings became a school. The [[chapel]] became a [[Catholic]] church 
 
 People already lived in the Kreuzlingen area during the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] coins and artifacts show that people continued to be settled in the area pre-writing. Kurzrickenbach is first mentioned as ''Rihinbah'' in 830, Egelshofen is mentioned as ''Eigolteshoven'' in 1125, and Emmishofen is mentioned as ''Eminshoven'' in 1159. The territory of the municipality, except for the Augustinian monastery, belonged to the [[Bishop of Constance]].  
 
 Until the beginning of the 19th century, the current centre of Kreuzlingen was still largely [[agriculture|agricultural]]. The first [[steam engine|steamboats]] began to operate on Lake Constance in 1824. The first train line to [[Romanshorn]] was finished in 1871, and the second to [[Etzwilen]] in 1875. This brought [[commerce]] and [[industry]] to the area. In 1874, Kreuzlingen became the capital of the district, instead of the previous capital, [[Gottlieben]]. However, until [[World War I]], Kreuzlingen was a kind of suburb of Constance. Most of its profits went to German firms. The war made Kreuzlingen more independent. 
 
 [[w:The Sanatorium of Bellevue]] (1857-1980), which occupied part of the old monastery, played an important role in the history of Kreuzlingen. In 1842, a man called Ignaz Vanotti from Constance bought a large area of land and constructed a building to house the emigrant press of Bellevue in 1843, which had been in [[Römerburg]] before. In 1857, Ludwig Binswanger, a [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] from [[Münsterlingen]] bought the property and opened a private [[sanatorium]]. The clinic was very modern and stayed in the control of the Binswanger family for nearly 120 years. Important psychiatric discoveries, particularly under the founder's grandson's control, especially in the development of [[existential psychotherapy]], were made at the sanatorium. However, few of its buildings remain. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 Earlier, most of the people in Kreuzlingen made a living in the wine industry. However, because of diseases and bad harvests, the last wine grapes were raised in Kreuzlingen in 1938. 
 
 Today, the local economy is mostly shopping and [[handcraft]], with the largest employer being a clothing maker.
