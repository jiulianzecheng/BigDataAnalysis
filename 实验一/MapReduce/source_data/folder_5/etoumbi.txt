 '''Etoumbi''' is a [[town]] in a part of the [[Republic of the Congo]] called [[Cuvette-Ouest]]. 
 
 Recently, there were four [[outbreak]]s of the [[Ebola]] [[virus]] in Etoumbi. Some people think this is because the people that live there ate some dead animals from the forest. In [[2003]], 120 people died in an outbreak. Because of an outbreak in [[May]], [[2005]] nobody was allowed in or out of the town.
