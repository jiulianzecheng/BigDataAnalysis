 '''Thomism''' is a [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] school based on the ideas of [[Thomas Aquinas]], a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[theologian]] from the 1200s. His famous works include disputed questions and commentaries on [[Aristotle]] in philosophy, and the [[Summa Theologica]] in theology, which is very important in [[medieval]] theology and still guides the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church's]] [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]. 
 
 [[Pope Pius X]] in 1914 emphasized that understanding the Church's teachings requires knowing [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas's]] fundamental ideas. According to him, these ideas are like the solid base for understanding both [[Nature|natural]] and [[divine]] things. If these principles are ignored, it becomes hard for students to grasp the meanings of the Church's teachings. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2009-08-31|title=Doctoris Angelici|url=http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/doctoris.htm|access-date=2023-11-29|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2009-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831110620/http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/doctoris.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Thomas Aquinas]] believed in accepting truth from any source. He combined ideas from [[Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]] philosophers. He was a realist, meaning he thought the [[world]] could be known as it is. < ref > {{Cite web|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The mode and order of understanding (Prima Pars, Q. 85)|url=https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1085.htm#article2|access-date=2023-11-29|website=www.newadvent.org}} < /ref >  [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas]] often supported [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] views and used Aristotle's terms and ideas. He also followed some [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] principles, such as the belief in God as the essential being and everything being good by participating in this essential goodness. < ref > {{Cite web|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: How the soul while united to the body understands corporeal things beneath it (Prima Pars, Q. 84)|url=https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1084.htm#article7|access-date=2023-11-29|website=www.newadvent.org}} < /ref > 
 
 == History and Impact == 
 [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] changed the direction of [[Scholasticism]], moving it from [[neoplatonism]] to [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ideas. This shift had a big impact on [[Catholicism]] and the ethics of the Catholic school, making it one of the most influential philosophies ever. Many people follow its teachings. < ref > {{Cite book|title=On the History of Political Philosophy: Great Political Thinkers from Thucydides to Lockep|last=W Julian Korab-Karpowicz|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317346012|pages=95}} < /ref > 
 
 However, during Aquinas' time, some of his ideas were banned in [[Paris]] by [[Stephen Tempier|Bishop Stephen Tempier]], and some were condemned by ecclesiastical authorities in 1277. The Franciscan Order opposed Aquinas, while the Dominicans defended his work. Early critics included William de la Mare, Henry of Ghent, Giles of Rome, and Jon Duns Scotus. On the other hand, defenders included [[Albertus Magnus]], Richard Knapwell, William Macclesfeld, Giles of Lessines, John of Quidort, Bernard of Auvergne, and Thomas of Sutton. < ref > {{Cite book|title=A short history of Thomism|last=Cessario|first=Romanus|date=2005|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1386-6|location=Washington, D.

 [[Aquinas]] was canonized in 1323, and the condemnation of 1277 was revoked. Later, Thomism faced challenges from the via moderna, especially from [[William of Ockham]] and followers. [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] theologians mainly held on to Thomism, and it gained strength in the 16th century in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with figures like [[Francisco de Vitoria]], Domingo de Soto, John of St. Thomas, Domingo Báñez, and others. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Church triumphant: a history of Christianity up to 1300|last=Hinson|first=E.

 In the modern period, [[Pope Leo XIII]] tried to revive Thomism with the encyclical Aeterni Patris in 1879. This led to Neothomism, which emphasized the ethical aspects of Thomism. It dominated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] until the Second Vatican Council. Thomism is still an influential philosophy in [[Catholicism]] today, although the Church does not favor one philosophy over others. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2013-12-24|title=Looking Back at  " Humani Generis " |url=https://www.hprweb.com/2013/12/looking-back-at-humani-generis/|access-date=2023-11-29|website=Homiletic  &  Pastoral Review|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 In recent times, the cognitive neuroscientist Walter Freeman suggests that Thomism is a philosophical system that aligns well with the understanding of cognition in [[neuroscience]]. < ref > In his 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' entitled  " Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas.
