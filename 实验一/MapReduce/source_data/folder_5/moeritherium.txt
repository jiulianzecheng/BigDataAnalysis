 '''''Moeritherium''''' is a extinct [[genus]] of primitive [[mammal]]s. It represents a very early stage in the evolution of [[elephant]]s.  These prehistoric mammals are related to the elephant and, more distantly, the [[Manatee|sea cow]]. They lived during the later [[Eocene]] in what is now [[North Africa]]. 
 
 ''Moeritherium'' did not look like living elephants. It was about as large as a [[tapir]]. It had short, strong legs, a relatively long body, and a short tail. The feet of ''Moeritherium'' were broad and had flat-hoofed toes.
