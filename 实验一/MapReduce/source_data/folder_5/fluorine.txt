 '''Fluorine''' (symbol '''F''') is a [[chemical element]] that is very poisonous. Its [[atomic number]] (which is the number of [[proton]]s in it) is 9, and its [[atomic mass]] is 19. It is part of the Group 7 ([[halogen]]s) on the [[periodic table]] of elements. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 Fluorine is a light yellow diatomic gas. It is very reactive gas, which exists as diatomic molecules. It is the most reactive element. Fluorine has a very high attraction for electrons because it is missing one. This makes it the most powerful [[oxidizing agent]]. It can rip electrons from water (making [[oxygen]]) and ignite [[propane]] on contact. It does not need a spark. Metals can catch on fire when placed in a stream of fluorine. After it is [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] by reacting with other things, it forms the stable [[fluoride]] ion. Fluorine is very poisonous. Fluorine bonds very strongly with [[carbon]]. It can react with the unreactive [[noble gas]]es. It explodes when mixed with [[hydrogen]]. The melting point of fluorine is -363.33째F (-219.62째C), the boiling point is -306.62째F (-188.12째C).

 ==Occurrence== 
 [[File:Fluorite crystals 270x444.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Fluorite]] [[crystal]]s, the  " ore "  of fluorine]] 
 Fluorine is not found as an element on the earth becase it is too reactive. Several fluorides are found in the earth, though. When [[calcium phosphate]] is reacted with [[sulfuric acid]] to make [[phosphoric acid]], some [[hydrofluoric acid]] is produced. Also, [[fluorite]] can be reacted with sulfuric acid to make hydrofluoric acid. Fluorite naturally occurs on the earths' crust in rocks, coal and clay. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 Fluorine is normally made by [[electrolysis]]. [[Hydrogen fluoride]] is dissolved in [[potassium fluoride]]. This mixture is melted and an electric current is passed through it. This is electrolysis. Hydrogen is produced at one side and fluorine at the other side. If the sides are not separated, the cell may explode. 
 
 Someone made fluorine in 1986 without using electrolysis. They produced [[manganese(IV) fluoride]] by using various chemical compounds, which released fluorine gas. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Fluorine is used to enrich uranium for [[nuclear weapon]]s. It is also used to make [[sulfur hexafluoride]]. Sulfur hexafluoride is used to propel stuff out of an aerosol can. It is also used to make [[integrated circuit]]s. Fluorine compounds have many uses. [[Fluoride]] ions are in fluorine compounds. Fluoride ions can be in [[toothpaste]]. Some are used in [[wikt:nonstick|nonstick]] coatings. [[Freon]]s contain fluorine. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 Fluorine as an element is extremely reactive and toxic. It can react with almost everything, even glass. Fluorine is also poisonous. 
 
 Fluoride ions are somewhat toxic. If too much toothpaste containing fluoride is eaten then fluoride poisoning may occur. Fluoride is not reactive, though.
