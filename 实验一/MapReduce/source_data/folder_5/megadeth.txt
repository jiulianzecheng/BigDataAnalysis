Their first album with Capitol Records, ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'', was released in 1986. In the 1980s, many members of Megadeth were [[Drug addiction|addicted to drugs]]. Band members also had problems with each other. Because of this, they had bad [[News|publicity]]. The band has released many popular albums, such as ''[[So Far, So Good...

 On April 11, 1983, [[Metallica]] fired Dave Mustaine before they released their first album, ''[[Kill 'Em All]]''. This was because he was [[Drug addiction|addicted to drugs]]. He also had problems with [[James Hetfield]] and [[Lars Ulrich]]. Mustaine was one of the first members of Metallica. He made some of the band's first songs. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC|title=Guitar Gods: The 25 Players who Made Rock History|last=Gulla|first=Bob|date=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35806-7|language=en}} < /ref >  After he was fired, Mustaine wanted to make a band that had faster, better music than Metallica. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC|title=Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal|last=Wagner|first=Jeff|date=2010|publisher=Bazillion Points Books|isbn=978-0-9796163-3-4|language=en}} < /ref >  While he was riding a bus to [[Los Angeles]], Mustaine read an [[Advertising|advertisement]] by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Alan Cranston]] that had the word  " megadeath "  in it. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/isbn_9780061714375|title=Mustaine : a heavy metal memoir|last1=Mustaine|first1=Dave|last2=Layden|first2=Joe|date=2010|publisher=New York : It Books|others=Internet Archive|isbn=978-0-06-171437-5}} < /ref >  He liked the word, and wrote a song named  " Megadeth " . 
 
 When he got to Los Angeles, Mustaine wanted to make a band. He looked for [[Musician|musicians]] for it. Bassist [[David Ellefson]] and guitarist Greg Handevidt joined the band. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  He named the band Fallen Angels. He changed the name to Megadeth later. 
 
 Handevidt only stayed in the band for a few months. Mustaine and Ellefson worked well together. Mustaine had trouble finding other people to join Megadeth. Many drummers [[Audition|auditioned]] to join the band during this time. The band wanted a drummer they could work well with. [[Lee Rausch]] joined the band to play the drums. For six months, they tried to find someone that wanted to be the band's singer. Mustaine became the singer so they could start making music. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60Jde3l7WNwC|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|last1=Prown|first1=Pete|last2=Newquist|first2=Harvey P.|date=1997|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-7935-4042-6|language=en}} < /ref >  A few singers were in Megadeth before this.

 In 1984, Megadeth made three songs. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite web|title=MEGADETH – Love It To Death (MF12, 1985) {{!}} Features / Interviews @ Metal Forces Magazine|url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-megadeth-mf12/|access-date=2022-09-24}} < /ref >  The songs were put in a [[Demo (music)|demo]] named ''Last Rites.''

It had songs such as  " [[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!|Last Rites/Loved to Death]] "  and  " [[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!|Mechanix]] " . These were later on the band's first album.  
 
 Megadeth could not find a second guitarist that worked well with the band. [[Kerry King]] from [[Slayer]] played guitar for some of the band's [[Concert|concerts]] in [[San Francisco]] in early 1984. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  After the concerts, King went back to playing with Slayer. Megadeth replaced Lee Rausch with [[jazz]] drummer [[Gar Samuelson]] in October 1984. Before joining Megadeth, Samuelson was in a jazz band with a guitarist named [[Chris Poland]]. Poland watched Samuelson playing with Megadeth and told Mustaine he wanted to play with the band as well. He joined Megadeth in December 1984. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Megadeth joined [[Combat Records]] after they offered to give the band a lot of money to record music and play at concerts. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  In 1985, Combat Records gave Megadeth $8,000 to make their first [[album]].

 ''[[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!]]'' was released in 1985. Many people who listened to [[Heavy metal music|metal]] liked the album.

 The album was made with $25,000 given to the band by Combat Records. Megadeth wanted more money, so they left Combat and joined [[Capitol Records]]. Capitol bought the [[Copyright|rights]] to sell the album and hired [[producer]] Paul Lani to make the band's recordings sound better. ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'' was released in late 1986.

 === 1988–1989: ''So Far, So Good... So What!'' === 
 Capitol Records gave Megadeth a large amount of money to make more music. The band started making an album named ''[[So Far, So Good... So What!]].'' It took almost half a year to record. There were many problems while making the album, such as Mustaine's [[Substance abuse|drug addiction]]. Mustaine had arguments with the album's [[Record producer|producer]], Paul Lani. This was because Lani wanted Behler to record his drums and his [[Cymbal|cymbals]] at different times. < ref > ''So Far, So Good... So What! (2004 reissue)'' (liner notes).

 ''So Far, So Good... So What!'' was released in January 1988.

After the album came out, Megadeth went on a world tour that lasted almost eight months. After, they had a North American tour with [[Warlock (band)|Warlock]] and [[Sanctuary (band)|Sanctuary]] and a European tour with other thrash metal bands. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Megadeth|url=http://www.metallipromo.com/meg.html|access-date=2022-09-24|website=www.metallipromo.com}} < /ref > 
 
 In August 1988, Megadeth was at the Monsters of Rock festival in the United Kingdom. They played music for over 100,000 people there. For one show, Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] played with the band. Megadeth went on the Monsters of Rock European concert tour. They stopped playing after the first concert because of Ellefson's drug addiction. < ref name= " lifewdeth " / >  Ellefson was treated for his issues, and [[Testament (band)|Testament]] replaced Megadeth for the rest of the tour. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=2009-12-20|title=Ex-MEGADETH Guitarist JEFF YOUNG Responds To DAVE MUSTAINE's Drug Allegations|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ex-megadeth-guitarist-jeff-young-responds-to-dave-mustaine-s-drug-allegations/|access-date=2022-09-24|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 After the band played at Monsters of Rock, Mustaine fired Behler and Young. He also canceled the band's Australian tour.

 The band could not find someone to replace Young quickly. 1989 was the first year since Megadeth was made that the band did not play at a concert.
