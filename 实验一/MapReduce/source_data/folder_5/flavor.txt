'''Flavor''' (or '''flavour''' in [[British English]]) is the main [[quality]] of anything which affects the [[taste]]. When someone remarks on the ''flavor'' of something they are trying to describe the specific way something tastes. 
 
 Flavor can also be used to describe the act of adding a taste alteration (to change the taste) to something. This is usually done by adding [[spice]]s or [[sugar]]s, though in ''processed food'' there are oftentimes artificial (fake) flavors. A person who develops natural and/or artificial food [[additive|additives]] is called a [[flavorist|flavourist]] or flavorist ([[US English]]).
