 '''Pterygota''' is a [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of [[insect]]s that includes the [[wing]]ed insects. It also includes insect orders that are secondarily wingless. That means insect groups whose [[ancestor]]s once had wings but that have lost them later in [[evolution]]. 
 
 The Pterygota today includes almost all insects. That is because [[flying]] led to a great [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] of insect types. The groups without flight are in the [[Apterygota]]. 
 
 In the Pterygota, are the [[Palaeoptera]] and the [[Neoptera]]. The Palaeoptera is [[paraphyletic]], and its classification is being discussed. Likewise the [[Exopterygota]]. There are no agreed alternatives at present, so the taxonomy is left in its traditional form. 
 
 The [[Endopterygota]] is made up of all the insects which have [[complete metamorphosis]]. It is agreed to be a good [[monophyletic]] [[clade]], even though some of the details may need to be adjusted.
