 '''Mali''' ([[Bambara language|Bambara]]:  ߡߊߟߌ, [[Fula language|Fula]]: 𞤃𞤢𞥄𞤤𞤭, {{lang-ar|مالي}}), officially the '''Republic of Mali''' ({{lang-fr|République du Mali}}; [[Bambara language|Bambara]]: ߡߊߟߌ ߞߊ ߝߊߛߏߖߊߡߊߣߊ); [[Fula language|Fula]]: 𞤈𞤫𞤲𞥆𞤣𞤢𞥄𞤲𞤣𞤭 𞤃𞤢𞥄𞤤𞤭, {{lang-ar|جمهورية مالي}}) is a [[landlocked]] [[country]] (a country entirely surrounded by [[land]]) in [[West Africa]]. Mali is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the [[north]], [[Niger]] on the [[east]], [[Burkina Faso]] and the [[Côte d'Ivoire]] on the [[south]], [[Guinea]] on the south-west, and [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]] on the [[west]]. Physical features of Mali include the [[Sahara]] [[desert]] in the north, with the [[Niger River]] and [[Sénégal River]] in the southern part of the country. As of a July 2021 [[wikt:estimate|estimate]], Mali has a [[population]] of approximately {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Mali}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people.{{UN_Population|ref}} Mali has a total [[area]] of {{convert|1,220,190|km2|mi2}}. Most of the people live in the southern part of the country. Mali's [[Capital (city)|capital]] and most populated [[city]] is [[Bamako]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The [[Mandé]] people founded several [[kingdom]]s in the [[Sahel]]. This was a big area that included Mali. These kingdoms included the [[Ghana Empire]], the [[Mali Empire]], and the [[Songhai Empire]]. [[Timbuktu]] was an important city in these [[empire]]s because a lot of [[Trans-Saharan trade|trade across the Sahara Desert]] went there. Timbuktu was also a good place for learning. The Songhai Empire became much smaller after a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] attack in 1591. 
 
 [[France]] invaded Mali in 1880. After that, France owned Mali. France gave Mali the names ''French Sudan'' and the ''Sudanese Republic''. At some times it also included other nearby countries. In early 1959, Mali and Senegal united and they became the [[Mali Federation]]. They became independent from France on June 20, 1960. Senegal left the Mali Federation a few months later. The '''Republic of Mali''', with [[Modibo Keïta]] as the first [[List of heads of state of Mali|president]], left the [[French Community]] on September 22, 1960. 
 
 There was a [[coup]] in Mali in 1968. Modibo Keïta lost his job and was put in prison. Mali was then ruled by [[Moussa Traoré]] until 1991. He treated the country badly, and so there was another coup in 1991 after protests against the government, and a [[Constitution of Mali|new constitution]] was made.  The leader of the country was then [[Amadou Toumani Touré]].   
 
 In 1992, [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]] won Mali's first democratic [[election]].  President Konaré won again in 1997 and he made big political and economic changes.  In 2002, Amadou Toumani Touré won the election and he started his second term as head of state.  He was a retired general and was the military leader of the 1991 coup.  Today, Mali is one of the least stable countries in Africa. 
 
 ==Regions and cercles== 
 {{update|date=May 2023|reason=The number of cercles, arrondissements, and communes is probably wrong and needs better sources.}}

 ==Geography== 
 [[File:Mali carte.png|thumbnail|right|250px|Map of Mali]] 
 Mali is the world's 24th-largest country. The area of the country is 1,240,000 [[square kilometre|km²]] (478,734 [[square mile|mi²]]). Mali and [[South Africa]] are about the same size. It is two times bigger than [[Texas]]. 
 
 Most of Mali is part of the [[Sahara Desert]]. Mali is does not have any sea coast. It is landlocked.  Mali does not have many mountains. Flat areas in the north are covered by [[sand]]. [[Savanna]] is around the [[Niger River]] in the south. The climate is dry. The dry season is hot and dusty. There are many natural resources in Mali, including [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[phosphate]]s, [[kaolinite]], [[salt]], and [[limestone]]. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 [[File:Kati market street (and Amadu).jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|Market scene in [[Kati]]]] 
 Mali is one of the poorest countries in the [[world]]. 65% of its land area is [[desert]] or something similar. There have been several long droughts over the last hundred years. Therefore, most economic activity is near the Niger River.  
 
 About 10% of the people are [[nomad]]s and 80% of workers have jobs in [[farming]] and [[fishing]]. [[Industry]] is mainly to process farm products. Women also do [[pottery]] and the pots are bought and taken to [[market]]s. Many foreign [[tourism|tourists]] like the traditional methods which the women use to make the pots.  
 
 Mali's main [[export]] is [[cotton]], so if the price of cotton changes, Mali's economy is affected a lot. Mali also receives a lot of financial help from other countries.  
 
 In 1997, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) recommended a programme for changing the economy and the government followed this. Several international companies started exploring for larger amounts of gold in 1996-1998, and the Malian government thinks that Mali will become an important gold [[export]]er soon. 
 
 ==Demographics== 
 [[File:Mali-demography.png|thumbnail|250px|Population changes in Mali]] 
 There are several ethnic and religious groups in Mali. 
 * [[Mandé]] (Bambara, Malinke, Soninke): 50% 
 * [[Peul]] (Fula/Fulani): 17% 
 * [[Voltaic]]: 12% 
 * [[Songhai]]: 6% 
 * [[Tuareg]] and [[Moor people|Moor]]: 10% 
 * Others: 5% 
 
 These [[religion]]s are common in Mali. 
 * [[Islam]]: 90% 
 * Traditional Mali Beliefs: 9% 
 * [[Christianity]]: 1% 
 
 ==Culture== 
 [[File:The new mosque in mali atamari.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|[[Mosque]] being built in [[Bamako]]]] 
 About 90% of people from Mali follow [[Sunni Islam]], but they do not always forget their traditional religions. [[Islam|Muslims]] have their own schooling system. The number of Muslims from Mali who go to [[Mecca]] is increasing and some study in [[Arab]] countries. About 1% of the people are [[Christianity|Christians]]. When Mali was under French control, Christian teachers were sent to Islamic areas. 
 
 The [[language]] of Mali under French rule was [[French language|French]], but now not many people outside towns can read or write this language. However, about 60% of the people use other languages well. Many people can read and write in [[Bamanakan]] (the most popular spoken language). This language has its own alphabet, called [[N'Ko]]. Other people can read and write in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], after going to an Islamic school. One of the oldest universities in the world is Sankore University in [[Timbuktu]].  It began in the [[1400s]]. 
 
 Famous musicians from Mali include [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] player [[Toumani Diabaté]], and the [[guitarist]] [[Ali Farka Touré]], who has died.
