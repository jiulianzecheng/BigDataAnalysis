In [[computer science]], '''runtime''' or '''run time''' describes the operation of a [[computer program]], the duration of its execution, from beginning to termination. 
 
 The [[Technical terminology|term]] '''runtime''' can also refer to a [[virtual machine]] to manage a program written in a [[computer language]] while it is running. 
 
 '''Run time''' is sometimes used to mean  [[runtime library]], a library of basic code that is used by a particular [[compiler]] but when used in this fashion, '''runtime library''' is more accurate. 
 
 A '''runtime environment''' is a [[virtual machine state]] which provides software services for [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[computer program|programs]] while a computer is running. 
 
 Runtime activities include [[Loader (computing)|loading]] and [[Linker|linking]] of the classes needed to execute a program, optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of the program, and actual [[Execution (computing)|program execution]]. 
 
 For example, a program written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] calls for services from the [[Java Runtime Environment]] by issuing commands from which the expected result is returned by the Java Runtime. By providing these services, the [[Java Runtime Environment]] is considered the runtime environment of the program. Both the program and the [[Java Runtime Environment]] request services from the operating system. The operating system kernel provides services for itself and all processes and software running under its control. The Operating System may be considered as providing a runtime environment for itself.
