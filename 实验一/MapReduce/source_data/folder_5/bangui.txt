 '''Bangui''' is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Central African Republic]]. It is the largest [[city]] in the [[country]]. The city has a [[population]] of 531,763 people. Most of the population of the Central African Republic lives in the western parts of the country, near Bangui. 
 
 == History == 
 The city was [[:wikt:found|founded]] in [[1889]] in what was then the [[France|French]] [[colony]] [[Haut-Oubangui]] ('Upper Ubangi'). The colony was later renamed Oubangui-Chari and made part of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. The city grew around the French [[military]] post on the [[Ubangi]] river. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/africa/centralafricanrepublic/bangui |title=World66 - Bangui travel guide |access-date=2007-06-09 |archive-date=2013-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231002344/http://www.world66.com/africa/centralafricanrepublic/bangui |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Bangui served as an [[administration]] center for the colony and is now the administrative center of the CAR. 
 
 Much [[violence]] in Bangui came after the March [[1981]] [[election]]s. These elections took place after the French removed [[Jean-Bedel Bokassa]] from office and replaced him with [[David Dacko]]. People who did not like Dacko [[wikt:attack|attacked]] Bangui and made Dacko leave the country. [[Andre Kolingba]] then formed the [[Comité Militaire pour le Redressement National]]. 
 
 About 200 Central African Republic [[soldier]]s [[mutiny|mutinied]] in Bangui in May 1996. They wanted back [[wage|pay]] and for dictator [[Patassé]] to be removed from control of the country.  French soldiers in the country stopped them and returned Patassé to power.  More than 50 people were [[kill]]ed during this time. 
 
 == Geography and Climate == 
 Bangui is on the northern banks of the [[Ubangi River]]. It is just below a series of [[rapids]]. The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] town of [[Zongo]] is on the opposite side of the river from Bangui. The city centre is near the river. It has a large [[triumphal arch]], the Presidential Palace and the central [[market]]. North of the city lie rolling [[hills]]. 
 
 The Central African Republic is just north of the [[Equator]]. Because of this, the daily high [[temperature]]s rarely fall below the high 80s [[Fahrenheit]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT004980 |title=BBC - World Weather - Average Conditions - Central African Republic |access-date=2007-06-09 |archive-date=2007-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021085309/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT004980 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The [[rain]]y season lasts from May until October.
