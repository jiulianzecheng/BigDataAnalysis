 A '''swamp''' is a type of [[wetland]] [[ecosystem]]. Swamps are forested, low, spongy land generally saturated with water and covered with trees and aquatic plants. < ref > [http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/fringe/glossary.html Swamp] (from glossary webpage of the [[United States Geological Survey]]) < /ref >  Big parts of swamps are often flooded with water. Swamps are nesting and [[breeding]] grounds for [[bird]]s and other [[animal]]s. 
 
 The water of a swamp may be [[fresh water]], [[brackish water]], or [[seawater]]. [[Freshwater]] swamps form along large rivers or lakes. < ref name= " Hughes, F.M.R. 2003 " > Hughes, F.M.R. (ed.). 2003. The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests. FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 96 p. < /ref >  [[Saltwater]] swamps are found along tropical and subtropical coastlines.   
 
 About 6 percent of Earth's surface is covered by swamps. Swamps are also [[filter]]s for [[groundwater]], and protect against [[flooding]]. Swamps are one of the key wetland areas which are protected by the international agency [[Ramsar]]. 
 
 Some well-known swamps are:  
 * The [[Pantanal]] is the world's biggest wetland. It covers an area of 140,000 square kilometers, bigger than the area covered by the country [[Greece]]. The Panatal is in [[South America]]. It is shared by [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]]. < ref > {{cite web|url = http://www.ramsar.org/wwd/7/wwd2007_rpts_germany_gnf.htm|title = Pantanal in South America declared  " Threatened Lake of the Year 2007 " |publisher = Ramsar Convention Secretariat|date = February 2007|accessdate = 2008-10-24}} < /ref > 
 * The [[Everglades]] 
 * The [[Okefenokee]] 
 * The [[Sundarbans]] 
 
 [[Peat]] accumulates in these swamps. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and the [[Congo River|Congo]]. < ref > Keddy, P.A., L.H.
