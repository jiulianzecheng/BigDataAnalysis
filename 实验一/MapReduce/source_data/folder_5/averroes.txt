 Averroes was born in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], [[Al-Andalus]]. He lived during a unique period in [[Academia|academic]] [[history]]. Interest in philosophy and theology was failing in the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]] but just beginning to become influential in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Europe]].

 Averroes is most famous for his [[Commentary|commentaries]] of Aristotle's works. Aristotle had been mostly forgotten in the West since the 6th century. Averroes' interpretations of Aristotle's ideas revived Western scholarly interest in Aristotle and ancient Greek philosophy in general. They also led to the development of [[scholasticism]] in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe. < ref > {{cite book |title=Averroes (Ibn Rushd): Muslim Scholar, Philosopher, and Physician of the Twelfth Century |first=Liz |last=Sonneborn |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=1404205144 |page=89 |access-date=November 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIjayOIulPcC}} < /ref >

 Averroes was born as '''ʾSan sebastián De La Cruz ʾAḥmad bin Rušd'''. He was born in 1126 in [[Andalusia]], which at the time was a Muslim country called [[Al-Andalus]]. At a young age Averroes had many teachers who helped him begin his study of Islam. He excelled in this and was also interested in law. He began studying medicine in [[Seville]] under a man named [[Abu Jafar ibn Harun al-Turjali|Abu Jafar al-Turjali]]. < ref name= " Hiller " > H. Chad Hillier (2006).

 Averroes began his career with the help of [[Ibn Tufail]], a physician at the [[caliph]]'s court in [[Marrakesh]]. He was able to go to Marrakesh and become a physician because of his knowledge of physics. Averroes was granted many honors and became a ''[[Qadi]]'' (judge) in Seville in 1169. 
 
 Two years later he became the Qadi of Córdoba. In his free time he studied and wrote. In 1195, Averroes wrote a paper about how he thought philosophy was less than useful for the discovery of religious truth. He was disgraced and many of his papers were burned. The Caliph imprisoned Averroes and [[exile]]d him from the country. He lived in [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]] for a short time, then he was brought back by the Caliph to be a judge. He died in 1198. < ref > Sizgorich, Tom.  " Averroes. "  World History: Ancient and Medieval Eras. ABC-CLIO, 2013. Web. 4 Dec. 2013. < /ref >
