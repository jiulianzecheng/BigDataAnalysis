 The '''Palaeocene''' is the first [[geology|geological]] epoch in the [[Palaeogene]]. It was from 66 to 56 million years ago. It started after the end of the [[Cretaceous]], and it was followed by the [[Eocene]] epoch. 
 
 The word  " Palaeocene "  may be spelled  " Paleocene "  quite correctly. It is just an alternative spelling.  
 
 The Palaeocene began and ended with an [[extinction]] event, each of quite a different character. The epoch began with the [[K/T extinction event]], caused by a combination of a meteorite strike ([[Chicxulub crater]]) and a huge volcanic flood basalt eruption. The eruption produced the [[Deccan Plateau#The Deccan Traps|Deccan Traps]] in what is now [[India]]. This would have caused the extinction of many groups.  
 
 The epoch ended with the ''Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum'', a [[deep ocean anoxic event]] (DOAE). This means that the ocean depths were lacking [[oxygen]], so no higher forms of life could survive there. This produced a mass extinction of between 35–50% of deep water forms such as benthic [[foraminifera]]. At the same time there was a major change of mammalian types on land. 
 
 == Climate == 
 After a cooler start, the climate grew warmer during the epoch, far warmer than today, and the world was heavily forested. There were no ice caps at the poles. Warm seas circulated throughout the world, including the poles. The earliest Paleocene featured a low diversity and abundance of marine life, but this trend reversed later in the epoch. < ref name=Hooker > Hooker J.J. 2005. Tertiary to Present: Paleocene. In Selley, Richard C; L. Robin McCocks and Ian R. Plimer (eds) ''Encyclopedia of Geology''. Oxford: Elsevier. vol. 5, 459-465. {{ISBN|0-12-636380-3}} < /ref >  Tropical conditions gave rise to abundant marine life, including [[coral reef]]s. With the extinction of marine reptiles at the end of the Cretaceous, [[shark]]s became the top predators. At the end of the Cretaceous, the [[ammonite]]s and many species of [[foraminifera]] became extinct. 
 
 Marine faunas also came to look like modern faunas. Only the marine mammals and an important family of sharks, the [[Carcharhinidae]], are missing. 
 
 Non-avian dinosaurs may have survived to some extent into the early Danian stage of the Paleocene Epoch about 66 mya. The controversial evidence for such is a [[hadrosaur]] leg bone found from Paleocene strata in [[New Mexico]]; < ref name= " Fassett " > {{cite journal|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/impact2000/pdf/3139.pdf|title=Compelling new evidence for Paleocene dinosaurs in the Ojo Alamo Sandstone, San Juan Basin, New Mexico and Colorado, USA|author=Fassett, JE, Lucas, SG, Zielinski, RA, and Budahn, JR|year=2001|journal=Catastrophic Events and Mass Extinctions, Lunar and Planetary Contribution|volume=1053|pages=45–46|bibcode=2001caev.conf.3139F|accessdate=2007-05-18}} < /ref >  but such stray late forms may be derived fossils. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=RM|title=No Paleocene dinosaurs in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003RM/finalprogram/abstract_47695.htm|journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|volume=35|issue=5|pages=15|year=2003|accessdate=2007-07-02|archive-date=2011-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408155457/http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003RM/finalprogram/abstract_47695.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This means they were fossilised, then [[erosion]] uncovered them, then they were buried again in a younger layer of rocks. 
 
 == Polar forests == 
 The warm Paleocene climate, much like that of the Cretaceous, supported  polar forests. Rainfall is a major factor in plant diversity nearer the equator, but polar plants have to adapt to light ([[polar night]]s and [[midnight sun]]s) and temperature. Because of this, plants from both poles evolved some similar characteristics, such as broad leaves. Plant diversity at both poles increased throughout the Paleocene, especially at the end, with the increasing global temperature. < ref name=askin1995 > {{cite book|first1=R. A.|last1=Askin|first2=R.
