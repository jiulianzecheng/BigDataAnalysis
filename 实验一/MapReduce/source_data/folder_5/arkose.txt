 Arkose is generally formed from the [[weathering]] of [[igneous]] or [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks. These are usually [[granite]] rocks, which contain a lot of feldspar and quartz. Arkose is often found with [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] deposits where the sediment is made of [[granite]]. The  central [[Australian]] monolith [[Uluru]] is made of late [[Neoproterozoic]]/[[Cambrian]] arkose, deposited by the [[erosion]] of a granite-based mountain range. < ref name=Sweet1992 > {{cite book| author = Sweet I.P.  &  Crick I.H.| year = 1991| title = {{unicode|Uluṟu  &  Kata Tjuṯa}}: A geological history| publisher = Australian Geological Survey Organization| isbn = 0-644-25681-8| url =}} < /ref >
