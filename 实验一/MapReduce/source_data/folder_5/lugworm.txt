 The '''lugworm''' (''Arenicola marina''), also known as the '''sandworm''', is a large [[ocean|marine]] worm of the [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] [[Annelida]]. Lugworms make the coiled tubes of sand that are a familiar sight on a beach at low tide. The lugworm itself is not seen except by people who dig them up from curiosity or to use as fishing bait. 
 
 The lugworm lives in a U-shaped tube in the sand, and [[filter feeder|filters]] out its food from the water. 
 
 Arenicola marina can grow to about 5 inches long (13 cm). Its body is [[wikt:segmented|segmented]], like that of an [[earthworm]]. It has bristles in the middle of its body. It is a [[polychaeta|polychaete]]. It also has well-developed [[blood]]-vessels, and [[gill]]s to breathe in the water.  
 
 Although the textbook example is usually ''Arenicola marina'', there is a second species, ''Arenicola defodiens'', which lives a similar life. It grows to about 9 inches long (23 cm)
