 '''Guam''' ({{lang-ch|Guåhan}}) is an [[island]] in [[Micronesia]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and is a [[U.S. territory]]. < ref > More exactly, it is an ''unincorporated'' territory. < /ref >  This means that it is part of the [[United States]] and [[citizen]]s of Guam are [[Citizenship in the United States|citizens of the United States]] as well. Guam is not an [[Independence|independent]] country, but like all populated U.S. territories, it enjoys a greater degree of [[autonomy]] than [[U.S. states]]. The [[Chamorro people]] are the native people from Guam. The [[capital city]] of Guam is the city of [[Hagåtña]] and the largest city is [[Dededo]]. Guam has important [[United States Air Force]] and [[Naval]] bases, which occupy a major part of Guam's land area. Guam is also a popular [[tourist]] destination. 
 
 Guam is one of two U.S. territories where the [[metric system]] is officially used and is dominant. (The other is [[Puerto Rico]], which was also a Spanish colony. The metric system was introduced to both territories, before they became U.S. territories.) < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|title=US leaves the world puzzled by dragging its feet on metric system|url=https://www.nationthailand.com/perspective/30275741|date=2015-12-26|access-date=2023-01-28|website=The Nation Thailand}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 Guam was one of the first islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] to be visited by the Europeans. In 1521, while leading the Spanish expedition, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] became one of the first Europeans to set foot on Guam. From then on, Guam became an important part of the trade route followed by the Spanish trading ships called [[Manila Galleon]], which sailed between [[Mexico]] and the [[Philippines]] every year. And in 1668, [[Spain]] took over Guam as one of its territories. During this time, the natives assimilated the Spanish culture to a large extent. 
 
 In the 1898, [[Spanish–American War]], [[Spain]] lost most of its territories to the [[United States]] under the Treaty of Paris, including Guam, [[Cuba]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]].  Guam continued to be important due to its strategic location for shipping, and later for air travel in the Pacific.  During [[World War II]], Japan occupied Guam in 1941 for 31 months, but lost the territory to the [[United States]] soon after.  The [[Chamorro people]] are spread across Guam and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]- which is also a [[United States]] territory. However, the [[Chamorro people]] from [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have not integrated well into the territory as they were under Japanese occupation for about 30 years. 
 
 In 1950, the [[United States]] Congress passed a law to incorporate the people of Guam as American citizens. 
 
 In August 2017, [[North Korea]] warned that it might launch mid-range [[ballistic missile]]s into waters within 18 to 24 miles (29 to 38 kilometers) of Guam, following an [[North Korea–United States relations#Trump administration|exchange of threats]] < ref > {{cite news|last=Horton|first=Alex|date=August 9, 2017|title=Why North Korea threatened Guam, the tiny U.S. territory with big military power|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/08/09/why-north-korea-threatened-guam-the-tiny-u-s-territory-with-big-military-power/|df=mdy-all}} < /ref > < ref name=cnbc-20170810 > {{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/10/north-koreas-missile-threat-to-guam-crafted-for-maximum-drama.html |title=North Korea's missile threat to Guam crafted for 'maximum drama,' says former CIA analyst |last=Daniels |first=Jeff |publisher=CNBC News |date=10 August 2017 |accessdate=11 August 2017}} < /ref >  between the governments of North Korea and the [[Trump administration|United States]]. 
 
 == Money == 
 The [[currency]] of Guam is the [[United States dollar]]. Guam gets most of its [[money]] from the [[United States government]]. Much of that money is spent on the military bases, but there are also [[federal grant]]s given to the Guam government for various programs. Because it is only a territory, federal [[income tax]]es paid by Guam residents are given to the Guam government for its operations. 
 
 Guam is a sought after travel destination. Almost all of these visitors are from Japan. Japanese tourists like Guam because it is closer to Japan than other American places. Guam has lots of hotels and other fun places for people to visit. Tumon Bay is Guam's biggest [[beach]]. It has lots of pretty white sand, and the water has lots of fish. Tumon is becoming a busy city. 
 
 The number of visitors to Guam has decreased significantly mainly because of economic slowdown in most parts of Asia, which is also the cause for [[unemployment|lost jobs]] in Guam. 
 
 == Land and water == 
 Guam is 212 square [[mile]]s (549 [[square kilometre|square kilometers]]) large. In the north part, it has a flat area of [[coral]] and [[limestone]] rock. The south part has mountains. Around the island is a [[coral reef]]. 
 
 Guam is next to the [[Marianas Trench]], which is the deepest part of the Earth and underwater. It sometimes has [[earthquake]]s, some of which have been very strong. 
 
 Guam is a [[tropical]] island. It is usually quite warm and wet and the temperature does not change very much. From February to July it is dry, but the rest of the year it is rainy. Sometimes Guam has very strong and dangerous storms in October and November.
