 == History == 
 
 Telus was made from a [[merger]] of BCTel, the main phone company in [[British Columbia]] and Alberta Government Telephones, better known as AGT. AGT was owned by the [[government]] of Alberta. AGT wanted to separate from the government and formed a company called Telus in 1990. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Alberta Government Telephones (AGT)|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/telephone/era/agt.html|access-date=2022-05-03|website=wayback.archive-it.org|archive-date=2010-12-08|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/2217/20101208161839/http://www.abheritage.ca/telephone/era/agt.html|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDiH0zLUamIC & dq=alberta+government+telephones & pg=PA35|title=Deregulating Telecommunications: U.S. and Canadian Telecommunications, 1840-1997|last=Wilson|first=Kevin G.|date=2000|publisher=Rowman  &  Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9825-7|language=en}} < /ref >  After that, they combined with BCTel to form the current Telus company in 1999. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Hunter, Jennifer,  " BC Telecom/Telus Merger|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE & Params=M1ARTM0011790|access-date=2022-05-03|archive-date=2007-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810002502/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE & Params=M1ARTM0011790|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  That remaining Telus company purchased Clearnet Communications, a [[cell phone]] company.
