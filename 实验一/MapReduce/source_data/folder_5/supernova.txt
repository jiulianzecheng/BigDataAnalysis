 A '''supernova''' is the explosion of a [[giant star]]. It usually happens when the [[nuclear fusion]] in the star cannot hold the core against its own gravity. < ref > This is the cause of all types of supernova except type Ia. < /ref >  The core collapses, and then explodes.  
 
 The biggest stars that make supernovae are [[hypergiant]]s and smaller ones are [[supergiant]]s. They are [[mass]]ive: because of [[gravity]], they use up their energy very quickly. Normally they only live for a few million years.  
 
 During the explosion, the total energy radiated by supernovae may briefly outshine the entire output of a [[galaxy]]. They [[emission|emit]] energy equal to that of the whole lifetime of a solar-like star. < ref >  Giacobbe, Frederick W. 2005. How a Type II supernova explodes. ''Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics'' '''2''' (6): 30–38. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005EJTP....2f..30G] < /ref >  The explosion blows off its stellar material away from the star, at velocities up to 30,000 km/s or 10% of the speed of light. < ref > Heger, Alexander ''et al'' 2003.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212469#] < /ref >  This drives a [[shock wave]] into the surrounding [[interstellar medium]]. This sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust, which we see as a supernova remnant. After exploding, what is left becomes a [[black hole]] or a [[neutron star]].  
 
 Most stars are small and do not explode.  After their [[red giant]] phase, they become colder and smaller and become [[white dwarf]] stars. < ref name=nasa > {{cite web |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html |title=Supernova |last=Tyler |first=Pat |date=26 June 2003 |publisher=NASA HEASARC: Education and Public Information |accessdate=29 January 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 Supernova explosions happen rarely. The last time people saw a supernova in our own [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]], was in the year [[1604]]. We can see supernovas in other galaxies too. Every year we see 300 supernovas in other galaxies, because there are so many galaxies. Sometimes they are brighter than the whole rest of the galaxy. 
 
 == Types == 
 Supernovas are usually sorted into '''Type I''' and '''Type II''' supernovas. < ref name=gsu > {{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/snovcn.html |title=Supernovae |publisher=Georgia State University |accessdate= 29 January 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 '''Type I''' supernovas have [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that show they do not have [[hydrogen]] in them. '''Type Ia''' supernovas are very bright for a short amount of time.  Then they get less bright very quickly.  Type Ia supernovas happen when a [[white dwarf]] star is [[orbit]]ing a big star.  Sometimes, the white dwarf star sucks [[matter]] off of the big star. When the white dwarf eventually gets to be about 1.4 times the [[mass]] of the sun, it [[wikt:collapse|collapse]]s.  This makes lots of energy and light, which is why supernovas are very bright.  Type 1a have mostly the same brightness. This allows them to be used as a secondary [[standard candle]] to measure the distance to their host galaxies. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Colgate |first=Stirling A.|date=1979|title=Supernovae as a standard candle for cosmology|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=232 |issue=1 |pages=404–408|bibcode=1979ApJ...232..404C|doi=10.1086/157300}} < /ref > 
 
 '''Type II''' supernovas have absorption lines that show they do have hydrogen in them. A star must have at least 8 times, and no more than 40–50 times, the [[solar mass|mass of the Sun]] to undergo this type of explosion. < ref name= " science304 " > {{cite journal| last = Gilmore | first = Gerry| title=The short spectacular life of a superstar| journal=Science | date=2004 | volume=304| issue=5697 | pages=1915–1916 | doi=10.1126/science.1100370| pmid = 15218132 | s2cid = 116987470}} < /ref > 
 
 In a star like the Sun, [[nuclear fusion]] turns [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]].  In very large stars, [[helium]] gets turned into [[carbon]], then [[oxygen]], and so on. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, up through the periodic table until a core of [[iron]] and [[nickel]] is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no more fusion can take place. When the energy released from the fusion process fades it cannot counteract gravitational collapse. The collapse of the core is so rapid (about 23% of the speed of light) that a huge shock wave is produced. The extremely high temperature and pressure lasts long enough for a brief moment when the elements heavier than iron are produced. < ref > {{cite web| author=Staff | date=2006-09-07 | url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/snrs/snrstext.html| title=Introduction to Supernova Remnants| publisher=NASA Goddard/SAO | accessdate=2007-05-01}} < /ref >  Depending on initial size of the star, the remnants of the core form a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]]. 
 
 == Supernovas and life == 
 Without supernovas there would be no life on Earth. This is because many of the [[chemical element]]s were made in supernova explosions. These are called  " heavy elements " . Heavy elements are needed to make living things. The supernova is the only natural way [[Atomic nucleus#Production of heavy elements|heavy elements can be made]]. Other elements were made by [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] in stars. Heavy elements need very high [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] to form. In a macho supernova explosion the temperature and pressure are so high that heavy elements can be made. Scientists call this ''supernova nucleosynthesis''. 
 
 It could be dangerous if a supernova explosion happened very close to the Earth. The explosion is very big and many kinds of dangerous [[radiation]] are formed. But we do not have to be afraid. Only very big stars can explode as supernovas. There are no stars big enough near the Earth and if there was it would take millions of years for it to happen. 
 
 == Important supernovas == 
 [[SN 1572]] was seen by [[Tycho Brahe]]. This supernova helped astronomers learn that things in space could change. < ref name=sciencedaily > {{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081203133809.htm |title=Blast from the past: astronomers resurrect 16th-century supernova |publisher=Science Daily |date=4 December 2008 |author=Calar Alto Observatory-CAHA |accessdate=29 January 2013}} < /ref >  [[SN 1604]] was seen by [[Johannes Kepler]]. It was the last supernova close enough to be seen from Earth's [[northern hemisphere]] without a [[telescope]]. < ref name=seds > {{cite web |url=http://spider.seds.org/spider/Vars/sn1604.html |title=SN 1604, Kepler's Supernova |last1= Frommert |first1=Hartmut |last2=Kronberg |first2=Christine |accessdate=29 January 2013}} < /ref >  [[SN 1987A]] is the only supernova so close that scientists could find [[neutrino|neutrinos]] from it. < ref name=uci > {{cite web |url=http://sn1987a-20th.physics.uci.edu/ |title=Twenty Years after SN1987a |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=29 January 2013}} < /ref >  [[SN 1987A]] was also bright enough to see without a telescope. People in the [[southern hemisphere]] saw it. 
 
 == Effects on Earth == 
 The Earth does have traces of past supernovae. Traces of [[radioactive]] iron-60, a strong indicator of supernova [[debris]], is buried in the sea floor right across the globe.  
 
 The  " local bubble "  is a ballooning region of hot gas, 600 light-years across. It surrounds the [[Solar System]] and dominates our stellar neighbourhood. It was formed by over a dozen supernovae blowing up in a nearby moving clump of stars. This happened between 2.3 million and 1.5 million years ago. < ref > Webb, Jonathan 2015. Exploding stars left recent, radioactive mark on Earth. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35976498] < /ref >  This roughly corresponds with the start of the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s. The connection may be accidental.
