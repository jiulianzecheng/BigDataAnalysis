 '''Azeotropes''' are the mixtures of liquids which boil at a constant temperature. Azeotropes may be called ''constant boiling point mixtures'' or ''azeotropic mixtures''. < ref > Moore, Walter J. 1962. ''Physical chemistry''. 3rd ed Prentice-Hall, p140â€“142. < /ref > 
 
 Their proportions cannot be altered by simple distillation. 
 
 ==Types== 
 Azeotropes are classified into two types 
 #Minimum boiling azeotrope 
 #Maximum boiling azeotrope
