'''Impossibilism''' is an idea for bringing about [[socialism]]. Impossibilism says that socialists should focus only, or at least mostly, on structural changes to society. They should not seek change through social or political reforms, because trying to bring about meaningful change under a [[capitalist]] system is pointless. 
 
 Some political parties that have followed impossibilism include the Socialist Party of Canada, World Socialist Movement companion parties, Proletarian Party and the Socialist League.
