 '''Fracking''', or '''hydraulic fracturing''', is forcing fractures in a [[Strata|rock layer]], by fluid that is put under pressure. Although it can happen naturally, it is now used as a method to force [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] from [[shale]]. < ref name=Charlez > Charlez, Philippe A. 1997.

 ==History and method== 
 Some hydraulic fractures form naturally: certain [[dyke (geology)|dyke]]s are examples. This lets gas and [[petroleum]] from source [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] get to reservoir rocks. The first use of hydraulic fracturing to extract substances from rock was in 1947. 
 
 The modern fracturing technique, called 'horizontal slickwater fracturing', was first used in 1998. < ref name= " Charlez " / > < ref name=US/ >  It made the extraction of shale gas economically practical. The energy from the injection of a highly pressurized fluid creates new channels in the rock. This increases the extraction rates and recovery of [[hydrocarbon]]s, which are used for fuel. In 2010 it was estimated that 60% of all new oil and gas wells worldwide were being hydraulically fractured. < ref name=Montgomery > Montgomery, Carl T.  &  Smith, Michael B. 2010.

 == Advantages and disadvantages == 
 The supporters of hydraulic fracturing point to the economic benefits from the vast amounts of previously out-of-reach [[hydrocarbons]]. < ref name=Golden > Golden rules for a golden age of energy. ''International Energy Agency''. [http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2012/goldenrules/WEO2012_GoldenRulesReport.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517003120/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2012/goldenrules/WEO2012_GoldenRulesReport.pdf |date=2018-05-17 }} < /ref >    
 
 Opponents of fracking point to potentially harmful [[environment]]al effects. These include contamination of [[Groundwater|ground water]], risks to [[Air pollution|air quality]], the migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface, surface contamination from spills and flowback, and the [[health]] effects of these. < ref name=Heat > Brown, Valerie J. 2007. Industry issues: putting the heat on gas. ''Environmental Health Perspectives''. '''115''' (2): A76. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1817691/] < /ref >  For these reasons hydraulic fracturing has come under examination. Some countries are suspending or banning it. < ref name= " Bweek " > France to keep fracking ban to protect environment, Sarkozy says. ''BloombergBusiness''.

 In 2013, some of those countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], < ref name=Bakewell > Bakewell, Sally 2012. U.K. Government lifts ban on shale gas fracking. ''Bloomberg News''. Retrieved 26 March 2013. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-13/u-k-government-lifts-ban-on-shale-gas-fracking.html] < /ref >  lifted their bans.  Now they have regulations instead of outright prohibition.  Fracking can greatly increase the UK gas reserves. < ref > Moylan J. 2013. UK has huge shale gas resources, energy firm says.
