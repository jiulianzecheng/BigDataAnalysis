 A '''window''' is an opening in a [[wall]] or roof of a [[building]], in a [[car]] etc., to let [[air]] and [[light]] in. It is usually filled with a sheet of [[glass]].

 Before glass was used in windows, people in Asia used paper to fill the hole in the wall. The paper would let light in.

 ==How they are made== 
 Different materials are used when making a window. For the frame of the window [[wood]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[Composite material|composite]], [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[fiberglass]] are used. 
 
 Many windows have movable [[window covering]]s such as [[blinds]] or [[curtain]]s. They keep out light, give extra [[Building insulation|insulation]]. It also ensure privacy. Windows allow natural light to enter.
