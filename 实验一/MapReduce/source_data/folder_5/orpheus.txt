'''Orpheus''' is a hero in [[Greek mythology]]. When he played his [[lyre]] the world would sway to the music. It was noted he could charm mortals, Gods and even stones with his music. He was the son of a [[Muse]]. He was a companion of [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]]. 
 
 Orpheus was married to a [[dryad]] named Eurydice. In one version of the myth, while trying to get away from a [[satyr]] Eurydice was bitten by a snake and went to [[Greek underworld|Hades]]. Orpheus rode the ferry across the river [[Styx]] to bring her back from the underworld. He played his lyre to make [[Cerberus]] fall asleep, and moved the wife of Hades, [[Persephone]], with his music. She said he could take Eurydice back to the upper world if he didn't look back at Eurydice until they both got back up to the land of mortals. Racked by doubt, he did look back just before reaching the upper world, and so she was returned to the realm of Hades forever. He was killed by a group of [[Maenad|Maenads]] when they became tired of his mournful music over Eurydice, and his head was cast into the sea.
