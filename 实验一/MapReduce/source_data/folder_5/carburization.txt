'''Carburization''' (often also called '''carburizing''') is how [[carbon]] is introduced into a [[metal]]. It is done to make the surface harder and more [[Wear (erosion)#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] resistant.  
 
 Depending on the amount of time and temperature, the affected area can vary in carbon content. 
 In earlier times, direct application of [[charcoal]] was packed onto the metal for carburization. Modern techniques use carbon-bearing gases or plasmas (such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]]). Carburization is mainly used to harden the surface of low alloy steel. 
 
 Too great a concentration of carbon makes metal brittle and unworkable, so then metals may be decarburized.
