 {{nihongo|'''Miko'''|巫女}} are women in the service of [[Shinto]] [[Jinja|shrines]]. The [[translation]] of ''Miko'' is  " Woman of God "  (chosen by, or totally devoted to, the gods), but the closest meaning is '' " shrine [[maiden]] " ''. In Shinto, there are [[priest]]esses; but Miko are not priestesses, because they have less [[authority]]. However, they can act as priestesses if needed. They usually help Shintoist priests.
