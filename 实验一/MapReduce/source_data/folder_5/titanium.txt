[[File:Ti,22.jpg|thumb|right|Titanium]] 
 '''Titanium''' is a very strong [[metal]] that is used in special applications.  The most common [[isotope]] has 26 [[neutrons]]. Titanium was discovered in 1791 by William Gregor. It is [[chemical element]] number 22 on the [[periodic table]]. Its [[symbol]] is ''Ti''. It has 22 [[electrons]] and 22 [[protons]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Periodic Table - Ptable|url=https://ptable.com/?lang=en|access-date=2021-12-01|website=ptable.com|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Its name comes from the name of the strong Greek gods called [[titans]]. 
 
 Titanium can combine with other [[Chemical element|chemicals]] to make different materials. When titanium mixes with [[oxygen]] from the air, it forms titanium dioxide (TiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) or titania, which forms a hard [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] around the metal that prevents [[corrosion]]. Titanium dioxide is a white pigment that is often used to make things less transparent, brighter, or [[Abrasive|rougher]] - because it does not react with chemicals inside the human body, it is safe to use in foods and other applications, like [[toothpaste]].  
 
 [[Titanium alloys]] are used in [[aerospace engineering]] to make very strong and light parts of aeroplanes. These alloys can replace [[steel]] because they are almost as strong as steel but much lighter. They are also much stronger than [[aluminium alloy]]s, but only a little heavier, meaning that titanium parts can be thinner and lighter, while still withstanding the same [[Force|forces]]. It does not [[corrosion|corrode]] in most conditions, even when exposed to [[sea water]] or [[chlorine]]. However, it can burn at high temperatures, and like many metal [[Powder|powders]], titanium dust is extremely flammable. 
 
 More than a third of the world's titanium in 2021 was produced by a Russian firm, VSMPO-AVISMA, which has a factory in [[Redditch]]. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Muir|first=Martha|last2=Johnson|first2=Miles|date=2023-11-17|title=The Redditch factory with links to Russia|work=Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5f0ca7d7-0ae3-4c43-8bcc-23662607509f|access-date=2023-11-17}} < /ref >
