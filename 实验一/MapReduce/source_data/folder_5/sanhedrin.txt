The '''Sanhedrin''' was a group of [[judge]]s who led the [[Jewish people]] of every city in the [[Land of Israel]]. Their name is [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and means  " council "  or  " assembly. "  There were between twenty-three and seventy-one judges in each Sanhedrin. According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[God]] commanded [[Moses]] and the [[Israelites]] to make councils of judges and to do what they said. 
 
 The '''Great Sanhedrin''' in [[Jerusalem]] led the other councils. It met every day except on holidays and [[Shabbat]]. After the Romans destroyed the [[Second Temple]], the Great Sanhedrin moved to [[Galilee]]. It made its last law in 358 [[Common Era|CE]] when it abandoned the [[Hebrew calendar]]. It stopped meeting because of [[persecution]]. Some people have tried to bring it back, such as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. These attempts have not been successful so far.
