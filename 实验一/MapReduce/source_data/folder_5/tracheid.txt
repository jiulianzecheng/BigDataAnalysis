 '''Tracheids''' are long [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plant]]s. They  transport water and mineral salts. Tracheids are one of two types of elements in the xylem, [[vessel element]]s being the other. Tracheids do not have perforation plates; vessel elements do. < ref > {{cite book|author=Esau, K.|year=1977|title=Anatomy of seed plants|url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofseedpla00esau|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=9780471245193 }} < /ref >  These define vascular plants, as opposed to  [[non-vascular plant]]s. 
 
 All tracheary elements get a thick [[lignin|lignified]] cell wall. When the plant is mature, the [[protoplast]] has broken down and disappeared. < ref > {{cite book|author1=Peter A. Raven |author2=Ray F. Evert |author3=Susan E. Eichhorn |year=1999|title=Biology of Plants|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|pages=576–577|isbn=1-57259-611-2}} < /ref >   Tracheids have two functions. They transport material and provide structural support. 
 
 The secondary walls have thickenings in various forms: rings, spirals, networks or as extensive thickenings except where there are pits. < ref > {{citation |chapter-url=http://preuniversity.grkraj.org/html/3_PLANT_ANATOMY.htm |title=Plant Cell Biology: pre-University |chapter=Plant anatomy |author=G. R. Kantharaj |access-date=2 October 2014}} < /ref >  Tracheids provide most of the structural support in [[softwood]]s, where they are the major cell type. 
 
 Because tracheids have a much larger surface area to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they hold water against [[gravity]] (by [[adhesion]]) when [[transpiration]] is not occurring. This mechanism helps plants prevent [[air embolism]]s. 
 
 The term  " tracheid "  was introduced by Carl Sanio in 1863, originally as ''Tracheide'', in German. < ref > Sanio, C. (1863). Vergleichende Untersuchungen über die Elementarorgane des Holzkörpers. ''Bot Ztg'' 21:85–91; 93–98; 101–111. < /ref >
