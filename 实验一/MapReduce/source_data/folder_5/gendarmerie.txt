 The use of military units for civilian police is common to many eras and cultures. [[Belgium]] and [[Austria]] had gendarmeries (Royal Guard), but they merged with civilian police. Many former [[colonies|French colonies]], particularly in Africa, have kept gendarmeries. The common symbol of the gendarmerie is the inflamed grenade. This symbol was used first by the French gendarmerie.
