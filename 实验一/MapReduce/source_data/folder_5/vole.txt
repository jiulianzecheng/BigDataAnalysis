 A '''vole''' is a small [[mouse]]-like [[mammal]]. It is a [[rodent]] from a [[family (biology)|subfamily]] called the '''Arvicolinae'''. They live in [[woodland]]s and [[grassland]]s. 
 
 There are about 155 [[species]] of voles. There are species in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], North [[Africa]] and [[North America]]. The closest relatives of voles are the [[lemmings]] and [[muskrat]]s, which are in the same subfamily. 
 
 Adult voles, depending on the species, are 7.5 to 17.5 [[centimetre]]s (three to seven [[inch]]es) long. They eat [[seed]]s, [[grass]] or other [[plant]]s, and [[insect]]s. 
 
 Many [[animal]]s hunt voles, for example [[owl]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[fox]]es, [[weasel]]s, [[cat]]s and [[snakes]]. 
 
 The average life of the smaller vole species is three to six months. These voles rarely live longer than 12 months. Larger species, such as the [[European water vole]] ''Arvicola'', live longer. They usually die during their second winter. As many as 88% of voles die during the first month of life. < ref > Daar, Sheila 1997. ''How to control voles in your garden''. VegetableGardener.com.
