 '''Nitrocellulose''' (also: '''cellulose nitrate''', '''flash paper''') catches fire quickly. It is formed by [[nitration|nitrating]] [[cellulose]] through exposure to [[nitric acid]] or another powerful nitrating agent. When used as a [[propellant]] or [[Explosive material#Low explosives|low-order explosive]], it is also known as '''guncotton'''. Nitrocellulose can be plasticized by [[camphor]]. [[Kodak]], and other suppliers, used placticized nitrocellulose as a [[film base]] in photograph, X-ray films and motion picture films. People call this ''nitrate film''. After numerous fires caused by unstable nitrate films, [[safety film]] started to be used from the 1930s in the case of X-ray stock and from 1948 for motion picture film.
