'''Transmutation''' is a basic process in [[alchemy]]. The most important form of transmutation is the change of [[lead]] into [[gold]]. Alchemists tried and failed to change ''base metals'' (metals of very little value) into a metal of high value like [[gold]]. 
 
 However, more recent work by [[James Chadwick]] and [[Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie]] in [[nuclear physics]] has established that [[radioactivity]] does lead to elemental changes.
