 The '''Uffizi Gallery''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Galleria degli Uffizi''), is one of the oldest and most famous [[art]] [[museum]]s in the world. It is housed in the '''Palazzo degli Uffizi''' which means the  " [[Palace]] of Offices "  in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  
 
 ==The museum and its history==  
 
 In 1560, [[Medici|Cosimo I de' Medici]], the Duke of [[Tuscany]], ordered a design of new office buildings for the [[magistrate]]s of Florence. This is why the building is called the  " ''Uffizi'' "  ( " offices " ). The designer was [[Giorgio Vasari]] and the buildings were continued by Alfonso Parigi and [[Bernardo Buontalenti]] and finished in 1581.  
 
 The offices are in two parts which face each other across a courtyard. One end opens onto the [[town square]] and the other opens onto the River Arno. Varsari designed a sort of screen, like a backdrop in an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] theatre. It has arches through which the view of the river can be seen.  
 
 Duke Cosimo had a plan to arrange that finest works of art in the Medici families' collections on the upper floor. This was not done until the time of [[Medici|Francesco I]]. He also commissioned Buontalenti to design the most the famous room in the Uffizi, an octagonal room called the ''Tribune of the Uffizi''. This room contained many of the best paintings. Rich people would often send their sons on a ''Grand Tour'' of Europe. The Tribune of the Uffizi was one of the important sights on the tour. At first, people could only see the gallery by  " request " . (They would ask politely and perhaps be shown around.) The last [[Medici]] heiress, Anna Maria Lodovica, made an agreement with the city of Florence. In 1765 the Uffizi Gallery was officially opened to the public.   
 
 The collection of artworks is so large that some of the works are in other museums in Florence. Many of the statues are in the [[Bargello]]. Today the Uffizi is one of the most popular [[tourist attraction]]s of Florence. In high season (particularly in July), people sometimes have to wait for five hours.
