 '''Quicksand''' is a [[mixture]] of water and [[sand]] or [[silt]]. It has the characteristic of [[thixotropy]]: it looks solid, but when pressure is applied it liquifies (acts like a [[liquid]]). If animals or people stand on it, they sink into it. However, a person does not drown in quicksand. A human or animal does not sink entirely into quicksand due to the higher [[density]] of the fluid. < ref > The science is: objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. < /ref >  It can be difficult to get out: that is the real problem. Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to reduce viscosity of the fluid, and rotating the body so as to float on one's back (supine). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/0928_050928_quicksand.html |title=Quicksand science: why it traps, how to escape |first1=Nicholas |last1=Bakalarfor |publisher=National Geographic News |date= 2005 |access-date=October 9, 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 Water circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as [[clay]].  The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand, and the sand remains a generally solid mass.  This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight, since they move around with very little friction. They behave more like a [[liquid]] when exposed to stress.  Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand, the sand above does not appear to move at all, and can support leaves and other small [[debris]]. This makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment.  
 
 == Properties == 
 Quicksand is a [[non-Newtonian fluid]]: when undisturbed it often seems to be [[phase (matter)|solid]] ( " [[gel]] "  form), but a small (less than 1%) change in the [[stress (physics)|stress]] on the quicksand causes it to turn [[liquid]] ( " [[sol (colloid)|sol]] "  form). There is a sudden decrease in its [[viscosity]]. Under his weight, the person then sinks into the sol (liquidised sand). 
                                                                                             
 Someone stepping in it starts to sink. Around the person dense regions of sand and [[sediment]] form and grip the person. The viscosity of the quicksand seems to increase suddenly. It is now a gel. In order to move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient [[pressure]] on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough [[water]] to [[liquefaction|liquify]] it.  The [[Force (physics)|forces]] required to do this are quite large: to remove a [[foot]] from quicksand at a [[speed]] of one [[centimeter]] per [[second]] would require the same amount of force as  " that needed to lift a medium-sized car " . < ref name= " Bonn " >

 It was commonly believed that the behavior of quicksand was due solely to [[water content|saturated]] or [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s of [[granule]]s in water.  Pressure from underground sources of water would separate and suspend the granular particles, reducing the [[friction]] between them. In 2005 it was been shown that the presence of [[salt]] is important. The [[stability]] of the [[colloid]]al quicksand is changed by the presence of salt. It increases the high viscosity regions of sediment responsible for quicksand's  " trapping "  power. Another finding was that a human cannot be drawn into a saltwater quicksand entirely. < ref name= " Bonn "  / > < ref name=NG/ >

 Quicksand may be found inland (on riverbanks, near [[lake]]s, or in [[marsh]]es), or near the coast. 
 
 One region notorious for its quicksands is [[Morecambe Bay]], [[Yorkshire]]. As the [[bay]] is very broad and shallow, a person trapped by the quicksand would be exposed to the danger of the returning [[tide]], which can come in rapidly.
