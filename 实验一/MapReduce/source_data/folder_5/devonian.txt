The '''Devonian''' is the fourth period of the [[Paleozoic]] [[era]] and the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]]. It lasted from about 419 million years ago (mya) to about 359 mya. < ref > Gradstein, Felix M; Ogg J.G.  &  Smith A.G. 2004. A geologic time scale. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-78673-8}}. < /ref >  It is named after [[Devon]]shire, [[England]], where rocks from this period were first studied. 
 
 Sea levels were high, and there was a great variety of fish and other marine organisms. < ref > The Devonian is sometimes called the Age of Fish. < /ref >  The Devonian fish included the [[Agnatha]] (jawless fish), the [[Acanthodii]] (spiny fish), the [[Placoderm]]s (armoured fish), the [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish), and the early [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish). The Devonian [[strata]] are divided into lower, middle and upper subdivisions.

 During the Devonian the [[evolution]] of [[fish]] into [[tetrapod]]s occurred. < ref > see [[Tetrapod#fishapods]] for discussion and references. < /ref >  Various terrestrial [[arthropod]]s also became established. The first [[seed plant|seed-bearing plants]] spread across dry land, forming huge forests. 
 
 The supercontinent of [[Gondwana]] was to the south, and the continent of [[Siberia]] to the north. The early form of the small continent of [[Euramerica]] was in between. The supercontinent [[Pangaea]] was just starting to form. 
 
 By the late Devonian, the land had been colonized by plants and [[insects]]. In the oceans, massive reefs were built. Euramerica and Gondwana were beginning to converge into what would become [[Pangaea]]. 
 
 == Period ended with extinctions == 
 [[Plate tectonics|Tectonic]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity was high. A series of [[List of extinction events|extinction event]]s occurred towards the end of the Devonian, including a major event at the Frasnian-Famennian boundary in the Late Devonian, about 364 mya.  
 
 A major extinction occurred at the start of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, about 372.2 mya. Almost all the fossil [[agnatha]]n fishes suddenly disappeared. A second strong extinction closed the Devonian period. The late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth. The cause or causes are not known. < ref > McGhee, George R. Jr, 1996. ''The late Devonian mass extinction: the Frasnian/Famennian crisis''. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0-231-07504-9 < /ref >
