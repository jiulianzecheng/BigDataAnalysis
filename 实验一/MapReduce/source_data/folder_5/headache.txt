A '''headache''' is when your head hurts. It is not when you hit your head with something and made it hurt that way, but when your head hurts from inside. Headache is the symptom of [[pain]] in the [[face]], [[head]], or [[Neck (body part)|neck]]. 
 
 A headache can be caused by one of several things, which are listed here: 
 
 * [[Fever]] 
 * Watching [[television]] or looking at a [[computer]] [[screen]] for a long time. 
 * Being tired or [[sleepy]]. 
 * As an effect of [[stress (biology)|stress]]. 
 * By other [[neurology|neurological]] conditions ('neurological' means touching the [[nerve]]s and the [[brain]]), like with [[epilepsy]] 
 
 The second edition of the International Headache Classification (ICHD-2) defines more than 220 different types of headaches in three categories: < ref > Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society.

 * Primary headaches, for example [[migraine]], [[tension headache]] and [[cluster headache]]. 
 * Secondary headaches 
 * Cranial neuralgias, central and primary facial pain and other headaches 
 
 Many headaches can be relieved with [[analgesic]]s like [[aspirin]].

 == Treatments == 
 
 In many cases headaches can be relieved naturally. Many methods such as massaging the temples near the eye, exercising your eyes (blinking, palming) and walking can all help relieve the tension of headaches. Maintaining a healthy diet, with rich [[proteins]] and [[iron]], can keep your brain awake and healthy. One of the main factors is drinking plenty of water. These natural techniques tend to give you long-term relief whilst medication can often give you short term relief. 
 
 There are many medicines which can treat mild headaches, such as [[Tylenol|Paracetamol]], Co-codamol, and [[Ibuprofen]]; but you should always consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking any.
