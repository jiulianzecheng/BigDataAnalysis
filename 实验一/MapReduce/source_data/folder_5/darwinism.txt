 '''Darwinism''' is a term used to talk about ideas connected to those [[Charles Darwin]] had about [[evolution]]. < ref name=antidarwinian > {{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/anti-darwin.html |title=How to be Anti-Darwinian |author=John Wilkins |date= 1998 |publisher=TalkOrigins Archive |accessdate=2008-06-19}} < /ref >  The meaning of 'Darwinism' has changed over time, and depends on who uses the term. < ref name=whatis > {{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/darwinism.html |title=What is Darwinism? |author=Joel Hanes |publisher=TalkOrigins Archive |accessdate=2008-06-19}} < /ref > 
 
 == Summary == 
 # Within any population, there is natural ''variation''. Some individuals have more favourable variations than others. 
 # Even though all species produce a large number of offspring, populations remain fairly constant in nature. 
 # This is due to the struggle between members of the same species and different species for food, space, and mating. 
 # The struggle for survival within populations eliminates the unfit individuals. The fit individuals with favourable variations survive and reproduce. This is called natural selection (or survival of the fittest). 
 # The individuals having favourable variations pass on these variations to their progeny from generation to generation. 
 # These variations when accumulated over a long period of time, lead to the origin of new species. 
 
 == History == 
 The term was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in April 1860. < ref name=westminster > {{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text & itemID=A32 & pageseq=29 |title=Article VIII: Darwin on the Origin of species. |author=Huxley T.H. |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |date=April 1860 |publisher=Westminster Review |pages=541–70 |quote=What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? |accessdate=2008-06-19}} < /ref >  He used it to describe evolutionary concepts, including similar ideas such as [[Malthusianism]] and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencerism]]. In the late 19th century, it came to mean the concept that [[natural selection]] was the only mechanism of evolution, in contrast to [[Lamarckism]]. Around 1900, [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work was rediscovered. Today, Darwin and Mendel's ideas have been brought together. The term 'Darwinism' has become associated with the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. < ref name=whatis/ >
