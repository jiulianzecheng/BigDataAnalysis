 '''''Contra''''' (known as '''''Probotector''''' in [[Europe]]) is a [[1987]] arcade shooting [[video game]]. The player plays as Bill Rizer (player 1) or Lance Bean (player 2), as they try to stop and evil extraterrestrial [[terrorism|terrorist organization]] Red Falcon from taking over the [[Earth|planet Earth]] and making the [[human]] species [[Extinction|extinct]]. 
 
 ==Gameplay== 
 
 Either Bill or Lance is chosen. The player has a rifle with no limit to the number of times it can shoot. However, the player dies after being hit by an enemy once. 
 
 The game has ten stages. For each stage, the player must shoot out the sensors before moving on. A player has 3 lives, and when all of them are lost, the game ends. In the [[video arcade|arcade]] version, the player can [[Continue (arcade option)|continue]] a few times. 
 
 There are three types of stages: 
 
 #Side-scroller 
 #3-D 
 #Boss 
 
 Most stages are [[side-scroller]] stages, though Contra stages follow a basic [[pattern]].
