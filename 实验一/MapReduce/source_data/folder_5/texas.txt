It is the second largest US state by [[total area]] (after [[Alaska]]) with 268,596 sq mi (695,662 km < sup > 2 < /sup > ) and [[population]] (after [[California]]) with nearly 29 million people as of 2019. Its largest cities are [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[Capital (city)|capital city]]. 
 
 Texas became the 28th state in the United States in 1845. Texas has been controlled by Spain, France, the [[Confederate States of America]], and Mexico. It declared its independence from Mexico in 1836. It was its own country, the [[Republic of Texas]], for 9 years (1836–1845). It is called the  " Lone Star State "  and its flag has one star. 
 
 There are many [[tourist attraction]]s in Texas. Fort Worth is known for its [[stockyard]]s. [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] is known for the cattle business and stockyards. In Dallas, industrial [[Technology company|technology companies]] including [[Texas Instruments]] and EDS have their home offices. San Antonio has [[The Alamo]]. [[Houston]] has the [[Johnson Space Center]]. Austin has the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. [[Texas A & M University]] in College Station, [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Baylor University]] in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] and the [[University of North Texas]] in [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]] are other important universities in the state. 
 
 ==Name== 
 The state's name derives from táyshay, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai (a [[Native American]] tribe), which means  " allies "  or  " friends. " 
 
 ==History== 
 Texas was first explored in 1528 by Spanish explorers on accident (they were [[shipwreck]] < nowiki/ > ed on the coast).  It did not become a colony until 1685, when France claimed it. In response, Spain started a rival colony in 1691 by setting up a religious outpost in the eastern part of Texas.  Spain did not come back to Texas until 1716 to protect its colonies in the west from French forces.  Two years later, [[San Antonio]] was founded. 
 
 The pressure between the Spaniards and Native Americans in East Texas stopped many settlers from coming to Texas. To stop the violence and the increasing Native American raids, Spain called a truce between many tribes in 1745 and 1789. 
 
 Tensions rose in Texas after the United States bought a large amount of nearby land from France in 1803. This was the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. People began wondering whether Spain or the United States could claim Texas. 
 
 Mexico won the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1821. Mexico, including Texas, was free from the [[Spanish Empire]]. Americans and other settlers came into Texas when Mexico allowed non-Spanish settlers to settle here. After many settlers came to Texas, Mexico started taxing non-citizens. This outraged many settlers. Many were already angry because Mexico banned slavery. 
 
 Politics in Mexico became violent and several Mexican States declared independence. On March 2, 1836, Texas declared independence from Mexico and soon they were at war. Texas won, but Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent sovereign Republic. Texas soon requested entry to the United States. Years later, in 1845, the US added Texas as a state, < ref > {{cite web|date=1845|title=Resolutions|url=http://legisworks.org/sal/9/stats/STATUTE-9-Pg108a.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525081934/http://legisworks.org/sal/9/stats/STATUTE-9-Pg108a.pdf|archive-date=May 25, 2017|access-date=May 16, 2017|website=Twenty-ninth Congress}} < /ref >  and Mexico broke off diplomatic relations. Mexico resisted offers by the U.S. to buy land extending from Texas to the Pacific Ocean. In 1846, a dispute over the border between Texas and Mexico resulted in armed conflict, and the [[Mexican-American War]] began. The United States won the war, and by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo|Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, in 1848]] won lands that later formed the states of [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]], southwestern [[Colorado]], and southwestern [[Wyoming]]. Mexico received 15 million dollars and gave up its claims to Texas. 
 
 After [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected President of the United States, Texas joined the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]] in 1861 and fought in the [[American Civil War]] in an attempt to become independent from the United States. The Confederates lost to the Union (the United States) in 1865. Texas was restored to full representation in Congress on March 30, 1870. 
 
 On January 10, 1901, [[oil]] was found in Texas, leading to the founding of a richer economy. During a time when the economy was poor, many people left Texas. Texas did not regain the population it had lost until the 1950s and 60s. In recent years, Texas has become a hub for technology and computers. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Texas is the second biggest state in the Union (after Alaska) and is bigger than every [[List of European countries by area|European country]] except Russia. It has mountains, forests, deserts, plains, and coasts. The largest river in Texas is the [[Rio Grande]], which forms the border between Mexico and the United States throughout south Texas. The highest mountain in Texas is Guadalupe Peak. 
 
 Most of Texas is in Central Time, but [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] in Western Texas is in Mountain Time. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.timetemperature.com/tzus/mountain_time_zone.shtml|title=Mountain Time Zone Boundary|website=www.timetemperature.com|access-date=April 13, 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 == Economy == 
 Texas has the second largest economy in the United States after the [[California#Economy|economy of California]]. It had a [[gross state product]] of US$1.887 trillion in 2019. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Gross domestic product (GDP) by state (millions of current dollars)|url=https://apps.bea.gov/regional/bearfacts/action.cfm|access-date=June 29, 2017|website=Bureau of Economic Analysis}} < /ref >  Texas was home to six of the top 50 companies on the [[Fortune 500]] list in 2015 (third most after New York and California). < ref > {{cite news|title=FORTUNE 500 2011: States|work=CNN|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/states/TX.html}} < /ref >  In 2017, Texas grossed more than US$264.5 billion a year in exports—more than the exports of California (US$172 billion) and [[Economy of New York (state)|New York]] (US$77.9 billion) combined. < ref > {{cite web|title=State Exports for TEXAS|url=https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/tx.html|accessdate=October 29, 2013|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=State Exports for CALIFORNIA|url=https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/ca.html|accessdate=October 29, 2013|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=State Exports for NEW YORK|url=https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/ny.html|accessdate=October 29, 2013|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}} < /ref >  As a sovereign country, in 2016, Texas would be the 10th largest economy in the world by [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), ahead of [[South Korea]] and [[Canada]] and behind [[Brazil]]. < ref > {{Cite news|date=June 11, 2016|title=In Opinion: If states were countries by economic output, California would be France|language=en|work=Newsweek|url=http://www.newsweek.com/economic-output-if-states-were-countries-california-would-be-france-467614|access-date=June 30, 2017}} < /ref >
