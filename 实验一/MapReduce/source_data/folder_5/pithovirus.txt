 '''''Pithovirus''''' is a [[genus]] of giant virus which infects  [[amoebae]]. < ref name= " Nature " > {{cite journal | last=Yong | first=Ed | doi=10.1038/nature.2014.14801 | title=Giant virus resurrected from 30,000-year-old ice : Nature News  &  Comment | journal=Nature | date= 2014 | s2cid=87146458 }} < /ref > < ref name= " BBC March 2014 " > {{cite news | first=Rebecca | last=Morelle | title=30,000-year-old giant virus 'comes back to life' | date= 2014 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26387276 | work=BBC News }} < /ref >   It is a double-stranded [[DNA virus]], and is a member of the [[clade]] of large DNA viruses. It was first described in 2014 after a viable specimen was found in a 30,000-year-old ice core harvested from [[permafrost]] in [[Siberia]], Russia. 
 
 It is 50% larger in size than the previous largest known viruses, < ref name= " NatGeo " > {{cite news | title=Ancient  " giant virus "  revived From Siberian permafrost | work=National Geographic | date=3 March 2014 | last=Sirucek | first=Stefan | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140303-giant-virus-permafrost-siberia-pithovirus-pandoravirus-science/ }} < /ref >  but ''[[Pandoravirus]]'' has the largest viral genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 [[megabase]]s of [[DNA]]. < ref name= " Brumfiel " > {{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/07/18/203298244/worlds-biggest-virus-may-have-ancient-roots | title=World's biggest virus may have ancient roots | work=National Public Radio | date=18 July 2013 | last=Brumfiel | first=Geoff }} < /ref > 
 ''Pithovirus'' has a thick, oval wall with an opening at one end.  Internally, its structure resembles a [[honeycomb]]. < ref name= " Nature "  / > 
 
 == Its genome == 
 The [[genome]] of ''Pithovirus'' has 467 different [[gene]]s, more than a typical virus but far less than ''Pandoravirus''. < ref name= " NatGeo "  / >  Its genome is much less densely packed than any other known virus. Two-thirds of its [[protein]]s are unlike those of other viruses. Despite the physical similarity with ''Pandoravirus'', the ''Pithovirus'' genome sequence shows that it is barely related to that virus. It more closely resembles members of some other virus families. < ref name= " Virology Blog "  / >  These families all contain large [[Icosahedron|icosahedral]] viruses with DNA genomes. The ''Pithovirus'' genome has 36% [[Guanine|G]][[Cytosine|C]]-content, similar to the ''Megaviridae'', in contrast to greater than 61% for pandoraviruses. < ref name= " Legendre2014 " > Legendre M.

 === Replication === 
 The ''Pithovirus''' [[genome]] is one circular, double stranded DNA (dsDNA) chromosome of about 610,000 [[base pair]]s (bp.) Its DNA translate into 467 different proteins. < ref name= " 'SIB' " > {{cite web | url = http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/4237.html | title = Pithovirus sibericum | accessdate = 2014-03-10 | work = Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)}} < /ref >  The genome encodes all the proteins needed to produce [[mRNA]]; these proteins are present in the purified virions. < ref name= " Virology Blog "  / > 
 
 ''Pithovirus'' does its entire replication cycle in its host's [[cytoplasm]], not the more typical method of taking over the host's nucleus. < ref name= " Nature "  / > < ref name= " Virology Blog "  / > < ref name= " Coghlan " > {{cite news | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | title=Biggest-ever virus revived from Stone Age permafrost | date= 2014 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25151-biggestever-virus-revived-from-stone-age-permafrost.html | work=NewScientist | archivedate=2014-03-05 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305155750/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25151-biggestever-virus-revived-from-stone-age-permafrost.html | url-status=live }} < /ref >

 Although the virus is harmless to humans, its viability after being frozen for millennia raised concerns that global [[climate change]] and [[tundra]] drilling operations could lead to potentially dangerous viruses being unearthed. < ref name= " NatGeo "  / >  Other scientists deny that this poses a real threat. < ref name= " Nature " / >
