 '''''Wakinosaurus''''' (meaning  " Wakino lizard " ) is a [[nomen dubium|dubious]] [[genus]] of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]. < ref name=prewild > {{cite web |url=http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/w/wakinosaurus.html |title=Wakinosaurus |publisher=Prehistoric Wildlife |access-date=January 21, 2017}} < /ref >  It is named from the find of ''a single tooth''.‭ ‬The genus is dubious (doubtful) because it is almost impossible to assign further fossil material to it. 
 
 The find was made in [[Lower Cretaceous]] deposits in [[Fukuoka]], [[Japan]] in 1990 by [[Masahiro Sato]]. < ref name=newgenus > {{cite web |url=http://hazy.cs.wisc.edu/hazy/share/zifeipdf/10742/input_k2opt.pdf |title=A new genus and species of carnivorous dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous Kwanmon Group, Northern Kyushu |author=Yoshihiko Okazaki, 1992 |publisher=Kitakyushu Museum of Natural History |access-date=January 21, 2017}} < /ref >  The [[triangle|triangular-shaped]] tooth has fine [[serration]]s on its cutting edge, which is standard for a theropod dinosaur. < ref name=newgenus/ >
