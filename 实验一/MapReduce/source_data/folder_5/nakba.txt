 '''النكبة''' or Al-Nakba ( “disaster ” or “catastrophe” in Arabic) is the term commonly used for the '''Palestinian Catastrophe''', an [[Ethnic cleansing]] strategy undertaken by the then-recently formed [[Israel]], that happened to the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] in 1948. [[Jew|Jewish]] military forces, later Israeli, commenced on a major operation with the aim of permanent expelling the Palestinian people so they could create their own nation-state for the Jews. The disaster resulted in the driving out of a majority of Palestinian Arabs from historic [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and subsequently the [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Those who were displaced now live in the occupied [[West Bank]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and neighbouring Arab states. In addition, thousands of Palestinians were killed and injured during this traumatic catastrophe. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Nakba.

 == Historical context == 
 The early decades of the 20th century brought a profound change in the Middle East. A massive immigration of [[Zionism|Zionists]] occurred after the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] drafted by [[Great Britain]] during [[World War I]]. They wanted to settle in Palestine with the intention of founding a Jewish State. Both the surrounding countries and the Arab indigenous populations of Palestine resisted the mass immigration that was arising in their area. This resulted in a heavy dispute between the Zionists and the Arab folks in Palestine. After years of conflict the British government demanded the [[United Nations]] to formulate a solution for the situation that took place in Palestine. The plan to divide Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states was rejected by Arab leaders, they denied any compromise.  
 
 Throughout the negotiations the Palestinian Arabs lacked effective leadership. On top of that the disorder intensified when the independence of the state of Israel was announced by [[David Ben-Gurion]] on May 14, 1948. The British ended the mandate over Palestine on May 15, 1948. < ref > {{Cite book|title=A History of the Modern Middle East|last1=Cleveland|first1=W.

 == Palestinian vs Israeli point of view == 
 Up to the present day, Palestinian and Israeli people have a contrasting perspective on the Palestinian catastrophe, the Nakba. Both sides have experienced the historical events differently, which caused a dispute till the 21st century. 
 
 === Palestinian perspective === 
 The Palestinians often see the Nakba as a dramatic and sad event in the history of the state of Palestine. They see themselves as sufferers of Israeli aggression in their country. Many Palestinians think that they had to suffer because of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], while they were not involved in this [[genocide]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|title=Two Sides of the Coin|last1=Golani|first1=Motti|last2=Manna|first2=Adel|publisher=Institute for Historical Justice and Reconciliation|year=2011}} < /ref > 
 
 In the Palestinian point of view, the fugitives in 1948 were expelled by jewish aggression based on [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite book|title=The Palestine Nakba: Decolonising History, Narrating the Subaltern, Reclaiming Memory|last=Masalha|first=Nur|publisher=Zed Books|year=2012|location=London  &  New York}} < /ref > 
 
 === Israeli perspective === 
 The state of Israel and its supporters mostly reject the description of the events of 1948 as a  " catastrophe "  (the Arabic meaning of the word Nakba). Many of them see it as a  " fight for independence "  and a legitimate response to the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]]. The Israelis see the Nakba as a development of a new state: Israel. Supporters of Israel often say that the Palestinians fled the country by their own decisions and not because of ethnic cleansing by Zionists. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > {{Cite web|title=PIJ.ORG: The Palestinian Refugee Problem and the Final Status Negotiations: A Review of Positions By Nazmi Ju'beh|url=https://pij.org/articles/143/the-palestinian-refugee-problem-and-the-final-status-negotiations-a-review-of-positions|access-date=2022-05-19|website=PIJ.ORG|language=en-GB}} < /ref >  Unlike the the Palestinian viewpoint, the Israeli viewpoint does not recognize or denies the depopulation of Arab villages and destruction of Palestinian homes. Instead, supporters of Israel use terms such as  " abandoned "  property and  " population exchange "  rather than  " confiscated "  or  " expelled.

 == Aftermath == 
 The result of the Nakba was a wave of Palestinian fugitives inside Palestine  &  Israel, but also to neigbouring countries. The [[UNRWA]] (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the near East) stated that there were 520.000 Palestinian refugees in 1948. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 The amount of refugees from Palestine increased significantly as shown in the table below. < ref > {{Cite journal|year=2003|title=Annual Report of the Department of Health|url=https://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/2010011610371.pdf|journal=United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)}} < /ref >
