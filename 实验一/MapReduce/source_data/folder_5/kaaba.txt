 The '''Kaaba''' is a large cuboid-shaped building inside the [[mosque]] known as '''al-Masjid al-Haram''' in [[Makkah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Muslims believe that the Kaaba was built by the command of Allah. The Kaaba’s original [[architecture]] has remained the same for centuries. 
 
 == History == 
 
 === Before Prophet Muhammad === 
 According to Islamic sources, the Kaaba was a place of worship for [[Angel|angels]] before the creation of men. After the creation of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], the Kaaba was built by him. According to [[Qur'an]], it is the first house on Earth. < ref > Seyyed Ḥusain Naṣr, Islamic Art And Spirituality (Albany: State Univ. of New York Pr., 1987),43 < /ref > < ref > [https://quran.com/3/96 Quran 3/96] < /ref > 
 
 The Kaaba was buried under the sand by the [[Noah|Noah's]] [[flood]]. After a period of time, it was rebuilt by [[Abraham|Prophet Abraham]] and his son, [[Ishmael|Prophet Ishmael]]. < ref name= " :0 " > ''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia'' (Peru: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2006), 1008 < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > John L Esposito, ''The Oxford History Of Islam'' (New York: Oxford Univ.

 === After Prophet Muhammad === 
 The Kaaba began to be managed by [[Muslim]] < nowiki/ > s in 630 AD. [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] removed the idols. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Also, the Kaaba was cleaned with sacred water ([[Zamzam]]) under his guidance. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 The general [[architecture]] of the Kaaba remained the same until 1630 because people wanted to keep the original architecture. Only simple repairs and small decorations were made during this long period of time. In 1630, three walls of the Kaaba were heavily damaged by a storm. Then, it was restored by [[Murad IV]], 17th Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Kaaba has remained the same after this renovation. < ref name= " :2 "  / >
