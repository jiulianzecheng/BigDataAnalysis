'''Ryakuji''' (kanji:略字, kana:りゃくじ) are shorthand and usually unofficial forms of [[kanji]].  < ref > {{Cite journal|date=2020-04-20|title=Ryakuji|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ryakuji & oldid=952097586|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.nihongomaster.com/dictionary/entry/53167/ryakuji|title=Japanese Meaning of 略字, りゃくじ, ryakuji|website=Nihongo Master|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}} < /ref > 
 
 For example, 々 is a shorthand form of the kanji 仝, which itself is another form of the kanji 同, which means  " same " . For [[Compound (linguistics)|compound words]] where the same kanji is used twice in a row, 々 is used where the second kanji would be so that it doesn't have to be written again.  
 
 For example, the word ''tokidoki'', which means  " from time to time " , uses the same kanji for  " time "  twice, but is written as 時々 instead of 時時 because [[Japanese language|Japanese]] would see the second compound as redundant. So 々 implies that the second character is the same as the first. 
 
 Other same character compounds include:

 This is similar to English [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]], or letters that combine to make a new letter or symbol such as  & , which was a combination of the letters that make the Latin word  " et " .
