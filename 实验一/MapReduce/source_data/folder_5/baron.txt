It later merged with [[Old English language|Old English]] ''beorn'' meaning  " nobleman. "  The lands of a baron are called a barony. The female title for a baron is '''''baroness'''''. The form of address for a baron is  " Lord "  and for a baroness  " Lady " . < ref > ''Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use'' (London: A.  &  C. Black, 2007), p. 45 < /ref >
