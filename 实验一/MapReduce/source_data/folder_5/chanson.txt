'''''Chanson''''' is the [[French_language|French]] word for  " [[song]] " .  The word is often used in [[music]] to mean any song with French words, but it is more often used when talking about songs in which [[lyrics]] have been set to music by French [[classical music|classical]] composers. 
 
 Very often  " chansons "  refers to the French songs that were sung in the late [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].  People who sang these chansons were called  " chansonniers " . They had various forms, including [[ballade]], [[Rondeau (poetry)|rondeau]] and [[virelai]].  Some composers at the time liked to set popular poetry to music.  The earliest chansons were for two, three or four voices, many of them being for three voices.   By the [[16th century]] most were for four voices. Sometimes, the singers were accompanied by [[musical instrument|instruments]].  
 
 ==Early chansons== 
 
 The first important composer of chansons was the [[medieval]] composer [[Guillaume de Machaut]].  In the Renaissance [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Gilles Binchois]] wrote many simple chansons.  Later [[Johannes Ockeghem]] and [[Josquin des Prez]] composed chansons which had lots of imitation between the voices. [[Clément Janequin]] wrote more simple, [[homophonic]] chansons.  He worked in the area around [[Paris]].  Later composers such as [[Orlando de Lassus]] were influenced by the Italian [[madrigal]]. The style of music started to be used in music for instruments. 
 
 The first book of [[sheet music]] printed from movable type was ''Harmonice Musices Odhecaton'', a collection of 96 chansons by many composers, published in [[Venice]] in 1501. 
 
 ==Later chansons== 
 
 During the 16th century French songs started to be composed with [[lute]] or [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[accompaniment (music)|accompaniment]].  In the [[19th century]] many composers wrote songs with piano accompaniment.  These chansons were often called [[mélodie]]s. 
 
 ==Popular Chanson== 
 In [[France]] today  " chanson "  often refers to the work of more popular singers such as [[Georges Brassens]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[Édith Piaf]], [[Camille (singer)|Camille]], [[Olivia Ruiz]].
