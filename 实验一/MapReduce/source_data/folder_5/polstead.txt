 [[File:RedBarn.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The Red Barn, where the murder happened. It was called this because it had some [[tile]]s on the [[roof]] that were made of red [[clay]]. These tiles can be seen on the left of the picture, over the main door.]] 
 The Red Barn Murder was a [[murder]] (killing) that happened in Polstead in 1827. A man named William Corder [[wikt:shoot|shot]] his [[lover]], Maria Marten. The Red Barn was a local [[landmark]].

He sent Marten's family letters that said that Maria was happy and healthy. 
 
 Maria Marten's mother had [[dream]]s about the murder. In the dreams, Maria's [[ghost]] pointed to where she was buried in the barn. On April 19, 1828, Maria's body was found in a [[wikt:sack|sack]] (a bag) in a bin for holding [[grain]]. The [[Metropolitan Police Service|London police]] found Corder and [[arrest]]ed him. They also found two [[pistol]]s that he had bought the day of the murder. < ref name= " BSE " > {{cite web|url=http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/redbarn-intro.cfm|title=The Red Barn Murder|publisher=St Edmundsbury Council|accessdate=15 February 2007|archive-date=21 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040321155103/http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/redbarn-intro.cfm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
