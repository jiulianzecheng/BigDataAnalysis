The '''stratopause''' is the part of the [[atmosphere]] between the [[stratosphere]] and [[mesosphere]]. In the stratosphere the [[temperature]] gets higher the higher up you go. The stratopause is where it is warmest. On [[Earth]], the stratopause is about {{convert|50|km}} high. The temperature is about {{convert|-15|C}}. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.actforlibraries.org/what-is-the-stratopause/|title=What is the Stratopause|work=Actforlibraries.org|access-date=2017-05-22|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/stratopause|title=stratopause {{!}} meteorology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-22|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hf50AwAAQBAJ & dq=%22The+depletion+of+the+ozone+layer+resulting+from+the+emission%22+of+halogen+atoms+and+the+photodissociation+of+chlorofluorocarbon+compounds+is+of+particular+concern+to+scientists%2C+as+the+layer+prevents+the+most+harmful+ultraviolet-B+wavelengths+from+passing+through+the+Earth%E2%80%99s+atmosphere.+Near+the+strato-pause%2C+the+ozone+reduction+is+slightly+smaller+in+the+drier+stratosphere+because+of+the+stronger+temperature+dependence+of+the+drier+atmosphere. & pg=PA1298|title=Encyclopedia of Global Warming and Climate Change, Second Edition|last=Philander|first=S.
