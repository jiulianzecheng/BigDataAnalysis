 The '''nightshades''' ('''Solanaceae''') are a family of [[flowering plants]].  
 
 Many members of the family contain strong [[alkaloid]]s, and some are very [[toxic]]. Well-known members of this family are [[chili pepper]]s, [[petunia]]s, [[deadly nightshade]], [[mandrake]]s, [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[aubergine]]s (eggplants) and [[tobacco]]. 
 
 Because it is thought that nightshades can cause or increase swelling and pain, many people do not eat them. The poisons in the plants are [[defence against herbivory|defence against animals that might eat them]].
