 A '''dildo''' is a [[sex toy]]. It is most often used in place of an actual [[penis]] for [[sex]]ual reasons. Dildos come in many different shapes, sizes, and materials (most often glass, [[plastic]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], or [[wood]]) for different looks and feels, different uses, and to provide the best stimulation for different people. Some dildos vibrate and pivot for extra pleasure. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Both men and women can use dildos. They are most often put into the [[vagina]] or [[anus]], but are sometimes used in [[oral sex]]. Since dildos are very simple toys, they can be used in many different ways. They can produce arousal to the point of an [[orgasm]]. For this reason, dildos are commonly used for [[masturbation]].
