 == System requirements == 
 
 OpenSUSE 11.1 has full support for [[32-bit]] i586 and [[64-bit]] x86-64 [[Personal computer|PC]] hardware, as well as [[PowerPC]] (PPC) processors. The basic requirements for non-PPC hardware is as follows: < ref > [http://www.novell.com/products/opensuse/sysreqs.html OpenSUSE 11.1: Hardware Requirements] < /ref > 
 
 * CPU: Intel—Pentium 1-4 or Xeon; AMD—Duron, Athlon, Athlon XP, Athlon MP, Athlon 64, Sempron or Opteron 
 * RAM: 256 MB minimum, 512 MB recommended, upper limit of 64 GB on 32-bit version 
 * Hard drive: 500 MB for minimal system; 3 GB recommended for standard system 
 
 Older processors that still belong to the i586 family can be used, for example the [[AMD K6|AMD K6/2]]. When extra language/translation files and documentation are removed and X is not needed, decent console-based router systems can be made using 300 MB disk space. Most console workloads also cope with 128 MB of RAM at the cost of increased swap activity in tight situations.
