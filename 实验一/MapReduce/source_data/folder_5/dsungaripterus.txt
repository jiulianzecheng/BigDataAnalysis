 '''''Dsungaripterus''''' ( " Wing of Junggar Basin " ) was a [[pterosaur]] with a wingspan of 10 feet (3 m). It had an unusual bony crest running along its snout and long, narrow, curved jaws with a pointed tip. The crest may have acted as a [[rudder]] when flying or may have been a [[secondary sex characteristic]]. 
 
 ''Dsungaripterus'''s head and neck were together almost a metre long. Its most notable feature are its long, narrow, upcurved jaws with a pointed tip, making the animal look like a pair of flying tweezers. It had no teeth in the front part of its jaws, which were probably used to remove [[shellfish]] and worms from cracks in rocks or from sandy, muddy beaches. It had knobbly flat teeth more to the back of the jaw that were well suited for crushing shellfish. < ref > Palmer D. (ed) 1999.
