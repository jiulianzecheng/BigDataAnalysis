 The '''Tigris''' is a [[river]] in the [[Middle East]]. It is the eastern of two rivers that define [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia literally means ''(the land) between the rivers''. The other river is called [[Euphrates]]. The [[source]] of the river is in the [[Taurus mountains]] in [[Turkey]]. From there, it flows through [[Northern Kurdistan]] in Turkey and forms part of the border between [[Turkey]] and [[Syria]]. The remainder is in [[Iraq]].  
 
 The river is 1,900 [[kilometre]]s (1,181 miles) long. It comes together with the Euphrates in the [[Shatt-al-Arab]] (which is called Arvand Rud in [[Persian language|Persian]]). The Shatt-al-Arab flows into the [[Persian Gulf]]. The river had an important role in the [[development]] of [[civilization]], as early [[farmer]]s used [[water]] from the river to water their [[crop]]s and produce more [[food]].
