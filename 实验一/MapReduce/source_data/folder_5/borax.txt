 [[Maria Telkes]] used borax in the first [[Solar energy|solar-power]] < nowiki/ > ed home, invented in 1948. The special walls of the home took energy from the sun and stored it in liquid salt. She used borax to keep the energy storage system running well. The borax kept [[bacteria]] from changing the salt solution into something different. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL & u=down54663 & id=GALE%7CCX2274200379 & v=2.1 & it=r & sid=GVRL & asid=2941fe9c|title=Gale eBooks - Document - Maria Telkes|website=go.gale.com|access-date=2020-05-19}} < /ref >
