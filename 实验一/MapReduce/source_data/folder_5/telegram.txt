 A '''telegram''' (Greek tele: distant and gramma: letter) is a written message transmitted by using an electric device. The message was carried along wires, and the text written or printed and delivered by hand or [[teleprinter]].  
 
 Telegrams were very widely used, because private telephones were not usual. Nowadays they are not useful because most people have private [[telephones]] and the use of [[e-mail]]. The idea was developed by the [[British]] [[Royal Mail|Post Office]] as a service for urgent letters.
