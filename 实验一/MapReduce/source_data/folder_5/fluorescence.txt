 '''Fluorescence''' is the light given off by certain substances when it absorbs light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]]. First the substance absorbs the energy, then it emits light. When the light source is removed, the fluorescence stops occurring. It is a form of [[luminescence]].   
 
 In most cases, the light given off has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. < ref > ''Principles of instrumental analysis'' F.James Holler, Douglas A. Skoog  &  Stanley R. Crouch 2006 < /ref > 
 
 One of the most surprising types of fluorescence is when a substance absorbs [[ultraviolet light]] that cannot be seen by the human eye, but gives off visible light. 
 
 Fluorescence is used in many fields such as [[mineralogy]], [[gemology]], chemical sensors ([[fluorescence spectroscopy]]), [[dye]]s, biological detectors, and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent light]]s. 
 
 Fluorescence in the life sciences is a way of tracking biological molecules. A [[protein]] or other component can have a fluorescent [[dye]] attached to it, which allows a scientist to visually find the specific protein with a microscope. < ref > {{cite book|author=Joseph R.
