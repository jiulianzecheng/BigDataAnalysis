 The '''''Hippiatrica''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἱππιατρικά) is a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[compilation]] of ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Writing|writings]], or texts, focused on the care and healing of [[Horse|horses]]. < ref name=McCabe1 > {{harvnb|McCabe|2007|p=1}}. < /ref >  The texts were probably compiled in the 5th or 6th century AD by an unknown editor. < ref name= " McCabe1 " / > 
 
 ==Contents== 
 The writings of seven [[author]]s from Late Antiquity make up the main parts of the ''Hippiatrica'': 1) the [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] manuals of Apsyrtus, 2) Eumelus (a veterinarian in [[Thebes, Greece]] < ref > {{harvnb|Karasszon|1988|p=115}}. < /ref > ), 3) Hierocles, 4) [[Hippocrates]], 5) Theomnestus, 6) Pelagonius's [[Latin language|Latin]] text translated into Greek, and 7) the chapter on horses from Anatolius's text on [[agriculture]]. < ref name=McCabe13 > {{harvnb|McCabe|2007|p=13}}. < /ref >  The seven authors [[allusion|allude]] to the [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] veterinarians [[Xenophon]] and Simon of Athens. < ref name=McCabe13/ >  They were also [[influence]]d by [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] agricultural literature based on Mago of [[Carthage]]. < ref name=McCabe13/ >  In the 10th century AD, two more writings from Late Antiquity were added to the ''Hippiatrica'': a work by Tiberius and an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] set of ''Prognoses and Remedies'' (Greek: Προγνώσεις καὶ ἰάσεις). < ref > {{harvnb|McCabe|2007|pp=13–14}}. < /ref >  The contents of the ''Hippiatrica'' focus on practical treatment rather than on [[Medicine|medical]] [[theory]]. < ref > {{harvnb|McCabe|2007|p=15}}. < /ref >  Also, the texts in the ''Hippiatrica'' come in different styles: [[proverb]]s, [[poetry]], incantations, letters, instructions, prooimia, medical definitions, [[recipe]]s, and reminiscences. < ref > {{harvnb|McCabe|2007|p=14}}. < /ref >  [[Chiron|Cheiron]], the Greek [[centaur]] connected to healing and [[veterinary medicine]], appears twice in the ''Hippiatrica'' and a cure called a ''cheironeion'' (Greek: χειρώνειον) is named after the mythological creature. < ref > {{harvnb|McCabe|2007|pp=10–11}}. < /ref >
