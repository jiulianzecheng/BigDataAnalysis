The inter-district settlement system headed by Zaporizhzhia (suburban zone) is characterized by a high level of industrial and economic mastery of the territory, high value of agricultural lands and pago environment.

 On June 27, 2014, the decision of the Zaporizhzhia City Council adopted the final report of the working group to clarify the founding date of the city and changed the official founding date. The working group concluded that the city was founded in 952 on the basis of the treatise of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus  " On the management of the empire " , as the first written mention of the settlement on both banks of the Dnieper and the island of Khortytsia.       
 
 == Name == 
 Until March 15, 1921, the city was called Alexandrovsk after the Alexander Fortress, founded in 1770. There is no unequivocal opinion in whose honor the fortress was named. The names of Field Marshal General Alexander Golitsyn and Prince Alexander Vyazemsky are mentioned.   
 
 On March 15, 1921, the city was renamed Zaporizhzhia - that is,  " located beyond the thresholds. "      
 
 The name reminds that before the construction of the Dnieper HPP dam in 1932 at the place where the river crosses the rocky southern edge of the Ukrainian Shield, numerous Dnieper rapids, which hinder navigation, ended.
