 '''Chur'''  or  '''Coire''' is the [[capital city]] of the canton of [[Graubünden]] (also called ''Grisons''). About 34.000 people live in the [[city]], which is probably the oldest in Switzerland. The city is on the [[Rhine]] River. 
 
 The name  " chur "  may come from the Celtic word ''kora'' or ''koria'', meaning  " tribe " , or from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[:wiktionary:curia|''curia'']] 
 
 [[Archeology|Archaeological]] [[evidence]] that people lived here goes back as far as the [[Pfyn culture]] < ref name=HDS_Chur > {{HDS|1581|Chur}} < /ref >  (3900-3500 BC), < ref > Schibler, J. 2006. The economy and environment of the 4th and 3rd millennia BC in the northern Alpine foreland based on studies of animal bones. Environmental Archaeology 11(1): 49-65 < /ref >  Various artefacts from the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] have been found in the city. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur]] was created in  the 4th century. It was probably the first [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] to be created north of the [[Alps]]. 
 
 On 1 January 2020, the municipality [[Maladers]] became part of Chur.
