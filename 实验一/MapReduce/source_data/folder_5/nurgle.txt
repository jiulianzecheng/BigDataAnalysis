 In the [[fictional universe]]s of [[Warhammer 40,000]] and [[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy]], '''Nurgle''' is one of the four major [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]] [[god]]s.  Like his brother gods, Nurgle grew from a single [[survival]]ist [[emotion]]: in his case, the emotion was despair. Nurgle is the Chaos god of [[disease]], decay, [[despair]] and [[wikt:destruction|destruction]].  Even though the nature of his [[influence]], he begins to like his victims, caring for them in a [[jovial]] manner close to a loving [[grandfather]]; so he is commonly called ''Grandfather Nurgle'' or ''Papa Nurgle''. He is also called the ''Lord of Decay'', ''Master of Plague and Pestilence'' and ''Lord of All''.  He is shown as a huge, bloated [[humanoid]], with [[Staphylococcal infection|boils]] and [[sore]]s, his body completely [[rotten]] from [[disease]].  He is usually with an [[enveloping]] [[cloud]] of buzzing [[fly|flies]].{{fact|date=July 2022}}
