 == History == 
 
 Yoda has lived for over 900 years and not much of his [[history]] before ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' is known. He is an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]], but his [[species|race]] and where he is from are never said. He speaks the same [[language]] as everyone else but says his sentences sort of backwards. For example,  " Teach you, I will "  instead of  " I will teach you " . 
 
 Yoda is the oldest and wisest member of the [[Jedi Council]]. Even though he is very small, he is very good with a [[lightsaber]] and uses the 4th jedi style known as [[Ataru]].
