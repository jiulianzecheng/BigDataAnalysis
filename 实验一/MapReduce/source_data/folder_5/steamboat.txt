 A '''steamboat''' (also called a '''steamship''' or '''steamer''') is a [[ship]] that uses a [[steam engine]] or steam [[turbine]] to move. At first, these were paddle steamboats. Some had a paddle wheel on the back. Others had two wheels on the sides. Most went down [[river]]s. From about 1836, marine [[propeller]]s, invented by [[Josef Ressel]], were used. [[Claude François Jouffroy d’Abbans]] built the first working steamship in 1783. 
 
 There were many steamboats in the 19th century in the [[United States]] and other countries. However, the first steamboat was built by [[John Fitch]] in 1787. It had many [[paddle|paddles]]. < ref > {{Cite web

He died in 1798, and did not live long enough to see [[Robert Fulton]] become the first person to build a steamboat that could make money. In 1807, Fulton built a steamboat that could travel from [[New York City]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in 32 hours. < ref > {{Cite web

 After the middle 19th century paddle steamers became rare, as the marine [[propeller]] gave more speed and burned less fuel. The new vessels were suited to the open ocean, and were usually called  " steamships " . During the 20th century, marine [[Diesel engine]]s largely replaced steam propulsion.
