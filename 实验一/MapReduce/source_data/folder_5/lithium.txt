{{Infobox lithium}} 
 '''Lithium''' (from Greek ''lithos'' 'stone') is a soft, silver-white [[metal]] with [[Chemical symbol|symbol]] & nbsp;'''Li'''. It is the third [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]]. This means that it has 3 [[proton]]s in its nucleus and 3 [[electron]]s around it. Its [[atomic number]] is 3. Its [[mass number]] is 6.94. It has two common [[isotope]]s,  < sup > 6 < /sup > Li and  < sup > 7 < /sup > Li.  < sup > 7 < /sup > Li is more common; 92.5% of lithium is  < sup > 7 < /sup > Li. Lithium is a soft silvery metal that is very [[wikt:reactive|reactive]]. It is used in lithium batteries and certain medicines. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 Lithium is one of the [[alkali metal]]s. Lithium is a silvery solid [[metal]] (when freshly cut). It is very soft. Thus it can be cut easily with a knife. It melts at a low temperature. It is very light, similar to wood. It is the least dense metal and the least dense element in a solid or liquid state. It can hold more heat than any other solid element. It conducts heat and [[electricity]] easily. 
 
 ===Chemical properties=== 
 It will [[Chemical reaction|react]] with [[water]], giving off [[hydrogen]] to form a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] solution ([[lithium hydroxide]]). Because of this, lithium must be stored in petroleum jelly. Sodium and [[potassium]] can be stored in oil but lithium cannot because it is so light. It will just float on the oil and not be protected by it. 
 
 Lithium also reacts with [[halogen]]s. It can react with [[nitrogen]] gas to make [[lithium nitride]]. It reacts with air to make a black [[tarnish]] and then a white powder of [[lithium hydroxide]] and [[lithium carbonate]].

 Lithium forms [[chemical compound]]s with only one [[oxidation state]]: +1. Most of them are white and unreactive. They make a bright red color when heated in a flame. They are a little toxic. Most of them dissolve in water. Lithium carbonate is less soluble in water than the other alkali metal carbonates like [[sodium carbonate]].

 ==Occurrence== 
 It does not occur as an element in nature. It only is in the form of lithium compounds. The ocean has a large amount of lithium in it. Certain [[granite]]s have large amounts of lithium. Most living things have lithium in them. There are some places where much lithium is in the salt. Some [[silicate]]s have lithium in them. 
 
 The largest current find of lithium on Earth may be at the McDermitt Caldera near the Oregon-Nevada border. That's the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]] on this wiki. < ref > Peter Zeihan on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-GBVRdwXVA]  < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 Lithium ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''lithos'', meaning  " stone " ) was discovered by [[Johann Arfvedson]] in 1817. In 1818, [[Christian Gmelin]] observed that lithium [[salt]]s give a bright red color in flame. [[W.T. Brande]] and Sir [[Humphrey Davy]] later used [[electrolysis]] on [[lithium oxide]] to isolate the element. Lithium was first used in greases. Then nuclear weapons became a big use of lithium. Lithium was also used to make glass melt easier and make [[aluminium oxide]] melt easier in making [[aluminium]]. Now lithium is used mainly in [[battery|batteries]]. 
 
 It was apparently given the name  " lithium "  because it was discovered from a [[mineral]], while other common alkali metals were first discovered in [[plant]] tissue. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 It is made by getting [[lithium chloride]] from pools and [[spring]]s. The lithium chloride is melted and [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]]. This makes liquid lithium and [[chlorine]]. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 ===As an element=== 
 Its main use is in [[battery|batteries]]. Lithium is used as an [[anode]] in the [[lithium battery]]. It has more power than batteries with [[zinc]], like [[alkaline cell]]s. [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium ion batteries]] also have lithium in them, though not as an element. It is also used in heat transfer [[alloy]]s. Lithium is used to make organolithium compounds. They are used for very strong [[base (chemistry)|bases]]. 
 
 It is used to make special glasses and ceramics, including the Mount Palomar telescope's 200 inch mirror. Lithium is the lightest known [[metal]] and can be alloyed with [[aluminium]], [[copper]], manganese, and [[cadmium]] to make strong, lightweight metals for [[aircraft]]. 
 
 ===In chemical compounds=== 
 Lithium [[chemical compounds|compounds]] are used in some [[drug]]s known as [[mood stabilizer]]s. Lithium niobate is used in [[radio transmitter]]s in [[cell phone]]s. Some lithium compounds are also used in ceramics. [[Lithium chloride]] can absorb water from other things. Some lithium compounds are used to make [[soap]] and [[Petroleum|grease]]. [[Lithium carbonate]] is used as a drug to treat manic depression disorder. Lithium carbonate is used for the treatment of bipolar disease and other mental illness conditions. 
 
 ===Organic chemistry=== 
 [[Organolithium compound]]s are used to make [[polymer]]s and [[fine chemical]]s. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Many lithium compounds are used as [[reagent]]s to make [[organic compound]]s. Some lithium compounds like [[lithium aluminium hydride]], [[lithium triethylborohydride]], [[n-butyllithium]] and [[tert-butyllithium]] are commonly used as very strong bases called [[superbase]]s.

 ==Safety== 
 Lithium reacts with water, making irritating smoke and heat. It is not as dangerous as the other alkali metals. Lithium hydroxide is very corrosive. 
 
 == Isotopes == 
 There  are 5 [[isotope]]s of Lithium having respectively 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 [[neutron]]s in the nucleus. The most common isotope in nature is  < sub > 3 < /sub > Li < sup > 7 < /sup >  which makes up 92.58% of the total. The second isotope which is widely available is  < sub > 3 < /sub > Li < sup > 6 < /sup >  which makes up 7.42% of the total. The other 3 isotopes exist in very small quantities. The atomic mass of Lithium is 6.939.
