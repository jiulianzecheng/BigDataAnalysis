 '''''Alamosaurus''''' was a [[titanosaur]], a gigantic plant-eating [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period, about 73 million to 65 million years ago.  
 
 ''Alamosaurus'' was a long-necked, whip-tailed dinosaur. It was about 69 feet (21 m) long and weighed perhaps 33 tons (30000 & nbsp;kg). Fossils have been found in [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], and [[Utah]]. Fossils include fragmentary skeletons (and no skulls). 
 
 Skeletal elements of ''Alamosaurus'' are among the most common Late Cretaceous dinosaur [[fossil]]s found in the American Southwest and are now used to define the [[fauna]] of that time and place. There was a [[climate change]] in this area, it became drier, and this caused changes in the [[fauna]]. Thomas M. Lehman describes it as  " the abrupt reemergence of a fauna with a superficially 'Jurassic' aspect " . < ref name=Lehman > Lehman T.M. 2001. Late Cretaceous dinosaur provinciality. In: ''Mesozoic vertebrate life'', edited by Tanke D.H. and Carpenter K. Indiana University Press, pp. 310â€“328. < /ref >  These faunas are dominated by ''Alamosaurus'' and feature abundant ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' in Texas. < ref name=Lehman/ >  The ''Alamosaurus'' {{ndash}} ''Quetzalcoatlus'' association probably represent semi-[[arid]] inland [[plains]]. < ref name=Lehman/ > < sup > p201 < /sup >
