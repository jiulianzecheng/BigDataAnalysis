 ==History== 
 The Mossi believe that they came from the [[marriage]] of a [[Dagomba]] princess called [[Yennenga]] (or Nyennega) and a [[Mandé]] [[hunter]] called Rialé. Yennenga was a [[warrior]] princess, daughter of a Dagomba king in [[Ghana]]. One day she lost her way and was rescued by Rialé. They got married and had a son called Ouedraogo. < ref > {{Cite book
