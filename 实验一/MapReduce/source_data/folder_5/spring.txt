 '''Spring''' is the [[season]] after [[winter]] and before [[summer]]. Days become longer and [[weather]] gets warmer in the [[temperate zone]] because the [[Axial tilt|Earth tilts]] relative to its [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] around the [[Sun]].  In many parts of the world it rains for hours.  This helps the [[plant]]s grow and flowers bloom.  Often people with [[hay fever]] suffer more, because some plant [[pollen]]s are [[allergen]]s. Many animals have their [[breeding season]]s in spring.  At the start of spring, people suffering from [[seasonal affective disorder]] will feel better.  The vernal [[equinox]] in springtime makes days and nights equally long in the [[temperate zone]].

Spring break is a [[vacation]] period in early spring at [[University|universities]] and [[school]]s in various countries in the [[world]].
