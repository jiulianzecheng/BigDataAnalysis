 '''Akhenaten''' (first known as '''Amenhotep IV''') was a [[pharaoh]] of the Eighteenth dynasty of [[Egypt]]. < ref > Shaw I (ed) 2000. ''The Oxford history of Ancient Egypt''. Oxford University Press, p276. < /ref >  His reign is dated as 1353–1336 [[BC]] or 1351–1334 BC. 
 
 Akhenaten is one of Egypt's most well-known pharaohs. 
 In the fifth year of his reign, he changed his name from Amenhotep IV, meaning  " Amun is satisfied " . He did this because he left Egypt's traditional [[polytheism]]. He founded a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] worship of the Egyptian sun god, [[Aten]]. He destroyed the temples of [[Amun]]. His new religion was called [[Atenism]]. It was the first known attempt at [[monotheism]] in the world. Naturally, this made enemies of the many priests of the old religion. < ref > Redford, Donald B. 1984. ''Akhenaten: the heretic king''. Princeton University Press. < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24714735|title=Akhenaten : King of Egypt|last=Aldred|first=Cyril|date=1991|isbn=0-500-27621-8|edition=First paperback|location=London|oclc=24714735}} < /ref >   
 
 This culture shift away from traditional religion was not widely accepted. This helps to explain why after his death, his monuments were dismantled, his statues were destroyed, and his name [[Damnatio memoriae|excluded]] from [[regnal list|lists of rulers]] compiled by later pharaohs. < ref > Manniche, Lise 2010. ''Akhenaten, Colossi of Karnak''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press. < /ref >  Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, notably under his close successor [[Tutankhamun]], who changed his name from Tutankhaten early in his reign. However, it was [[Horemheb]] who destroyed all the works of Akhenaten. 
 
 Akhenaten was all but lost to history until the late 19th century discovery of [[Amarna]], the new capital city he built for the worship of Aten.  
 Its rediscovery and [[Flinders Petrie]]'s early excavations sparked great public interest in the pharaoh and his queen [[Nefertiti]]. The interest comes from his connection with Tutankhamun, the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and interest in the religion he attempted to establish.
