 '''Constantinople''' ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντινούπολις|translit=Kōnstantinoúpolis}}; {{Lang-la|Constantinopolis}}) was the [[capital city]] of the [[Roman Empire]] from 330 AD and later what historians called the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Constantinople was located in the [[Bosporus]], the [[strait]] between the [[Balkans]] and [[Asia Minor]]. 
 
 == History == 
 For centuries the city was not very large, and was called [[Byzantium]]. In the 4th century, [[List of Roman emperors|Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] made Byzantium the capital of the Roman Empire and renamed it to '''Constantinople'''.  
 
 In the 13th century, Constantinople was [[Sack of Constantinople|looted and captured]] by [[Crusades|crusaders]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]]. The crusaders created the [[Latin Empire]] (1204{{Endash}}1261), with Constantinople as the capital city. In 1261, the [[Empire of Nicaea]] successfully restored the Byzantine Empire, under the rule of the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologos dynasty]]. 
 
 In 1453 the [[Ottoman sultan]] [[Mehmed II|Mehmed the Conqueror]] [[Fall of Constantinople|captured]] Constantinople. The city was renamed [[Istanbul]] and became the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1453{{Endash}}1922). 
 
 Over time, the city's short name in {{Lang-grc-gre|Πόλις|Pólis|city}} became the name [[Istanbul]]. This name became the city's official name in 1930, during the government of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].
