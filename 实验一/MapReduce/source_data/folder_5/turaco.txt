 The '''turacos''' make up the [[bird]] family '''Musophagidae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|j|uː|z|oʊ|ˈ|f|æ|dʒ|ᵻ|d|iː}}  " banana-eaters " ), which includes '''plantain-eaters''' and '''go-away-birds'''. In southern Africa both turacos and go-away-birds are commonly known as '''loeries'''. They are [[Dactyly#Zygodactyly|semi-zygodactylous]]: the fourth (outer) toe can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent [[Crest (feathers)|crests]] and long tails; the turacos are noted for peculiar and unique [[pigment]]s giving them their bright green and red feathers. 
 
 Traditionally, this group has been allied with the [[cuckoo]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Cuculiformes]], but the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]] raises this group to a full order '''Musophagiformes'''. They have been proposed to [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|link]] the [[hoatzin]] to the other living birds, < ref > Hughes  &  Baker (1999) < /ref >  but this was later disputed. < ref > Sorenson ''et al.'' (2003) < /ref >  Recent genetic analyses have strongly supported the order ranking of Musophagiformes. < ref name=Ericson > {{cite journal | last1 = Ericson | first1 = P.G.P. |display-authors=etal | year = 2006 | title = Diversification of Neoaves: integration of molecular sequence data and fossils | url = http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/houde/Ericson_et_al_2006.pdf | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–547 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523 | pmid = 17148284 | pmc = 1834003 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080307225744/http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/houde/Ericson_et_al_2006.pdf | archive-date = 2008-03-07 }} < /ref > < ref name=Hackett > {{cite journal | last1 = Hackett | first1 = S.J. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = A Phylogenomic Study of Birds Reveals Their Evolutionary History | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5884| pages = 1763–1768 | doi=10.1126/science.1157704 | pmid=18583609| bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1763H | s2cid = 6472805 }} < /ref > < ref name=Jarvis2014 > {{cite journal | last1 = Jarvis | first1 = E.D. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014 | title = Whole-genome analyses resolve early branches in the tree of life of modern birds | url= | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6215| pages = 1320–1331 | doi=10.1126/science.1253451 | pmid=25504713 | pmc=4405904| bibcode = 2014Sci...346.1320J }} < /ref > 
 
 Musophagidae is one of very few bird families [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Africa]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|title=Tropical forest biomes|last=Holzman, Barbara A.|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-33840-3|oclc=470649845}} < /ref >  Another order, which is also endemic to Africa are the [[mousebird]]s, Colliidae.  All turaco species are [[Frugivore|frugivorous]], but they also eat leaves, buds, and flowers. [[Common fig|Fig]]s are an important part of their diet. They have rounded wings and long tails and strong legs, making them poor fliers, but good runners. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Turacos are medium-sized [[arboreal]] birds [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where they live in [[forests]], [[woodland]] and [[savanna]]. 
 
 They are [[gregarious]], non-[[Migration|migratory]] birds which move in family groups of up to 10. Many species are noisy, with the go-away-birds being especially noted for their piercing [[alarm call]]s, which alert other [[fauna]] to the presence of [[predator]]s; their common name is [[onomatopoeia]] of this. Musophagids build large stick nests in trees, and lay twp or three eggs. The young are born with thick down and open, or nearly-open, eyes. < ref name=EoB > {{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Marchant, S.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 125|isbn= 978-1-85391-186-6}} < /ref >
