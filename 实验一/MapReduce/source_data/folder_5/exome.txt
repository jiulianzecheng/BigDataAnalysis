The '''exome''' is the part of the [[genome]] composed of [[exon]]s. In RNA, [[intron]]s are removed by [[RNA splicing]]. That leaves the sections of the RNA which actually code for the final [[protein]]. Exome sequencing is the way researchers find the causes of many inherited diseases. < ref > Bamshad M.J.
