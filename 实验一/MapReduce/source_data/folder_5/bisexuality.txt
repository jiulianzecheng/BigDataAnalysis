 In 1948, [[Alfred Kinsey]] published the [[Kinsey scale]]. The Kinsey scale shows that sexuality is a [[continuum]]. This means it moves little by little from heterosexuality to homosexuality. On the Kinsey scale, a ''0'' is someone who is only heterosexual. A ''6'' is someone who is only homosexual. Someone who is equally homosexual and heterosexual (bisexual) is a ''3''. 
     
 In [[biology]], bisexual can define an [[organism]] that has both male and female [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]. This mostly refers to [[plants]].

 A common symbol of the [[bisexual community]] is the [[bisexual flag]]. This flag has a deep [[pink]] stripe at the top for homosexuality, a dark [[blue]] stripe for heterosexuality, and a [[purple]] stripe in the middle for bisexuality. < ref > {{cite web|author=Page, Michael|title=Bi Pride Flag|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129080614/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp|archive-date=29 January 2007|access-date=16 February 2007|quote=The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only, homosexuality, the blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only, heterosexuality, and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi).}} < /ref >  The purple stripe is a mix of the blue and pink colors, representing a mix of homosexuality and heterosexuality.  
 
 Another symbol of bisexuality is the [[biangles]]. The biangles are a pair of [[wikt:overlap|overlapping]] pink and blue triangles. These triangles form purple where they cross.
