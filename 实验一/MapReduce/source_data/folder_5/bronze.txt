'''Bronze''' is a [[metal]] [[alloy]]. Bronze is mostly [[copper]], with some [[tin]] added (usually between 5% and 20% tin) to make it stronger. The most common alloy is just made of copper and tin. Some bronzes add other metals.  
 
 Other bronzes are: 
 * [[Aluminum]] bronze, which uses aluminum instead of tin. 
 * Leaded bronze 
 * [[Silicon]] bronze 
 * Phosphor bronze, which has both tin and [[phosphorus]] added to the copper. 
 
 Bronze should not be confused with [[brass]] which is a different alloy of [[copper]] and [[zinc]]. 
 
 == History. == 
 Bronze was the first alloy that was used by [[human]]s. The first nation that used bronze was [[Egypt]] about 3500 years B.C. This gave the name for the [[Bronze Age]]. 
 
 Bronze is stronger than copper or tin alone. Bronze lasts longer than copper. Pure copper can be oxidized by [[air]] and also by [[water]]. When copper is oxidized by air or water, it turns green (the color of  " copper oxide " ), and falls apart. 
 
 When people learned how to make and work [[iron]], the Bronze Age ended, and the [[Iron Age]] started. Iron can be made harder than bronze, but is susceptible to [[corrosion]] (see [[rust]]). Iron also wears away faster than bronze, when different pieces are moving against each other. Iron is very common, and easy to make. For this reason, iron costs less than bronze. This is the reason why iron is now used where bronze used to be used. 
 
 == Current use == 
 Bronze is still used to make many parts of [[machine]]s. We use bronze when the part must last for a long time around water and air, or must not wear away.  The main things that are made out of it are [[pump]] parts, [[bearing]]s, [[bell]]s, electrical components, [[gear]]s, [[valve]]s, and other things. 
 
 Bronze parts are usually [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in a [[foundry]]. After they are cast, bronze parts can also be worked in a [[lathe]] or [[milling machine]], or [[drill]]ed. Bronze is not normally worked with a [[hammer]] as iron is.
