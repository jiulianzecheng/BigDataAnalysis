 == Chemistry == 
 Iridium is a [[metal]]. Like other metals in the platinum group, Iridium is a rare and expensive  " [[noble metal]] "  and is a [[transition metal]]. It looks like [[platinum]] and is found in [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s. It is exceptionally hard-wearing.  
 
 Iridium deposits are used to identify relative dates of collisions of foreign bodies. Iridium can fold and bend just like [[aluminum]], and remains very shiny. Most iridium is found in the Americas, though some is mined in [[Myanmar]], [[South Africa]], and Russia. Iridium melts at 2410 °C, and boils at 4130 °C. It is the most [[corrosion]]-resistant metal. 
 
 Iridium is not needed in the [[body]]. It is used for the tips of pens. The main uses of iridium are the metal itself and its alloys. 
 
 == History == 
 A man named Smithson Tennant first found it in the year 1803 and is was named after [[Iris (goddess)|Iris]] in Greek mythology. Smithson Tennant found it in the remains when he left crude [[platinum]] in a mixture of [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[nitric acid]].
