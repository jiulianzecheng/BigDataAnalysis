[[Image:Ecozone Afrotropic.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Afrotropic ecozone]] 
 The '''Afrotropic''' is one of the Earth's eight [[ecozone]]s. The zone was formerly known as the '''Ethiopian Zone'''. 
 
 The zone includes [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara]], the southern and eastern parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the island of [[Madagascar]], southern [[Iran]], extreme southwestern [[Pakistan]], and the islands of the western [[Indian Ocean]]. Almost all this land was part of the ancient southern [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]], which started to break up 150 million years ago. 
 
 ==Major ecological regions== 
 Because Africa is a very large [[continent]], and runs north/south acrsoss the [[equator]], the zone has many different [[climate]]s and [[habitat]]s. 
 
 Most of the Afrotropic, has a [[tropical]] climate. A broad belt of deserts separate the Afrotropic from the [[Palearctic]] ecozone, which includes northern Africa and temperate [[Eurasia]]. 
 
 ===Sahel and Sudan=== 
 South of the Sahara, two belts of [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s and shrublands run east and west across the continent, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].  
 
 Immediately south of the Sahara lies the [[Sahel]] belt, a transitional zone of semi-arid short grassland and [[Acacia]] savanna.  
 
 Rainfall increases further south in the [[Sudan]], a belt of taller grasslands and savannas. The Sudanian savanna is home to two great [[flood]]ed grasslands and savannas, the Sudd wetland in the Sudan, and the [[Niger]] Inland Delta in [[Mali]]. 
 
 ===Southern Arabian woodlands=== 
 South Arabia, mostly Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwest Saudi Arabia, has few permanent forests. Otherwise woodlands scatter the land and are very small [[Juniper]] or [[Acacia]] forests. 
 
 ===Forest zone=== 
 A belt of lowland tropical moist broadleaf forests, runs across most of equatorial Africa.  
 
 The largest tropical forest zone in Africa are the forests of the [[Congo River|Congo]] Basin in Central Africa. A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast, from southern [[Somalia]] to [[South Africa]]. 
 
 === East Africa=== 
 The Great Rift Valley gives East Africa its unique mix of deep [[lake]]s, highlands, [[volcano]]es and grassland. 
 
 * Acacia-Commiphora grasslands 
 * [[Serengeti]] 
 * [[Lake Victoria]] 
 * [[Ngorongoro]] 
 * [[Olduvai Gorge]] 
 
 === Southern African === 
 Woodlands, savannas, grasslands and desert. 
 * [[Namib Desert]] 
 * [[Kalahari Desert]] 
 
 === Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands === 
 [[Madagascar]] and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub-region of the ecozone, with numerous [[endemism|endemic]] [[taxon|taxa]] like the [[lemur]]s.  
 
 Madagascar and the [[Seychelles]] are not part of Africa, and that explains why the advanced primates of Africa (monkeys, apes) are not found in Madagascar. This is because Madagascar has not been connected to Africa since the break-up of Gondwana. [[Lemur]]s are found occupying more or less the same ecological [[niche]]s as monkeys do in Africa. 
 
 Other Indian ocean islands, like the [[Comoros]] and [[Mascarene Islands]], are volcanic islands that formed more recently. Madagascar contains several important biospheres: its [[biodiversity]] and numbers of unique [[species]] is high. 
 * Madagascar dry deciduous forests 
 * Madagascar spiny thickets 
 * Eastern Madagascar lowland rainforests
