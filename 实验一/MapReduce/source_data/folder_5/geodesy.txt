 '''Geodesy''', sometimes called '''geodetics''', is a [[science|scientific]] branch of [[geography]] which accurately measures the [[surface]] of the [[Earth]].  
 
 [[Friedrich Robert Helmert]] (1843{{ndash}}1917), who started the discipline, talked about measuring and mapping the surface of the earth. This includes its [[geometry|geometric]] description (the [[geoid]]) and the measurement and description of its [[gravitational field]].  
 
 Some people involved in the discipline look at [[geodynamics]], the [[Crust (geology)|crust]]s, the [[tide]]s, or the movement of the [[geographical pole]]s.
