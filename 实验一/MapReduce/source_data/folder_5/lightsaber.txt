 A '''lightsaber''' is a weapon used in the [[fictional]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. Lightsabers are usually used by the [[Jedi]] and the [[Sith]], and sometimes other factions. 
 
 ==Description== 
 A lightsaber resembles a [[sword]], but instead of having a [[blade]] made out of metal, lightsabers have a [[plasma]] [[laser]] beam for the blade, powered by an internal power cell contained within the [[hilt]]. This beam is very powerful and can cut through almost anything. 
 
 A lightsaber's blade will typically be red, blue, or green. The Sith are known to wield red lightsabers, and the Jedi are known for their signature blue and green lightsabers. In some of the Expanded Universe books, there are lightsabers that appear in a variety of other colors as well.
