 '''Cuisine''' refers to any style of [[cooking]], including its [[Custom|practices]], [[tradition]]s and [[recipe]]s. A cuisine is usually associated with a specific [[culture]]. It is mainly influenced by the [[ingredient]]s that are available to that culture. Cooking methods, customs and ingredients together form meals that are unique to a particular region. When people talk about [[Italian cuisine]], they are referring to the food that Italians are famous for. Cuisine is a [[French language|French]] word that means  " [[kitchen]] " , but it originally comes from the [[Latin]] word ''coquere'', which means  " to cook " .  
 
 Traditionally, cuisines are shaped by a number of things. In some [[Religion|religious]] traditions, certain foods are forbidden by law (an example is pork in [[Islam]]). [[Climate]] and [[trade]] affect the what ingredients are available. Climate may also affect the methods by which food is prepared. Before the exploration of [[Asia]] and [[Americas|America]] by Europeans, certain foods were not known to European cuisine. [[Tomato]]es, [[maize]], [[avocado]]s and [[cacao]], for example, did not enter European diets until [[merchant]]s brought these ingredients back from the [[New World]]. In modern times, cuisines are becoming more and more [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]]. New cuisines continue to develop even today. < ref name= " NYT " > {{cite news | first=Robert | last= Lindsey| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E0DD1F38F93BA2575BC0A963948260 & sec=travel & pagewanted=print | title= California Grows Her Own Cuisine. | work=[[New York Times]] | date= 18 August 1985}} < /ref > 
 
 Cuisines have different courses or three meals [[Breakfast]], [[Lunch]] and [[Dinner]]. [[Ancient Greeks]] had breakfast—bread dipped in wine.  The bread was made from [[barley]], the main source of all bread in ancient times.  It was probably hard, which is why the Greeks would dip it in the wine, to soften it and make it easier to eat. 
 
 The history of breakfast goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] who ate something called a teganites (τηγανίτης), which resembled a pancake. These were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and usually topped with honey or cheese.
