 '''''Sphyrna''''' is one of the two [[genus|genera]] in the [[Hammerhead shark]] group, and is the largest genera out of the two, with eight members in it. The word ''Sphyrna'' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning  " hammer " , which refers to the shape of the shark's head. 
 
 == Description== 
 Members in the ''Sphyrna'' group measure in size from the [[Scoophead]],  which is 100 centimeters (1 meter) long, to the [[Great hammerhead shark]], which is 610 centimeters (6.1 meters) long. The [[Smalleye Hammerhead Shark]] weighs around 9 & nbsp;kg, and the Great hammerhead shark weighs about 230 & nbsp;kg. Members of this group are usually light grey or brownish grey in colour with a tint of green, and have a white belly. 
 
 == Feeding== 
 Members of the ''Sphyrna'' group's favourite type of food are [[stingray]]s. But they also eat [[crustacean]]s like [[blue crab]]s and [[shrimp]], [[mollusc]]s like [[octopus]]es and [[squid]]s, many types of [[fish]] like [[sardine]]s and [[herring]]s, and other types of [[shark]]s. When they can not find food they start eating each other, but the [[Great hammerhead shark]] is known to eat its own young. 
 
 == Reproduction== 
 Members of this group are mainly [[viviparous]], but in 2007, a [[bonnethead]] was found to be capable of [[asexual reproduction]]. They give birth to around 12-40 young at a time. Once they are born, young ones come together in groups, and swim towards warmer waters. They then stay together in groups until they are older and big enough to live on their own. They live for around 20â€“30 years.
