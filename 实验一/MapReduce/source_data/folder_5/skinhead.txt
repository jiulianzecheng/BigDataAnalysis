'''Skinheads''', named after their short haircuts, are members of a [[subculture]] that originated in [[Britain]] in late [[1960s]], where they were closely tied to the [[Rude Boys]] and the [[Mod]]s. They shave their heads, because originally most of them were workers in factories and they had to be bald, so their hair could not get caught in the machines.  
 
 Traditional skinheads identify with the original skinhead movement ( " The Spirit of '[[1969|69]] " ) in music, style, and/or working class pride. Skinheads listen to [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], [[reggae]], [[Oi!]] and [[punk]] music. 
 
 People who are not part of the group often see Skinheads as being politically close to the [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] (or White Power) movement. Often Skinheads are seen as part of that movement. This is wrong, given that there are many young people in the movement who have no political views at all. Many Skinheads are also not violent, unless they are provoked.
