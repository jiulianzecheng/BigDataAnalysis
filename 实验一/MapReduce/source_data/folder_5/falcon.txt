 '''Falcons''' are small to medium-sized [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] related to [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s, and [[vulture]]s. They usually have pointed wings and long tails.  
 
 Most falcons eat small [[mammal]]s. Some species hunt other [[birds]], which they take in flight. Like hawks, most falcons have dark [[gray]] or [[brown]] backs and wings, with [[white]] undersides. 
 
 The [[peregrine falcon]] is found over most of the world and is famous for hunting birds by diving down on them at 320 [[km/h]] (200 [[mi/h]]). It was nearly wiped out in [[North America]] by the use of [[pesticide]]s, but has since made a recovery.  
 
 In some countries falcons are used in falconry. This means people catch the birds and make them hunt for them. Long ago this was a way for people to get more food but today it is a [[sport]]. 
 
 ==Winter larder== 
 On the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] island of [[Mogador]], falcons seem to imprison small birds by trapping them in [[crevasse]]s, presumably saving them to eat later. 
 
 Mogador has the ruins of a [[fortress]], a [[mosque]] and a [[prison]]. Today the island is a [[nature reserve]], where Eleonora’s falcons nest among the ruins. They hunt migrating [[warbler]]s, [[hoopoe]]s and other birds.  
 
 Researchers came across small birds trapped in deep cavities, their flight and tail feathers removed. The birds were unable to move their wings or use their dangling legs. < ref name= " snack " > Falcons imprison live birds to keep them fresh for a later meal. ''New Scientist''.
