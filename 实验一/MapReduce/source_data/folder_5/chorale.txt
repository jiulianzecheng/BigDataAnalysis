 A '''chorale''' (pronounce:  " Ko-RAHL " ) is a [[hymn]] which is sung in a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church by all the people. Chorales developed during the late [[Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque]] period. Most of them were written at that time. 
 
 [[Martin Luther]] thought that the [[congregation]] (people worshipping in church) should have [[music]] to sing that was not too difficult. He thought that the words should be in [[German language|German]] instead of [[Latin]] so that everybody would understand what they were singing about. Luther wrote the words of many chorales himself. He even composed some of [[melody|melodies]] himself, such as ''Ein' feste Burg'' (''A Mighty Fortress''). Sometimes he used the traditional [[Gregorian Chant]] melodies from the [[Catholic]] worship and added new German words to it, for example ''Christ lag in Todesbanden'' (''Christ lay in Death's Dark Bonds''). 
 
 The words of a chorale have a rhyming pattern. Most of the melodies have an AAB shape (the melody of the first part sung twice, then the second part). This shape is called  " Bar form "  in German. 
 
 [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used many chorale tunes, usually adding [[harmony]] of his own. He used these in his [[cantata]]s. Many of these chorales in four-part harmonies are sung as hymns today in German Protestant churches, and some of the tunes are used in English-speaking countries as well. 
 
 Chorale tunes also appear in [[chorale prelude]]s, pieces for the [[pipe organ|organ]]. These would usually have been played during the church services before the chorale was sung. 
   
 Chorales were used by many later composers in their compositions, e.g. [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Max Reger]].
