 A '''cathedral''' is a [[Christian]] [[Church (building)|church]] that is the seat of a [[Bishop]]. As cathedrals are the seat of a bishop, they are central church of a [[diocese]]. Only those [[Christian denomination]]s that have bishops have cathedrals. Cathedrals can be found in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] as well as some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches.  
 
 In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], the terms  " kathedrikos naos "  (literally:  " cathedral shrine " ) and  " metropolis "  (literally  " mother city " ) are both used to describe the same thing.  " Metropolis "  is more common, but both terms are officially used. 
   
 There are variations on the use of the term  " cathedral " ; for example, some [[Protestant Reformation|pre-Reformation]] cathedrals in [[Scotland]] now within the [[Church of Scotland]] still retain the term cathedral, despite the Church's [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] polity which does not have bishops. As cathedrals are often particularly impressive buildings, the term is often used incorrectly to refer to any large important church. Some diocese, however, have other churches that are bigger than the cathedral. 
 
 Several cathedrals in [[Europe]], such as [[Strasbourg]], and in [[England]] at [[York]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Southwell]], are referred to as [[Minster (cathedral)|''Minster'']] (German: ''Münster'') churches, from Latin ''monasterium'', because the establishments were served by [[Canon (church)|canons]] living in community or may have been an [[abbey]], prior to the [[Reformation]]. The other kind of great church in Western Europe is the [[abbey]]. 
 
 == Definition == 
 
 The word cathedral is derived from the Latin noun  " cathedra "  (''seat'' or ''chair''), and refers to the presence of the bishop's or archbishop's chair or throne. In the ancient world, the chair was the symbol of a teacher and thus of the bishop's role as teacher, and also of an official presiding as a magistrate and thus of the bishop's role in governing a diocese. 
 
 The word cathedral, though now grammatically used as a noun, is originally the adjective in the phrase  " cathedral church " , from the Latin  " ecclesia cathedralis " . The seat marks the place set aside in the prominent church of the diocese for the head of that diocese and is therefore a major symbol of authority. < ref > New Standard Encyclopedia, 1992 by Standard Educational Corporation, Chicago, Illinois; page C-172/3 < /ref > 
 
 Many cathedrals are very old. 
 
 ==Cathedrals which are not the seat of a bishop== 
 Some churches are called ''cathedral'', but they are not the seat of a bishop. This  may be because the way the church is organised changed over time. This is the case for [[Our Lady of Sorrows Church, Poprad]], in [[Slovakia]], for example. In [[Slovak language]], this church is called ''cathedral''. It is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Spiš]]. This diocese was re-organised several times. Currently, the cathedral of the diocese is [[St. Martin's Cathedral (Spišská Kapitula)]]. Churches that formerly were a diocesan seat may be called concathedral, co-cathedral, or pro-cathedral.
