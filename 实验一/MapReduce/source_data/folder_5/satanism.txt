 '''Satanism''' is a word that has several different meanings. It can describe different [[religion]]s and [[philosophy|philosophies]].  
 
  [[File:Peter's Cross.svg|thumb|200px|The '''Cross of [[Saint Peter]]''', an [[:wikt:upside down|upside down]] [[Latin cross]], is also used as a symbol for Satanism]] 
 
 Sometimes the word ''Satanism'' is just used to say that the person using it does not like a group, but the group themselves do not think of themselves as Satanists.  Used like this, it is just used to say the speaker disapproves of a group.  A lot of groups, like [[Pagan]]s, or even [[Protestant]]s have in the past been called Satanists by some people.{{fact|date=July 2022}} 
 
 The word is often used by people who do not know much about Satanists, who think that Satanism means the [[worship]] of an evil being called [[Satan]], and that Satanists want him to win in a war against good represented by  " God " .  This is not true for most Satanists.  For them, Satan is only a [[symbol]] for the [[freedom]] to be [[self|themselves]], and the word [[Satan]] is used as a symbol for man's inner desires and for [[knowledge]].  These people read the writings of [[Anton LaVey]] and are sometimes called LaVeyan Satanists.  There are several modern Satanic groups of different types, with the most well known being the [[Church of Satan]], created in [[1966]] by [[Anton LaVey]], who also wrote [[The Satanic Bible]]. Even though these types of satanists are atheists, meaning they do not believe in a higher being, they do practice magic. They believe that there is no [[afterlife]]. 
 
 Other types of Satanists do worship Satan.  They are called [[theism|theistic]] or [[traditional]] Satanists, because they believe their religion is older.  They believe their religion is similar to that of [[Witch]]es. 
 
 Some ethnoreligious groups were (and still are) falsely accused of being Satanists, for example: it was believed that [[Wicca|Wiccans]] were Satanists because the [[god]] worshipped by them has [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s (a trait commonly associated with [[Baphomet]], a Satanic idol, when in fact it means [[fertility]] for Wiccans) and due to the demonization of [[paganism]] by Christians as well, the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Yazidi]] were also accused by Muslims and Christians alike of being Satanists because [[Melek Taus|Melek Taûs]], the central deity in Yazidism is similar to [[Iblis]] (the [[Islam]]ic equivalent of [[Satan]]), and the Afro-Brazilian religions [[Umbanda]] and [[Candomblé]] were thought to be  " Satanic "  by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonizers]] and [[Jesuit]] missionaries in [[Brazil]] and its [[Deity|deities]] (''[[orisha]]s'') deemed to be  " [[demon]]s "  purely based on [[prejudice]] and [[racism]] towards the African slaves and their culture.
