 '''HipHop Virtual Machine''' ('''HHVM''') is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] virtual machine based on [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time (JIT) compilation]] that serves as an execution engine for the [[Hack (programming language)|Hack programming language]] and used to support [[PHP]] execution before the release of HHVM version 4. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/02/11/hhvm-4.0.0.html | title=HHVM 4.0.0 }} < /ref >  By using the principle of JIT compilation, Hack code is first transformed into intermediate '''HipHop bytecode''' ('''HHBC'''), which is then dynamically translated into [[x86-64]] [[machine code]], optimized, and natively executed. < ref > {{cite conference
