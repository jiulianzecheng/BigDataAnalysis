 In [[mammals]] like [[humans]], the gases come from two sources: swallowed [[air]] (for example, while [[eating]], [[talking]] or [[drinking]]) and gases naturally created by [[bacteria]] in the body during [[digestion]]. Of the gases that come out during flatulence, most of it is [[nitrogen]] (which has the [[chemical formula]] N < sub > 2 < /sub >  and makes up between 21% to 89% of all the gases), followed by [[hydrogen]] (H), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO < sub > 2 < /sub > ), [[oxygen]] (O < sub > 2 < /sub > ) and [[methane]] (CH < sub > 4 < /sub > ). < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.healthline.com/symptom/flatulence|title=Flatulence: Causes, Symptoms and Diagnosis|website=www.healthline.com|date=30 July 2012 |language=en|accessdate=2018-02-20}} < /ref >
