 '''Plants''' are one of five big groups ([[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]) of living things. They are [[autotroph]]ic [[eukaryote]]s, which means they have complex [[cell (biology)|cells]], and make their own food. Usually, they cannot move (not counting [[Cell growth|growth]]). 
 
 Plants include familiar types such as [[tree]]s, [[herb]]s, [[Shrub|bushes]], [[grass]]es, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, and [[green algae]]. The scientific study of plants, known as [[botany]], has identified about 391,000 [[extant]] (living) [[species]] of plants.  < ref > {{cite web |title=How many plant species are there in the world? Scientists now have an answer |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2016/05/many-plants-world-scientists-may-now-answer/ |website=Mongabay Environmental News |accessdate=13 October 2023 |date=12 May 2016}} < /ref >  [[Fungus|Fungi]] and non-green [[algae]] are not [[biological classification|classified]] as plants. 
 
 Most plants grow in the ground, with [[Plant stem|stem]]s in the air and [[root]]s below the surface. Some float on water. The root part absorbs water and some [[nutrient]]s the plant needs to live and grow. These climb the stem and reach the leaves. The evaporation of water from pores in the [[leaf|leaves]] pulls water through the plant. This is called [[transpiration]]. 
 
 A plant needs [[sunlight]], [[carbon dioxide]], minerals and [[water]] to make food by [[photosynthesis]]. A green substance in plants called [[chlorophyll]] traps the [[energy]] from the Sun needed to make food. Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves, inside [[plastid]]s, which are inside the [[leaf]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The leaf can be thought of as a food factory. Leaves of plants vary in shape and size, but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy. Once the food is made in the leaf, it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots. < ref > Asimov, Isaac 1968. ''Photosynthesis''. Basic Books, New York, London. {{ISBN|0-465-05703-9}}. < /ref > < ref > Intermediate Learn Science, grades 5-6, by Mike Evans and Linda Ellis < /ref > 
 
 The word  " plant "  can also mean the action of putting something in the ground. For example, [[farm]]ers plant [[seed]]s in the field.

 ==The plant food factory== 
 [[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|250px|Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''Plagiomnium affine'']] 
 At least some plant cells contain [[photosynthetic]] [[organelle]]s ([[plastid]]s) which enable them to make [[food]] for themselves. With [[sunlight]], [[water]], and [[carbon dioxide]], the plastids make [[sugar]]s, the basic [[molecule]]s needed by the plant. Free [[oxygen]] (O < sub > 2 < /sub > ) is produced as a by-product of photosynthesis. < ref > Smith A.L. 1997. ''Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology''. Oxford University Press. p508 {{ISBN|0-19-854768-4}}.  " Photosynthesis -- the synthesis by organisms of organic chemical compounds, esp. carbohydrates, from carbon dioxide using energy obtained from light rather than the oxidation of chemical compounds " . < /ref > 
 
 Later, in the cell cytoplasm, the sugars may be turned into [[amino acids]] for [[protein]]s, [[nucleotide]]s for [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], and [[carbohydrate]]s such as [[starch]]. This process needs certain [[mineral]]s: [[nitrogen]], [[potassium]], [[phosphorus]], [[iron]] and [[magnesium]]. < ref > Rabinowitch E. and Govindjee 1969. ''Photosynthesis''. Wiley, London. {{ISBN|0-471-70424-5}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Plant nutrients=== 
 Plant nutrition is the study of the [[chemical element]]s that are necessary for plant growth. 
 
 Macronutrients: 
 * N = [[Nitrogen]] (Carbohydrates, amino acids  &  glycolipids) 
 * P = [[Phosphorus]] ([[ATP]] and the energy cycle) 
 * K = [[Potassium]] (water regulation, opening and closing of stomata in some plant species) 
 * Ca = [[Calcium]] (transport of other nutrients) 
 * Mg = [[Magnesium]] (major constituent of [[chlorophyll]], activator to various [[enzyme]]s) 
 * S = [[Sulfur]] (some [[amino acid]]s) 
 * Si = [[Silicon]] (cell walls) 
 
 Micronutrients (trace elements) include: 
 * Cl = [[Chlorine]] ([[osmosis]] and [[ion]] balance) 
 * Fe = [[Iron]] (photosynthesis ans enzyme co-factor) 
 * B = [[Boron]] ([[sugar]] transport and [[cell division]]) 
 * Mn = [[Manganese]] (building chloroplasts) 
 * Na = [[Sodium]] (various) 
 * Zn = [[Zinc]] (activator to many enzymes) 
 * Cu = [[Copper]] (photosynthesis) 
 * Ni=  [[Nickel]] (an enzyme) 
 * Mo = [[Molybdenum]] (enzyme co-factors) 
 
 ==Roots== 
 The [[root]]s of plants perform two main functions. First, they anchor the plant to the ground. Second, they absorb [[water]] and various [[nutrient]]s dissolved in water from the [[soil]]. Plants use the water to make food. The water also provides the plant with support. Plants that lack water become very limp and their stems cannot support their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Plants which specialise in [[desert]] areas are called [[xerophyte]]s or phreatophytes, depending on the type of root growth. 
 
 Water is transported from the roots to the rest of the plant through special vessels in the plant. When the water reaches the leaves, some of it [[evaporate]]s into the air. Many plants need the help of [[fungi]] to make their roots work properly. This plant/fungi [[symbiosis]] is called [[mycorrhiza]]. [[Rhizobia]] [[bacteria]] in root nodules help some plants get [[nitrogen]]. < ref > Mauseth, James D. 2003. ''Botany: an introduction to plant biology''. Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston. < /ref > 
 
 ==Flowering plant reproduction== 
 {{main|Flowering plant sexuality}} 
 ===Flowers and pollination=== 
 [[File:Lillium_Stamens.jpg|thumb|Reproductive parts of Easter Lily (''[[Lilium longiflorum]]''). 1. & nbsp;Stigma, 2. & nbsp;Style, 3. & nbsp;Stamens, 4. & nbsp;Filament, 5. & nbsp;Petal]] 
 
 [[Flowers]] are the reproductive organ only of ''flowering'' plants ([[Angiosperm]]s). The petals of a flower are often brightly colored and scented to attract [[insect]]s and other pollinators. The [[stamen]] is the male part of the plant. It is composed of the ''filament'' (a stalk) that holds the [[anther]], which produces the pollen. [[Pollen]] is needed for plants to produce seeds. The [[carpel]] is the female part of the flower. The top part of the carpel contains the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. The [[Carpel|style]] is the neck of the carpel. The [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] is the swollen area at the bottom of the carpel. The ovary produces the seeds. The [[sepal]] is a leaf that protects a flower as a bud. 
 
 How pollen moves from one flower to another flower is called [[pollination]]. This transfer can happen in different ways. Insects such as [[bee]]s are attracted to bright, scented flowers. When bees go into the flower to gather [[nectar]], the spiky pollen sticks to their back legs. The sticky stigma on another flower catches the pollen when the bee lands or flies nearby it. 
 
 Some flowers use the wind to carry pollen. Their dangling stamens produce lots of pollen that is light enough to be carried by the wind. Their flowers are usually small and not highly coloured. The stigmas of these flowers are feathery and hang outside the flower to catch the pollen as it falls. < ref > Pous, Dinora. ''Science and plants''. Blue Planet. < /ref > 
 
 ===Seed travelers=== 
 A plant produces many [[spore]]s or [[seed]]s. Lower plants such as [[moss]] and [[fern]]s produce spores. The [[seed plant]]s are the [[Gymnosperm]]s and Angiosperms. If all the seeds fell to the ground besides the plant, the area might become overcrowded. There might not be enough water and minerals for all the seeds. Seeds usually have some way to get to new places. Some seeds can be dispersed by the wind or by water. Seeds inside juicy fruits are dispersed after being eaten. Sometimes, seeds stick to animals and are dispersed that way. < ref > Fenner, Michael and Thompson, Ken 2005. ''The ecology of seeds''. Cambridge. {{ISBN|978-0-521-65368-8}} < /ref >

 The question of the earliest plant fossils depends on what is meant by the word  " plant " . 
 #If by plants we mean [[phototroph]]s using [[chlorophyll]], then [[cyanobacteria]] in [[stromatolites]] are the first fossils, 3,450 million years ago (mya) in the [[Archaean]] [[eon]]. The remarkable precision is possible because the fossils were sandwiched between [[lava]] flows that could be precisely [[radiometric dating|dated]] from embedded [[zircon]] [[crystals]]. < ref > J. William Schopf 1999. ''Cradle of Life: the discovery of Earth's earliest fossils''. Princeton U. Press (pages 87-89 and figure 3.9) {{ISBN|0-691-00230-4}} < /ref > < ref > Knoll, Andrew H. 2004. ''Life on a young planet: the first three billion years of evolution on Earth''. Princeton, N.J. {{ISBN|0-691-12029-3}} < /ref > 
 #If by plants we include all types of algae, then the earliest known [[red algae]] lived 1.6 billion years ago. Fossils of them were recently found in India. < ref > Briggs, Helen 2017. 'Oldest plants on Earth' discovered. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39267153] < /ref > 
 #If by plants we mean green plants, [[Viridiplantae]], then the first fossils are [[green algae]]. This is probably the majority position amongst professional botanists. There is convincing evidence for the [[monophyly]] of [[charophyte]] [[green algae]] and [[embryophytes]]. < ref > {{cite journal |quote=no |author=Lewis L.A  &  R.M. McCourt 2004 |title=Green algae and the origin of land plants |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=2004 |volume=91 |issue=10 |pages=1535–1556 |doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1535 |pmid=21652308 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/91/10/1535?maxtoshow= & HITS=10 & hits=10 & RESULTFORMAT= & searchid=1 & FIRSTINDEX=0 & sortspec=relevance & volume=91 & firstpage=1535 & resourcetype=HWCIT |access-date=2012-12-21 |archive-date=2007-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028172328/http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/91/10/1535?maxtoshow= & HITS=10 & hits=10 & RESULTFORMAT= & searchid=1 & FIRSTINDEX=0 & sortspec=relevance & volume=91 & firstpage=1535 & resourcetype=HWCIT |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  There are still two choices: 
 ##[[Acritarch]]s (a group of organic-walled microfossils) may be reproductive [[cyst]]s of green algae. If so, they are present in the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[era]], 1000 mya. < ref name=Willis > Willis K.J.  &  McElwain J.C. 2002. ''The evolution of land plants''. Oxford University Press, 38. {{ISBN|0-19-850065-3}} < /ref > 
 ##Otherwise, there is a large increase in [[plankton]]ic algae around 540 mya in the [[Cambrian]] period. < ref name=Willis/ > 
 #If by plants we mean [[land plants]], the first fossils are in the [[Silurian]]. < ref name= " Wellman " > Wellman, Charles H.; Osterloff, Peter L.  &  Mohiuddin, Uzma 2003. Fragments of the earliest land plants. ''Nature'' '''425''': 282–285. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/full/nature01884.html] < /ref > 
 
 By the [[Silurian]], fossils of whole plants are preserved, including the [[lycophyte]] ''[[Baragwanathia]]''. From the [[Devonian]], detailed fossils of [[rhyniophyte]]s have been found. Early fossils of these ancient plants show the individual cells within the plant tissue. The Devonian period also saw the evolution of the first tree in the fossil record, ''[[Wattezia]]''. This fern-like tree had a trunk with  fronds, and produced [[spores]]. 
 
 The [[coal measure]]s are a major source of [[Palaeozoic]] plant fossils, with many groups of plants in existence at this time. The spoil heaps of coal mines are the best places to collect; [[coal]] itself is the remains of fossilised plants, though structural detail of the plant fossils is rarely visible in coal. In the Fossil Forest at Victoria Park in [[Glasgow]] the stumps of ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' trees are found in their original growth positions.
