 A '''reflex''' (/ˈriːfleks/) < ref > https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reflex < /ref >  or '''reflex action''' is an [[wikt:automatic|automatic]] and fast movement in response to a [[stimulus]]. < ref > Purves 2004. ''Neuroscience''. 3rd ed, Massachusetts, Sinauer Associates. < /ref >    
 
 A true reflex is a [[behaviour]] done by the '''reflex arc'''. This is the path the signal of a reflex takes. That path is from the outside stimulus to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), then the path from the CNS to the appropriate muscle.  
 
 The [[nerve cell]]s responsible for reflexes are not always in the [[brain]], but often in the [[spinal cord]]. This way, reflexes are processed faster. Nerve cells in the brain still get feedback that the reflex action occurred. And, of course, reflex actions involving [[sight]] and [[sound]] are done by the brain. With [[invertebrate]] animals, the brain is not so dominant, and more is done by local reflex arcs in the [[segment]]s. 
 
 Reflexes may take place even after death. The bite of a poisonous snake can be [[releaser|triggered]] up to several hours after it has died. < ref > Texas man nearly dies after being bitten by severed snake head. ''BBC News''.  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44392861] < /ref > 
 
 If the behaviour is complex, the stimulus is called a [[releaser]], and the behaviour which follows may involve the whole animal for a long time in what is called a [[fixed action pattern]]. However, this is not the usual use of the term  " reflex " . It is studied in [[ethology]] because it usually involves two animals of the same species. 
 
 *The word 'reflex' can also be used as a [[metaphor]] for something done quickly, without much thinking.
