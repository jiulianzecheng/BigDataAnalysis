 '''Crustaceans''' are a [[phylum|subphylum]] of [[arthropod]]s with 67,000 described [[species]]. They are part of the phylum [[Arthropoda]]. Crustaceans include [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[crayfish]], [[shrimp]], [[krill]] and [[barnacle]]s. They are relatives of [[insects]]. If the Arthropods are regarded as a [[superphylum]], then the insects and crustacea would be phyla (see [[List of animal phyla]]). The group has an extensive [[fossil]] record, reaching back to the [[Cambrian]]. 
 
 Most crustaceans are [[aquatic]], mostly [[Ocean|marine]]. Some have moved onto land permanently. Crustaceans that live on land include some crabs, and [[woodlice]]. Crustacea range in size from a [[parasite]] 0.1mm long, to the  [[Japanese spider crab]] with a leg span of up to 14 & nbsp;ft (4.3 m) and a mass of 44 & nbsp;lb (20 & nbsp;kg). The North Atlantic [[lobster]] can weigh more than 40 pounds. 
 
 Most crustaceans are [[mobile]], but some become [[sessile]] after their [[larva]]l stage. [[Barnacle]]s are crustacea which become attached to rocks on the sea [[shore]]. Some are [[parasite|parasitic]], like  [[fish]] [[lice]], and [[tongue worm]]s. Crustacea usually have separate sexes, however some are [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]. Their eggs eventually hatch into larvae. 
 
 Crustaceans are a subphylum in the phylum Arthropoda, so they have a tough exoskeleton, a series of jointed appendages, and a segmented body. Crustaceans have three major body parts. They are, front to back: head, < ref name= " cephalon " > {{cite web |url=http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Cephalon |title=Cephalon |work=Crustacean Glossary |publisher=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County |accessdate=2016-09-10 |archive-date=2011-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124332/http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Cephalon |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  thorax, < ref name= " thorax " > {{cite web |url=http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Thorax |title=Thorax |work=Crustacean Glossary |publisher=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County |accessdate=2016-09-10 |archive-date=2011-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124551/http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Thorax |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and abdomen. < ref name= " abdomen " > {{cite web |url=http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Abdomen |title=Abdomen |work=Crustacean Glossary |publisher=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County |accessdate=2016-09-10 |archive-date=2011-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727123419/http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Abdomen |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They have two pairs of [[antenna]]e, and two [[eye]]s. The mouth has two [[mandible]] < nowiki/ > s. Most breathe with [[gill]]s, although some land [[crab]]s have developed [[lung]]s. [[Lobster]]s and [[crab]]s have hard outer skeletons (exoskeleton), and tend to preserve well as [[fossil]]s. As adults, they [[moult]] their shells as they grow in size. 
 
 Most large crustaceans crawl along the bottoms of streams, rivers, and the ocean, sometimes coming on land. Because they move along the ground under the water, they are called ''benthic'' creatures. Even though [[lobster]]s and [[shrimp]]s can [[swim]] a bit, they usually walk along the bottom of the body of water in which they live. 
 
 More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by [[fishery]] or [[farming]] for human consumption, most of it is shrimps and prawns. [[Krill]] and [[copepod]]s are not as widely fished, but they have the greatest animal  biomass on the planet, and form a vital part of the food chain. < ref name= " Britannica " > {{cite book|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/144848/crustacean/33799/Natural-history#|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|chapter=Crustacean (arthropod)|accessdate=}} < /ref > < ref name= " Canada " > {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE & Params=A1ARTA0002059|title=Crustacean|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=|author=Aiken D.E|archive-date=2011-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607134942/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE & Params=A1ARTA0002059|url-status=dead|date=2011|others=contributors: V.

 == Growth and development == 
 All crustacea must replace their [[exoskeleton]]s with new ones in order to grow.  They replace their exoskeletons by moulting. Moulting is controlled by [[hormones]]. A new exoskeleton is then secreted to replace the old one. While they wait for their new exoskeleton to harden it can be dangerous. They may be preyed on by larger predators and not be able to defend themselves. Most crustaceans moult many times between hatching and adulthood.

 == Larvae == 
 [[File:Krillanatomykils.jpg|thumb|right|Body structure of a typical crustacean – krill]] 
 
 Crustaceans have a number of larval forms. The earliest and most characteristic is the [[nauplius]]. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the ''zoea'' (pl. zoeæ or zoeas). This name was given to it when naturalists believed it to be a separate species. < ref > {{cite book|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Crab|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|author=Calman, William Thomas|year=1911|chapter=Crab}} < /ref >  It follows the nauplius stage, and often has spikes on its [[carapace]]. These may assist these small organisms in swimming. < ref > {{cite journal |quote=no |author=Weldon W.F.R. |year=1889 |title=Note on the function of the spines of the Crustacean zoœa |journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169–172 |url=http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/16/01/Note_on_the_Function_of_the_Spines_of_the_Crustacean_Zooea.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0025315400057994 |s2cid=54759780 |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717055819/http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/16/01/Note_on_the_Function_of_the_Spines_of_the_Crustacean_Zooea.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In many [[Decapoda|decapods]], due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first larval stage. In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the ''mysis'' stage, and in others, by the ''megalopa'' stage, depending on the crustacean group involved. < ref name= " Gurney " > {{cite book |author=Robert Gurney |year=1942 |title=Larvae of decapod crustacea |location=London |publisher=Ray Society |pages=1–306 |url=http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/12852/12852.pdf }} < /ref >
