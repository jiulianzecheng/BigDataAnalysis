 In [[Egyptian mythology]], '''Ra''' was the [[Deity|god]] of the [[sun]][[light]], [[day]], [[universe]], [[creation]], [[fertility]] , [[birth]], [[truth]], [[prophecy]], [[sky]], [[order]] and [[kings]] . He was the most important god in [[Ancient Egypt]]. He had many names, such as Amun-Ra, and Ra-Horakhty. It was said he was born each morning in the East, and died each night in the West. In the night he travelled through the underworld. This is why the west side of the Nile was known as the land of the dead. He had the head of a Falcon, the body of a man, and was the king of the Egyptian gods. 
 
 == Name == 
 Ra was thought to be the god of the sun and [[creation]]. Ra’s name came from Re and Amun. The name Re was from Upper Egypt and the name Amun came from Lower Egypt. When Upper and Lower Egypt came together they changed the name to Amun-Re. Over thousands of years the name Amun-Re evolved into Amun-Ra and then just to Ra. From then on people called him Re or Ra. Ra used to mean “mouth” in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian language]]. Some names are: Re, the Creator, Khepry, etc. 
 
 == Looks == 
 
 Ra has many forms. His best-known form is the man with the head of a falcon and the sun disk above him. He may also be depicted as a [[scarab beetle]] or a man. One is Amun-Ra, which is a ram and the other, Ra-Hakorthaty which is a sky sun god. 
 
 == Friends and enemies == 
 Some time around the Middle Kingdom, Ra and [[Osiris]] became friends. This was unusual because [[Osiris]] lived in the Underworld and Ra lived in the Heavens. All the other gods wanted to be friends with Ra. They hoped that if they were friends with Ra, Ra would tell them his hidden name. But Ra did have some enemies. [[Seth]] was sometimes Ra’s enemy, but Seth ''did'' help Ra fight [[Apep]], a snake god. The fact that Seth helped Ra reminded all of the gods that [[Seth]] was not all bad. [[Isis]] was another enemy of Ra, she had tricked him into giving her his hidden name so her husband Osiris could be king of the gods. 
 
 === Worship === 
 The [[cult]] of Ra began to grow from around the time of the [[II Dynasty]], establishing Ra as the sun god. By the [[IV Dynasty]], the [[Pharaoh]]s were seen as  " Sons of Ra " . His [[worship]] increased much in the [[V Dynasty]], when he became a state [[deity]]. Pharaohs had [[pyramid]]s, [[obelisk]]s, and solar [[temples]] built in his honor. 
 
 == Powers == 
 Ra was believed to be the greatest Egyptian god when it came to powers. His powers live in his hidden name. Only he knew his hidden name so only he could use the powers. It was said that he had the best powers throughout the land. He could make anything, he made people, he made the world, and he made the heavens. That is how great his powers were. One day Isis wanted to have his powers so she sent a serpent to poison him on his daily walk. The serpents venomous bite was so painful that Ra gave in and told her his secret name of creation.Then Isis banished Ra to the Duat, (Spirit World), so Osiris her husband could be king. 
 
 == Family == 
 Ra's daughter with Nut (his granddaughter) was named [[Hathor]], the goddess of love. Ra had two children [[Shu]], the god of air and [[Tefnut]], the goddess of morning dew. They had two children named [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], the goddess of the sky and [[Geb]], the god of earth. They had four children named Isis, the goddess of home, [[Nephthys]], the goddess of mourning, [[Seth|Set]], the god of the desert, and [[Osiris]], god of the afterlife. They paired up and had two more children, [[Anubis]], god of embalming, and [[Horus]], god of the sky.
