If G is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and H a [[subgroup]] of G, x is an element in G, and h is an element in H the '''cosets''' of H in G are defined as follows:  
 
 *Left coset: xH is the set of all the elements h of H multiplied by x on the left.  
 *Right coset: Hx is the set of all the elements h of H multiplied by x on the right.  
 
 When xH = Hx we say that H is normal in G.
