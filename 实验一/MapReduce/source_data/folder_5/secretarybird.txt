 The '''secretarybird''' (''Sagittarius serpentarius'') is a large [[wikt:terrestrial|terrestrial]] [[bird of prey]]. It is usually found in African [[savanna]]s and open [[grassland]]s. 
 
 Unlike most birds of prey, the secretarybird hunts its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as family flocks. They stalk through the grass with long strides. Prey includes [[insects]], [[mammals]] from [[mice]] to [[hare]]s and [[mongoose]], [[crabs]], [[lizards]], [[snakes]], [[tortoises]], young birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in grass or [[bushfire]]s. 
 
 The bird is famous for hunting [[snake]]s. It even hunts venomous [[cobra]]s and other [[reptile]]s. Its claws are weak and [[wikt:blunt|blunt]], so to make a kill, it stomps on its victim, breaking its back. 
 
 It is put in its own family on the basis of molecular [[sequence analysis]]. < ref name=wink  > Wink, Michael; Seibold I.; Lotfikhah F.  &  Bednarek W. 1998.
