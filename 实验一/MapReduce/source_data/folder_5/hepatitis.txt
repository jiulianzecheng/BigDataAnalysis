 '''Hepatitis''' is a disease of the [[liver]]. In hepatitis, the liver is [[inflammation|inflamed]]. There can be several reasons why the liver is inflamed. For this reason there are several kinds of hepatitis. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|title=Esto es la hepatitis: Conócela, enfréntate a ella|url=https://www.infoterio.com/2022/08/Esto-es-la-hepatitis-Conocela-enfrentate-a-ella.html|access-date=2023-02-16|website=Infoterio Noticias {{!}} Ciencia y Tecnología|language=es}} < /ref >  The most common forms are '''[[Hepatitis A]]''', '''[[Hepatitis B]]''' and '''[[Hepatitis C]]'''. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Most cases of Hepatitis are caused by [[virus]]es. Some forms are caused by [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]] or [[parasite]]s. The bacteria that cause [[tuberculosis]] or [[syphilis]] can also cause hepatitis; so can the parasite that causes [[malaria]].  
 
 Hepatitis can also be caused by [[alcohol]]. About one in four people who drink more than three [[alcoholic drink]]s a day (over a period of 10–15 days) will have some form of hepatitis caused by alcohol. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Various [[drug]]s and [[chemical]]s can also cause hepatitis, most notably [[paracetamol]] ([[overdose]]), yellow [[phosphorous]], and others. Hepatitis may also be caused by other diseases. 
 
 ==Hepatitis A== 
 {{main|Hepatitis A}} 
 Hepatitis A can be spread through personal contact, eating raw [[seafood]], or drinking water with the hepatitis A virus in it. This happens mostly in [[third world]] countries. Strict personal [[hygiene]] and avoiding raw and unpeeled foods can help prevent an infection.  
 
 Once a person has hepatitis A, their [[immune system]] makes [[antibody|antibodies]] to fight the virus. This will make them [[Immunity|immune]] against future infection.  
 
 People with hepatitis A should rest, drink a lot of water and avoid alcohol. The time between the infection and the start of the illness can run from 15 to 45 days.  About 15% of people with hepatitis A have [[symptom]]s from six months to a year after the first [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Infected people [[excretion|excrete]] the hepatitis A virus in their [[Feces|stool]] two weeks before and one week after the appearance of [[jaundice]].  
 
 There is a [[vaccine]] for hepatitis A. It will protect against hepatitis A for life.  
 
 ==Hepatitis B== 
 {{main|Hepatitis B}} 
 Hepatitis B is not spread by food or casual contact.  Instead, hepatitis B is spread by [[blood]] or body fluids from an infected person.  A baby can [[Vertical transmission|get it from its mother during childbirth]], and it can also be [[Sexually transmitted disease|spread by sexual contact]], use of [[Illegal drugs|street drugs]], and unsafe medical care.  Some people just have hepatitis B for a little while and then suppress the infection. Others can be infected for life, usually with few or no symptoms for many years.  Hepatitis B sometimes damages the liver severely, and can cause [[cancer]] and [[cirrhosis]].   
 
 There is a vaccine that can prevent hepatitis B.  There is no cure for hepatitis B, but there is [[Therapy|treatment]]. 
 
 ==Hepatitis C== 
 {{main|Hepatitis C}} 
 Hepatitis C is not spread by food or casual contact.  It is spread in ways that are similar to hepatitis B.  There is no vaccine, and the treatment is somewhat unpleasant.  People with hepatitis C who drink alcohol greatly increase their risk for liver damage.
