 A '''machine''' is a thing that is created by people to make work easier. It is a [[tool]] or [[invention]] which multiplies the effect of human effort. The machine produces a [[mechanical advantage]]. 
 
 Some machines have many parts that move. Examples are [[bicycle]]s and [[clock]]s. 
 
 Some machines do not have parts that move. Examples are [[computer]]s and [[telephone]]s. 
 
 People have used machines since before there was [[history]].
