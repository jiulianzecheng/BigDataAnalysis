'''Astatine''' is a [[Radioactive decay|radioactive,]] [[chemical element]]. Its [[atomic number]] is 85, and its [[atomic weight]] is 210. It is part of the Group 17 ([[halogen]]s) on the [[periodic table of elements]]. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.3 hours. 
 
 == History == 
 The first creation of the element was in 1940 by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio G. Segrè at the University of California, Berkeley, who named it from the Greek ''estates'' (ἄστατος), meaning  " unstable " . < ref name= " Davis-1959 " > {{Cite book|url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/pardir/Book%20Reviews/The_Chemical_Elements.pdf|title=The Chemical Elements|last=Davis|first=Helen Miles|publisher=[[Science Service]], [[Ballantine Books]]|year=1959|edition=2nd|pages=29|access-date=14 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823203118/http://nova.wpunj.edu/pardir/Book%20Reviews/The_Chemical_Elements.pdf|archive-date=23 August 2017|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 Astatine is highly radioactive and all its [[Isotope|isotopes]] have half-lives of approximately 8 hours or less, the longest being astatine-210 with a half-life of a bit over eight hours. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Geerd-J|date=2018-02-22|title=Astatine|journal=Journal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals|volume=61|issue=3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1002/jlcr.3573|pmid=29080397|issn=0362-4803}} < /ref >  Some of its [[isotopes]] may be found in nature, but because it is so [[unstable]], only about an [[ounce]] exists in the [[Earth's crust]] at any point in time. Chemists say it is the rarest element in the Earth's crust. Less reactive than [[iodine]], astatine is the least reactive of the halogens. Only a few compounds with metals have been found, in the form of astatides of [[sodium]], [[palladium]], [[silver]], [[thallium]], and [[lead]].
