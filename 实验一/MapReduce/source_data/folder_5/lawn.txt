 A '''lawn''' is an area of land planted with [[grass]], and sometimes [[clover]] and other plants. Lawns are cut to a low, even height using a [[lawnmower]]. Lawns are used for [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] (for their beauty) and [[recreation]]al purposes. Other words used to describe them are turf, [[pitch]], [[field]] or [[Golf course|green]] may be used, depending on the sport and the [[continent]]. They are often found around buildings, making them a type of [[Yard (land)|yard]]. 
 
 Lawns are generally composed only of grass species, subject to [https://lawncareguides.com/how-to-get-rid-of-weeds-in-lawn/ weed] and [[pest control]], < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=How to control pests in your lawn|url=https://www.pest-control-services.org.uk/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-23|website=www.pest-control-services.org.uk}} < /ref >  maintained in green colour, < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Basics of Lawn Maintenance|url=https://www.artificialpitchmaintenance.co.uk/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-23|website=www.artificialpitchmaintenance.co.uk}} < /ref >  and are regularly maintained to ensure an acceptable length. Lawns are used around, apartments, houses, commercial buildings and offices. Approximately 80% of all homes in the United States have grass lawns. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The American Obsession with Lawns|url=https://www.synthetic-grass-installation.co.uk/|archive-url=|archive-date=|website=www.synthetic-grass-installation.co.uk}} < /ref >  This has resulted in a $40 billion per year industry, with American grass lawns using more water than is used to grow all the wheat and corn in the United States.  In that sense, by water consumption, grass is the United States’ leading “crop” by far, with the Environmental Protection Agency estimating that about 1/3 of all public water is used to water grass, with that number rising as high as 70% in some of the more dry regions of the United States. 
 
 The earliest mention of lawns comes from [[France]] during the 1500s. < ref name= " Robbins19.21 " > Paul Robbins, ''Lawn People: How Grasses, Weeds, and Chemicals Make Us Who We Are'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2007), pp. 19–21 < /ref >  Lawns (as opposed to fields) found their way to [[England]] in the 1700s. < ref name= " Robbins19.21 "  / >  One [[acre]] (0.4 hectare) of lawn would take three [[gardener]]s all day to mow using a tool called a [[scythe]]. < ref name= " Robbins19.21 "  / >  Two centuries later, one person with a [[lawnmower]] could do it in an afternoon.

 == History == 
 In the 16th Century Renaissance, lawns were deliberately cultivated by the wealthy in both France and England, though they were more likely planted with chamomile or thyme than with grass. Both of these ground covers make excellent alternatives to grass in modern lawns. 
 
 Closely shorn grass lawns first emerged in 17th century England at the homes of large, wealthy landowners. While sheep were still grazed on many such park-lands, landowners increasingly depended on human labor to tend the grass closest to their homes.  Only the rich could afford to hire the many hands needed to scythe and weed the grass, so a lawn was a mark of wealth and status.
