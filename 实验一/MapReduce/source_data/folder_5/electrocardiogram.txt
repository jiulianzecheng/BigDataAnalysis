 An '''electrocardiogram''' ('''ECG''' or '''EKG''') is a record of the [[electrical]] activity of the [[heart]] over a period of time.  The instrument that makes the record is the ECG machine or Electrocardiograph.  [[Willem Einthoven]] invented it.  It works by attaching [[electrode]]s to the outer surface of the [[skin]].  
 
 An electrocardiogram monitors the heart.  Each beat of the heart is triggered by an electrical impulse, normally generated from special cells in the upper right chamber of the heart.  An electrocardiogram records these electrical signals as they travel through the heart.  Doctors can use an electrocardiogram to look for patterns among these [[heartbeat]]s and [[rhythm]]s to diagnose various heart conditions. 
 
 ECG is used to measure the rate and regularity of [[heartbeat]]s, the size and position of the chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, such as an [[artificial pacemaker]]. 
 
 An electrocardiogram is a painless test. The results of your electrocardiogram will likely be reported immediately after it is done.
