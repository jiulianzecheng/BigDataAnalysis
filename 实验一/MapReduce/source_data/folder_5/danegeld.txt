The '''Danegeld''' ( " Danish tax " ) was a tax that the English kingdoms paid to the [[Viking]]s between the [[9th century|9th]] and [[11th century|11th centuries]]. The Vikings called it “geld” or “gafol” in the 11th century, but the term Danegeld did not appear until the early [[12th century]]. 
 
 Besides the taxes in England, the term also applies to [[Eastern Europe]] in the 9th century, where Sami, Finnish, and Slavic tribes paid taxes to the Swedes. In Francia ([[France]]), the Franks paid off the Vikings in Normandy (Normans), and in return, the Normans would convert to [[Christianity]] and cease to raid.
