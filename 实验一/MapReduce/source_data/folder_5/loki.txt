 '''Loki''' ({{IPA-non|ˈloki|lang}},  < small > often Anglicized as < /small >  {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|oʊ|k|i}}) is a [[Æsir|god]] in [[Norse mythology]]. Loki is  the son of [[Fárbauti]]  and the brother of [[Helblindi]] and [[Býleistr]]. Loki is married to [[Sigyn]]. They have a son, [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]].  Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[Jörmungandr]].  While in the form of a horse, Loki was [[pregnant|impregnated]] by [[Svaðilfari]] and gave birth to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. Loki is referred to as the father of [[Váli]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]''. This source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of Váli twice and Váli is only said to be a son of Loki once. 
 
 Loki's relation with the gods varies by source. Loki sometimes helps the gods and sometimes behaves badly towards them. Loki can change his shape. He has appeared in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an old woman named [[Þökk]] . Loki's good relations with the gods end with his role in causing the death of the god [[Baldr]]. During [[Ragnarök]], Loki is said to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[Jötunn|jötnar]]. He will fight the god [[Heimdallr]], and they two will kill each other. 
 
 Loki is talked about in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'',  the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s and in [[Scandinavia]]n [[folklore]]. Loki may be shown on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Scholars disagree about Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology. Some have described him as a [[trickster god]].
